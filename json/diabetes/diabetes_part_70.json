The distribution and multiple forms of hexokinase activity in lactating rat mammary gland were investigated in alloxan-diabetic rats and in rats treated with anti-insulin serum. It was found that 46% of the total hexokinase of mammary-gland tissue from control rats was in the particulate fraction, but this percentage was decreased in the alloxan-diabetic rats to 11% of the total hexokinase. The hexokinase activity of the soluble fraction was not significantly altered but there was a decrease in the type II/type I quotient. 2. The early changes that occurred on insulin deprivation were studied 1hr. after administration of anti-insulin serum to lactating rats, at which time the hexokinase bound to the particulate fraction had decreased to 11% of the control value and that in the soluble fraction had increased by approx. 50%. The hexokinase type II/type I quotient in the soluble fraction was significantly decreased. These results suggested that there was a release of particulate-bound hexokinase in rats treated with anti-insulin serum.</AbstractText>"}

The incidence of each type of vaginitis is recorded. Analysis of results of treatment with six compounds currently used in the therapy of vaginitis indicated that acetarsol or pimaricin compounds, with their broader spectra of activity, appeared to be most useful, prior to establishment of a definite diagnosis by means of cultures. Chlordantoin is an effective antifungal agent and is associated with a high percentage of 'culture cures'. Resistant cases should be investigated for diabetes mellitus, and many are aided by a low carbohydrate diet. Metronidazole was used only for resistant cases of trichomoniasis, with a cure rate of over 80% when both partners were treated simultaneously. Triple-sulfa vaginal cream was effective in over 80% of patients with nonspecific vaginitis; no cases of resistant bacterial infections were encountered. Dienestrol cream was effective in relieving the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis.</AbstractText>"}

There are, however, many instances in which the nature of the arterial disease prevents performance of direct arterial surgery. In these cases an increase in circulation to the skin may not only relieve pain and heal ulcers but also, not infrequently, save the limb from amputation or permit a minor rather than a major amputation.A consecutive group of 90 lumbar and cervicodorsal sympathectomies was reviewed. The majority of patients suffered from atherosclerosis; smaller numbers had Buerger's or Raynaud's disease. The assessment of patients, selection for surgery, technique of operation, its complications and early results are discussed. There was one death in this series of patients who ranged in age from 17 to 81 years. This study indicates that, although sympathectomy is not a panacea for obliterative arterial disease, neither is it an obsolete procedure.</AbstractText>"}

The human factor is responsible for the majority of traffic accidents. The literature concerning the human factor is reviewed, and it is concluded that psychosocial influences are most important, though medical conditions may be responsible for 3 to 4% of accidents. Problems concerning the medical examination of drivers are discussed and the need is emphasized to find some means of removing from the road those drivers who continue to drive in spite of repeated medical advice not to do so. Some of the medical conditions influencing driver safety are discussed. It is recommended that each Division of The Canadian Medical Association should publish a guide for physicians who examine drivers. The advantages of a uniform guide in Canada are stressed.</AbstractText>"}

Though the Indian patients studied had altogether different social customs, living standards, and dietary habits from Western people, the relative incidence of various cerebral vascular lesions did not differ significantly. Irrespective of the poor nutritional status of the patients, thrombosis associated with atherosclerosis was chiefly responsible for a non-embolic cerebral infarction. Atherothrombosis in the young normotensive persons not showing any evidence of arteritis, diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolaemia was also identified.The grave risks involved in cerebral angiography in cases of acute stroke are re-emphasized.As to prognosis, the nutritional status, the type and territory of an ictal lesion, and the blood levels of sugar and cholesterol had no significant influence on the immediate survival-after a non-embolic cerebral infarction. However, a significantly greater number of deaths were encountered in the hypertensive patients. Female patients and patients with a large cerebral infarction had a poor prognosis.</AbstractText>"}

With the use of reliable methods, children selected from screening of the total population were individually studied by means of parental interviews and questionaries, neurological examination and psychiatric assessment of each child, information from school teachers, and perusal of the records of hospitals and other agencies. The association between organic brain dysfunction and psychiatric disorder was studied by comparing the findings in the children with epilepsy or with lesions above the brain stem (cerebral palsy and similar disorders) with those in (1) a random sample of the general population, (2) children with lesions below the brain stem (for example, muscular dystrophy or paralyses following poliomyelitis), and (3) children with other chronic physical handicaps not involving the nervous system (for example, asthma, heart disease, or diabetes).Psychiatric disorders in children with neuro-epileptic conditions were five times as common as in the general population and three times as common as in children with chronic physical handicaps not involving the brain. It was concluded, on the basis of a study of factors associated with psychiatric disorder, that the high rate of psychiatric disorder in the neuro-epileptic children was due to the presence of organic brain dysfunction rather than just the existence of a physical handicap (though this also played a part). However, organic brain dysfunction was not associated with any specific type of disorder. Within the neuro-epileptic group the neurological features and the type of fit, intellectual/educational factors, and socio-familial factors all interacted in the development of psychiatric disorder.</AbstractText>"}

The alloxan-diabetic rabbits consumed significantly higher quantities of cholesterol and food and had serum cholesterol and lipoprotein (S(f) 5-9 and S(f) 16-30) concentrations significantly increased over the control levels. They failed to show a commensurate increase in the degree of atherosclerosis. Rabbits in which the diabetogenic action of alloxan was prevented by temporary occlusion of the pancreas from the circulation during its administration developed grades of hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, and atherosclerosis not significantly different from the controls. The results are interpreted as indicating that the effects of alloxan on tissues other than the pancreas do not protect against experimental atherosclerosis produced by cholesterol feeding.</AbstractText>"}

Only five followed oral use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although anogenital pruritus commonly follows the use of such drugs, it is rarely proved to be moniliasis, which is clinically diagnosed by symptoms of intertriginous denudation with satellite vesicopustules or the presence of cheesy, grossly detachable plaques. The diagnosis may be confirmed by microscopic observation of delicate hyphae and clusters of spores, or of chlamydospores on corn meal agar. One per cent aqueous gentian violet, 0.1 per cent gentian violet jel, or locally applied mercurials are the most effective forms of treatment, but effort must also be directed against predisposing factors (obesity, hyperhidrosis, oral or local use of broad spectrum antibiotics, diabetes and pregnancy).</AbstractText>"}

The decreased capacity of diabetic animals to synthesize nicotinic acid is therefore attributed to increased amounts of picolinic carboxylase, which competes for a common intermediate with the spontaneous reaction in which quinolinic acid is formed as a precursor of nicotinic acid. These studies were facilitated by the synthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid labeled with carbon-14 in positions 3 and 6</AbstractText>"}

The necropsy examination revealed granulomatous infiltration of the infra-orbital fat, the pituitary stalk, and the posterior lobe of the pituitary and also of the skull bones and the thyroid cartilage. The spinal dura mater contained multiple xanthomatous deposits which had produced degenerative changes in the cord substance by epidural compression. Interesting features were the tumour-like enlargement of the right heart, massive pancreatic and renal infiltration, also heavy constricting xanthomatous mantles which had produced compression of both kidneys and adrenal glands. Case 2 is an example of xanthomatous granuloma, confined to the lungs, in a man of 57 years, and not associated with diabetes insipidus. The histological appearances were those of long-standing chronic xanthoma with marked cystic changes in the lungs, dilated bronchioles, and thick-walled stenosed pulmonary arteries. The pathogenesis of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease is briefly discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Excellent results were obtained in the treatment of macular edema following cataract surgery and in older patients with diabetic retinopathy. In 126 out of 145 patients with senile macular degeneration, improvement or stabilization was obtained.For all the types of macular degeneration, nylidrin HCl was the most effective of the drugs studied and had the fewest side effects.A recent report based upon animal experiments advises against the use of peripheral vasodilators in degenerative arterial diseases of the eye; however, the assumption made therein that blood volume is a measure of blood flow cannot be accepted. Peripheral vasodilator therapy, which long-term clinical study has shown to be valuable in the treatment of macular degeneration, should not therefore be denied to these patients.</AbstractText>"}

Brittleness is redefined as 'a syndrome of excessive insulin-sensitivity and ketosis-proneness manifested by extreme and unexplainable short-term and long-term fluctuations in the parameters of the disease'. Evidence on the causation of hyperlability points to dysfunction of plasma-protein transport and of hepatic and peripheral tissue metabolism of insulin. No objectively demonstrable complete and lasting stabilization was possible by means of any antidiabetic or adjunctive therapeutic measures. However, achievement of quantitative improvement in the accuracy of regulation of diabetes and moderation in deviations from the acceptable range of parameters were feasible. To this end, therapy recommended for everyday use incorporates the following principles found to be most helpful in following the oscillations of the disease on the research ward: flexibility in the plan of therapy; accuracy, especially in timing of therapeutic events; and employment of an insulin program best suited to the patient's needs and comfort.</AbstractText>"}

The overall metabolic changes in lactating mammary gland in alloxan-diabetic and anti-insulin-serum-treated rats were assessed by measurement of the incorporation of (14)C from specifically labelled glucose, pyruvate and acetate into carbon dioxide and lipid, together with measurements of enzymes concerned with the pentose phosphate pathway and with citrate metabolism. 2. Alloxan-diabetes depressed the rate of formation of (14)CO(2) from [1-(14)C]glucose and [2-(14)C]glucose to approx. 10% of the control rate; this was partially reversed by addition of insulin in vitro. The quotient Oxidation of [1-(14)C]glucose/Oxidation of [6-(14)C]glucose fell from a value of 17.6 in the control group to 3.9 in the diabetic group and was restored to 14.3 in the presence of insulin in vitro. In keeping with these results it was shown that glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities were significantly decreased in alloxan-diabetic rats. 3. Alloxan-diabetes depressed the decarboxylation and the oxidation of labelled pyruvate, but not the oxidation of labelled acetate. 4. The synthesis of lipid from specifically labelled glucose was greatly decreased, that from [2-(14)C]pyruvate was almost unchanged and that from [1-(14)C]acetate alone was increased in alloxandiabetic rats. However, the stimulation of lipid synthesis from acetate by glucose was small in the alloxan-diabetic rats compared with the controls. Insulin in vitro partially reversed all these effects. Both citrate-cleavage enzyme and acetate thiokinase activities were decreased in alloxan-diabetic rats. 5. Treatment of rats with anti-insulin serum depressed the formation of (14)CO(2) from [1-(14)C]glucose and [2-(14)C]glucose, but increased that from [6-(14)C]glucose. This was completely restored by the presence of insulin in vitro. The quotient Oxidation of [1-(14)C]glucose/Oxidation of [6-(14)C]glucose fell from a value of 17.6 in the control group to 3.8 in the anti-insulin-serum-treated group. There were no changes in the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase or 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, but the hexokinase distribution changed and the content of the soluble fraction increased significantly. 6. The synthesis of lipid from specifically labelled glucose was depressed in anti-insulin-serum-treated rats; this effect was completely reversed by addition of insulin in vitro to the tissue slices.</AbstractText>"}

With this procedure it has been possible to obtain an objective evaluation of the significance of capillary basement membrane hypertrophy in diabetic microangiopathy. The results of such studies of muscle capillary basement membrane thickness in 50 normal, 51 diabetic, and 30 prediabetic patients have demonstrated the following. First, that the average capillary basement membrane width of diabetic patients is over twice that of normal subjects; moreover, such basement membrane thickening is a very constant finding among overtly diabetic patients, in that approximately 98% of individual diabetic subjects demonstrated this lesion. The degree of basement membrane thickening in diabetic patients is, however, unrelated to age, weight, severity, or duration of diabetes. Second, capillary basement membrane hypertrophy has been found in approximately 50% of patients who are genetically prediabetic but who have not yet demonstrated evidence of the manifest carbohydrate disturbances of diabetes mellitus. Third, in contrast to the results obtained in genetically diabetic patients, subjects with severe hyperglycemia due to causes other than genetic diabetes only infrequently show basement membrane hypertrophy. These results indicate that thickening of the muscle capillary basement membranes is a characteristic of genetic diabetes mellitus, and further, that the hyperglycemia of diabetes is probably not the factor responsible for the microangiopathy characteristic of diabetes mellitus. Finally, the discovery of thickened capillary basement membranes in prediabetic patients suggests that basement membrane hypertrophy is a relatively early lesion of the diabetic syndrome and provides further support for the conclusion that this vascular defect is independent of carbohydrate derangements of diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":5675421,"Title":"Insulin delivery rate into plasma in normal and diabetic subjects.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Sep 1968","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Removal of insulin-(131)I from plasma was studied in normal and diabetic subjects with both single injection and continuous infusion of isotope techniques. Patients were studied either in the fasting state or during steady-state hyperglycemia produced by a continuous intravenous glucose infusion. Steady-state plasma insulin concentration during these studies ranged from 10 to 264 muU/ml. Labeled insulin specific activity time curves consisted of more than one exponential, indicating that a multicompartmental system for insulin metabolism exists. A mathematical technique which is applicable to non-first order processes was used to calculate the rate at which insulin was lost irreversibly from the plasma insulin pool. A direct, linear relationship was found between insulin irreversible loss rate and plasma insulin concentration over the range of concentrations studied. This linearity implies lack of saturability of the insulin removal mechanism. Since the plasma insulin pool was in a steady state during these studies, insulin irreversible loss rate was equal to the rate at which newly secreted insulin was being delivered to the general circulation. Therefore, these results indicate that changes in plasma insulin concentration result from parallel changes in the rate of insulin delivery and not from changes in the opposite direction of the rate of insulin removal. A wide range of insulin delivery rates was found among patients with similar plasma glucose concentrations, suggesting that there exists considerable variability in responsiveness to endogenous insulin among these patients.</AbstractText>"}

It thus appears that involutional osteoporosis will be less prevalent among old women suffering from diabetes mellitus than in comparable non-diabetic subjects, and more prevalent among non-diabetics of low body weight than in old women who are obese or of normal weight.</AbstractText>"}

Ten of these patients were pregnant. All 15 of the non-gravid patients were cured, as proved by repeated cultures, after a maximum of three weeks of therapy. Eight of the 10 gravid patients were cured. Of the two patients with resistant cases, one had severe diabetes and the other had endocervicitis. Of 50 patients treated by insertion of Candeptin vaginal tablets, 42 became free of vaginal moniliasis after one or two 14-day courses of home treatment. All 42 remained free of infection for one month following treatment, as proven by culture. There were no instances of sensitivity to the preparation.</AbstractText>"}

Twenty-eight per cent of the total population of 265 persons were found to be diabetic. In most of them the onset of diabetes was late in life and in the majority the disease was controlled by dietary measures alone. Of interest was the low incidence of gallbladder disease, hypercholesterolemia, ocular disease, myocardial and peripheral vascular disease. Neurological complications were minimal. The measures adopted to achieve biochemical stabilization in diabetes mellitus are discussed and the absence of acidosis and ketosis in this group is noted. The high incidence of diabetes, the need for detection of undiagnosed cases, and the low rate of complications are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

With the aim of producing diabetes insipidus in sheep, electrolytic lesions were placed in the ventral medial hypothalamus immediately posterior to the optic chiasm.2. After formation of lesions, the pattern of urine excretion showed a triphasic response consisting of (i) an immediate diuresis reaching a maximum within 4 days, (ii) an interphase of about 12 days wherein rates of urine flow were normal, and (iii) a final phase of permanent polyuria. With the four sheep used in this work, the time between placement of the lesions and onset of permanent hyposthenuria was 19-22 days.3. In the final polyuric phase, the sheep were unable to concentrate their urine in response to dehydration or to feeding.4. Infusions of arginine vasopressin restored the ability of these animals to excrete urine that was hypertonic to plasma.5. The evidence showed that the hypothalamic lesions were effective in producing permanent diabetes insipidus. It was concluded that anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) has essentially the same function in sheep as it has in other mammalian species; that is, the hormone facilitates the elaboration of hypertonic urine. There was no evidence to suggest that ADH had a special effect on potassium excretion in the sheep.</AbstractText>"}

The specific arginine vasopressin (AVP) zone was eluted and assayed for antidiuretic activity in the diuretic rat. Thioglycolate inactivation was used to confirm AVP activity. Recovery of as little as 4 muU AVP per ml plasma ranged between 80 and 90%. In normal subjects after an overnight fast, plasma AVP ranged between 2.5 and 10.0 muU per ml. AVP secretion was inhibited by hemodilution and stimulated with nicotine and hypertonic saline. Plasma AVP was absent in patients with diabetes insipidus even after neurohypophyseal stimulation. Plasma AVP was abnormally elevated during mild dehydration and remained above the normal range despite hemodilution in patients with untreated adrenocortical insufficiency demonstrating a delayed water diuresis. Glucosteroid therapy lowered plasma AVP to normal in dehydrated patients. A normal diuretic response to hydration was accompanied by a fall in plasma AVP to zero in steroid-treated patients. These findings suggest that hypersecretion of AVP may play an important role in the abnormal water metabolism of adrenocortical insufficiency and that the glucosteroids promote normal water diuresis by inhibiting the secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":5667251,"Title":"Activity and intracellular distribution of enzymes of ketone-body metabolism in rat liver.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Jul 1968","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. The activities of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and lyase in rat liver were found to be two- to 15-fold greater than those reported by other authors under similar conditions. 2. When expressed on the basis of body weight, no appreciable differences were found between the activities of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase in whole homogenates of livers from normal and starved rats. The synthase activity increased by 70% and 140% in livers of alloxan-diabetic rats and rats fed on a high-fat diet respectively. 3. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase activity showed no significant increases in starvation or alloxan-diabetes, but a 40% increase was found in fat-fed rats. 4. Less than 12% of the activities of both enzymes were found in the cytoplasmic fraction of normal liver. The cytoplasmic activity doubled in alloxan-diabetes and starvation; on feeding with a high-fat diet the increase, though significant, was less marked. 6. The intracellular distribution of glutamate dehydrogenase indicated that the changes in the cytoplasmic activities observed were not due to leakage from the mitochondria. 7. Feeding with a normal or high-fat diet after 48hr. starvation caused within 24hr. a decrease in the cytoplasmic activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase to values lower than those found in rats fed on a corresponding diet for a longer period of time. 8. Acetoacetyl-CoA deacylase activity in liver was about 20% of that of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and was primarily located in the cytoplasm. Starvation or alloxan-diabetes did not alter the acetoacetyl-CoA deacylase activity. 9. It is concluded that variations in the concentrations of enzymes involved in acetoacetate synthesis play no major role in the regulation of ketone-body formation in starvation and alloxan-diabetes. The changes in the cytoplasmic activities of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and lyase suggest that acetoacetate synthesis can occur in the cytoplasm. This may play a role in the disposal of surplus acetyl-CoA arising in the cytoplasm when lipogenesis is inhibited.</AbstractText>"}

Doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg orally produced progressively increasing diuretic responses. When given over a period of one week to patients with essential hypertension, furosemide in doses of 100 to 200 mg orally per day caused a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic pressure. A significant lowering of blood pressure was also demonstrated in hypertensive patients treated with furosemide over a period of one year. Biochemical alterations during furosemide administration included elevation of fasting blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes mellitus, increased uric acid concentrations, and lowering of plasma potassium levels. All biochemical changes were reversible when the drug was discontinued. No evidence of hematologic or hepatic dysfunction was observed in 16 patients who received furosemide in a daily dose of 40 to 160 mg over a 52-week period. Although furosemide has been recommended primarily for the treatment of edema refractory to other forms of therapy, long-term studies indicate that the drug is also capable of maintaining patients with chronic congestive heart failure without producing serious systemic toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

In both groups of animals a decrease in lipid content was accompanied by the formation of complex frond-like cytoplasmic processes and of loops and folds of basement membrane which extended from cell surfaces. These changes, evident after 1 day of fasting, increased in magnitude with increasing weight loss. As the lipid content of the cell decreased further, lipid-cytoplasmic interfaces became irregular and convoluted. Cytoplasmic microvesicles were prominent and appeared to be greatly increased in number. Rosette-like structures composed of microvesicles were observed in both lipid-depleted fat cells and endothelium. The interpretation of these changes and their physiological significance are discussed in terms of the physical and chemical properties of lipids and lipid metabolism. It is postulated that microvesicles may represent the mechanism of transport of free fatty acids in fat cells and in endothelium. Hypotheses are proposed and illustrated schematically for the mode of formation of microvesicular rosettes, for the mobilization and uptake of lipids by fat cells, and for the transport of lipids through endothelium.</AbstractText>"}

The diabetic state was controlled satisfactorily by diet and insulin, but early diabetic complications and patient education tended to be overlooked by physicians. Diabetic management from the nursing, administrative and dietetic standpoints was considered to be inefficient, unpredictable and incomplete.In 1955 a comprehensive diabetic service was instituted which co-ordinated the activities of medical, nursing and dietetic staffs and provided for patient education. A repeat survey conducted in 1961, in which the records of 87 consecutive diabetic admissions were reviewed, showed marked improvement in all areas of diabetic patient care.Objections to voluntary conformity by staff members were surprisingly absent. The institution of a diabetic service is recommended for all hospitals as a means of improving diabetic care.</AbstractText>"}

All the lipid fractions had a lognormal distribution. All were significantly higher than in the controls up to the seventh decade. An explanation for the declining serum lipid levels with age was found. Contrary to previous reports, there was no abnormality in the relation of various lipid fractions to one another in C.H.D. A spurious correlation between C/P ratio and total cholesterol was found in both groups. In separating coronary and control subjects, cholesterol and 0-12 lipoproteins were the most reliable criteria and were equal in this respect. The misclassification rises from 20% in the fourth to 33% in the seventh decade. C/P ratio offered no improvement. The triglyceride-containing 100-400 lipoprotein was an inferior discriminator. Employing all the lipid fractions, discriminant analysis provided a minimum 12% misclassification in the fourth decade. There was no demonstrable relationship of cholesterol to body measurements, physical activity or family history of C.H.D.</AbstractText>"}

A short 12-week study was conducted which incorporated a cross-over design and the results were examined by variance analysis after dosage was individualized to the patient's requirements. Greater stability of fasting blood sugar was found on tolazamide; patients also had less glycosuria and lower fasting blood sugar on tolazamide. Tolazamide appeared to be between five and six times as potent as tolbutamide, mg. for mg.No hepatic, renal, hematologic or symptomatic toxic reactions were observed during the total of 72 person-weeks of tolazamide therapy.</AbstractText>"}

Eighty-five patients proved to be diabetic, but 33 of these had no glycosuria on their first visit and would not have been detected by laboratory tests had the blood glucose levels not been measured. Exactly one-half of the new diabetics discovered would have been missed (15 of 30) had only urine tests been performed. The new diabetics who were aglycosuric at their initial examination had a mild form of the disease, were predominantly elderly, and were controlled, in nearly every case, by diet alone. Most of these patients had evidence of an elevated renal threshold for glucose. These results indicate that there is a large group of patients with mild, asymptomatic, diabetes mellitus who remain undetected unless blood tests are employed routinely. Because they have little or no glycosuria these patients do not have polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, or loss of weight. Automation in the medical laboratory has made routine blood tests for glucose feasible and rewarding in detecting diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

Hypoglycemic agents were not administered in the absence of frank diabetes. All patients were attended at delivery by interns or residents. Only two perinatal losses (1.5%) occurred in complicated cases, one of which might have been avoided. Perinatal losses in unrecognized prediabetics are largely due to associated obstetric factors, and in uncomplicated prediabetes should not differ from nondiabetic pregnancies. Recognition of the prediabetic state allows subsequent complications to be anticipated and treated early. In the absence of frank diabetes, hypoglycemic agents would not improve the immediate fetal salvage. Their value for reducing the incidence of recognized complications or in promoting the remote welfare of the fetus (preventing the ultimate development of diabetes) has not been established. The administration of hypoglycemic agents to the pregnant prediabetic is not recommended in view of the possible teratogenic effect.</AbstractText>"}

Mepyrapone (Metopiron), 500 mg. every four hours, was administered orally for 48 hours. The pituitary response was determined by the amount of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid in a 24-hour urine sample (by a modification by Peterson of the Porter-Silber method). Pituitary reserve was decreased in four patients who were pituitary dwarfs, one who had retarded growth, two patients with Sheehan's syndrome, three with pituitary tumours, one who had panhypopituitarism without a tumour, and one case of limited adrenal reserve (confirmed by a negative response to ACTH stimulation). The pituitary reserve was normal in three patients with gonadal dysgenesis, three who exhibited retarded growth, one case of diabetes insipidus, one cretin, one patient treated by steroids, three with psychogenic amenorrhea, and five normal controls. It is concluded that this test of pituitary reserve is useful in the assessment of children with growth retardation and in establishing the diagnosis of pituitary insufficiency in adults.</AbstractText>"}

(2) The action of these fat diets was corrected by the addition of methionine, thiouracil, or coconut oil, but there was no modification either by addition of choline or sulfonamide or by increase in the protein proportion. (3) In rats fed other high fat diets (olive oil, butter) the actions of alloxan were not modified, but there was a slight diminution when high oleomargarine or corn oil diets were fed. However, complete protection was observed when a high coconut oil diet was administered. (4) The unfavorable effect of the high lard diet was observed also on the initiation and evolution of diabetes due to subtotal pancreatectomy. Contrarily, feeding a high protein diet and especially treatment with thiouracil had a favorable effect. (5) Diabetes appeared first in subtotal pancreatectomized rats which were overfed, then in those which ate ad libitum, and finally in those which were underfed. Diabetes appeared in rats fed a single meal before it did in those eating the same amount of food divided into three meals.</AbstractText>"}

Fifty-nine animals which developed hyperglycemia (blood sugar levels above 150 mg. per cent) were observed for periods from 5 days to 32 weeks. Postmortem examination of the kidneys of these diabetic animals revealed glycogen deposition in the loops of Henle and convoluted tubules in 26 rats or 44 per cent. Glycogen could not be demonstrated in the glomeruli. Within the time limits of this experiment (32 weeks) no intercapillary glomerulosclerosis was observed. The following facts were revealed regarding glycogen nephrosis in alloxan diabetes: (a) Its appearance in the kidneys of the diabetic rats depended solely upon the terminal blood sugar levels of these animals. A value of 350 mg. per cent was the critical level, above which glycogen nephrosis was almost invariably demonstrable. With terminal levels below 300 mg. per cent no glycogen nephrosis was found. (b) No relationship existed between the postmortem finding of glycogen nephrosis and the initial blood sugar level, or the maximum height of the hyperglycemia attained by individual rats. (c) The results suggest that glycogen nephrosis is a reversible lesion.</AbstractText>"}

Positive results were associated with prolonged hyperglycemia. These findings add further evidence in support of the hypothesis that a sustained elevation of blood glucose may, under certain conditions, lead to the production of damage to the islands of Langerhans in this species. Besides hyperglycemia, other disturbances which might be responsible wholly or in part for the island lesions are under study.</AbstractText>"}

Such animals, moreover, show a rise in plasma inorganic phosphate and blood sugar. They also show in the liver a decrease in glycogen and in the total acid-soluble phosphates. An increase in liver inorganic phosphate occurs with a concurrent fall in adenosine pyrophosphate and other organo-phosphates. Hence the rise in plasma inorganic phosphate during coma is at least partially due to a loss of liver phosphate. It is probable that this rise in plasma inorganic phosphate results from a breakdown of organo-phosphates which result from the depressed oxidations associated with insulin lack. Insulin, when administered in exceptionally large doses, tends to cause improvement in both the clinical and chemical state of comatose rats.</AbstractText>"}

The administration of the posterior pituitary antidiuretic hormone by constant intravenous infusion has been used to examine the two characteristic actions of the hormone; namely, the facilitation of the active renal tubular reabsorption of water distally in the nephron and the inhibition of the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium proximally. 2. Experimental evidence was obtained which indicates that variations in the excretion of water and electrolyte involve the integration of these two actions with obscure variables which are discemible in the experimental data but are not subject to definition at this time. 3. Graded antidiuresis in the animal with diabetes insipidus, when normally hydrated, was only obtained in the range of 0.001 to 0.005 unit (pressor) per hour. This range of hormone administration was also found to be physiologically active in the normal animals. These observations together with others permit the placing of the normal rate of liberation of the antidiuretic hormone in a10 to 15 kilo dog in the range of 0.001 to 0.005 unit per hour.</AbstractText>"}

The pancreas from one animal was united by a vascular union with the neck blood vessels of another dog which had been pancreatectomized for 20 hours. The time necessary to reduce the blood sugar level to 120 mg. per cent was determined. 1. Pancreas from 6 hypophysectomized dogs produced a normal insulin secretion, showing that an anterior pituitary hormone is not necessary for its production or maintenance. 2. In 14 of 17 normal dogs given anterior pituitary extract for 3 or more consecutive days and presenting diabetes (fasting blood sugar 150 mg. per cent or more) the pancreas showed diminished insulin production. 3. In animals which remained diabetic after discontinuing the injections of hypophyseal extract, the pancreas islands were markedly pathologic and the insulin secretion was practically nil. 4. When hyperglycemia existed on the 2nd to 5th day but fell later, the insulin secretion of 5 dogs was normal in 2, supernormal in 1, and less than normal in 2. Histologic examination showed a restoration of beta cells. 5. In 14 dogs resistant to the diabetogenic action of anterior pituitary extract, as shown by little or no change in blood sugar, the pancreatic secretion of insulin was normal in 6 cases, supernormal in 3, and subnormal in 5 cases. Clear signs of hyperfunction of B cells were observed. In 6 resistant animals a high blood sugar (150 mg. per cent) appeared shortly before transplanting, but insulin secretion was normal in 4, supernormal in 1, and subnormal in 1 case. 6. With one injection of extract and 1 day of hyperglycemia the capacity of the pancreas to secrete insulin was not altered. 7. A high blood sugar level lasting 4 days does not alter the islets. The hypophyseal extract acts, therefore, by some other mechanism. In normal dogs, the continuous intravenous infusion of glucose for 4 days maintained the blood sugar at levels as high as those after pituitary extract. In these animals the B cells were hyperplastic and insulin secretion normal. 8. Anterior hypophyseal hyperglycemia is due at first to extrapancreatic factors which are the most important, and last only during the injections of extracts. Pancreatic factors appear afterwards and are responsible for permanent diabetes. Hypophyseal extract produces histological changes in many tissues and damages the Langerhans islands. The coexistent high blood sugar probably exhausts the B cells and exaggerates their injury. 9. In all cases there is a relation between the cytology of the islet B cells and the insulin secreting capacity.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":19992415,"Title":"Interactions of Fat and Carbohydrate Metabolism-New Aspects and Therapies: (Section of Therapeutics and Pharmacology).","Journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine","Date":"Nov 1941","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>NO one has so far produced anything approaching a clear picture of either fat or carbohydrate metabolism and the interactions of the two are still more involved and elusive although they clearly exist. Plants and animals build up reserves of fat from carbohydrate, but the reverse process (fat into carbohydrate), proved in plant seeds, is still unproven in animals, although theoretically possible.In normal human metabolism fat-carbohydrate interactions are almost hidden. The disturbances shown in the metabolism of a diabetic seem to give us the clearest indications of these interactions. Either carbohydrate or fat can be used as the main source of body fuel, but their metabolic course is very different, both as regards chemistry and function. It is only whep carbohydrate is not available, either in starvation or severe diabetes, that fat provides the fuel of the body; this contrast is also manifest in the blood and internal organs, especially the liver. Under the commonest normal conditions of diet carbohydrate is predominantly and preferentially used for metabolism. The liver is rich in glycogen, poor in fat; the blood fat is minimal and ketone bodies, although perhaps present in small amount in the blood at most times, are absent on common tests. As soon as carbohydrate is insufficiently available for the needs of metabolism, depot fat flows to the liver and is there catabolized to ketone bodies which recent proof has shown to be burned peripherally in the muscles independent of carbohydrate metabolism. This is a normal process, harmful only in diabetes, and especially harmful when it occurs suddenly, e.g. when insulin is cut off from a fat diabetic dog or human patient. A diabetic supports with ease a prolonged severe ketosis but suffers from one of sudden onset, although of milder severity. Insulin in the diabetic and sugar in the starved switches metabolism from fat to carbohydrate usage very quickly and ketonuria usually disappears in three to six hours.'Diabetic obesity' is very common and is often seen in the earliest stages and again after insulin treatment. It seems probable that hyperglycaemia causes this obesity and this has been clearly established by observations on an unusual case of lipaemia, diabetes and lipodystrophy.Lipaecmia may occur in two opposite phases of metabolism, one anabolic-when fat is on its way to storage, the other catabolic-when it is flowing from stores to the liver. The latter is the usual condition obvious in disease.Work has also been done which suggests that other lipotropic factors-choline, lipocaic, &amp;c., exert an influence on carbohydrate-fat balance, more specifically the glycogen-fat balance in the liver.In America attention has been drawn to the frequent and persistenzt occurrence of fatty enlargement of the liver in diabetic children. The author has seen many diabetic children (usually in a state of chronic ketosis) with enlarged livers, but such enlargement has rapidly disappeared with better management of the diabetes. Only two out of some 500 diabetic children have clearly shown the unmistakable syndrome of 'hepatomegalic dwarfism '. In these two cases choline and lipocaic were given over prolonged periods without any effect: the liver, however, of one of these cases has since become normal by the addition of zinc protamine insulin.</AbstractText>"}

When the pancreas is reduced to 4 gm. the capacity for secreting insulin under certain conditions of strain is diminished whereas a pancreas reduced to 10 gm. may have a normal or decreased capacity. This decreased functional capacity is shown: (1) by a longer hyperglycemic curve after the intravenous injection of 1 gm. of glucose per kilo; (2) by the requirement of smaller doses of extract of anterior hypophysis to produce diabetes; and (3) by the longer time required to correct the diabetic hyperglycemia if reduced pancreas is grafted in the neck of pancreatectomized animals. The time to recover is in inverse ratio to the weight of the transplanted pancreatic tissue.</AbstractText>"}

Three rather ill-defined types are described: (1) early alimentary glycosuria; (2) renal glycosuria; (3) late alimentary glycosuria. The changes in the concentration of glucose in the blood and urine of groups of pregnant women when starved and later fed with a known quantity of glucose are narrated and compared with the changes in the blood and urine of non-pregnant women treated in the same way. An attempt is made to assess the incidence of glycosuria among pregnant women living on an ordinary diet. Very different estimates by a number of authorities are referred to and are explained, in part at least, as due to the time, in relation to a meal, when a sample of urine is collected and examined. The character, the quality and amount of the meal, as well as the method of detecting the glucose affects the finding, for the glycosuria of pregnancy is frequently intermittent. The conclusion is arrived at that from 20 to 30 per cent. of women during some part of their pregnancy excrete appreciable quantities of glucose in their urine.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Part II Discusses the Relationship between Glycosuria and Vaginal Thrush and records the Examination and Treatment of a Small Number of Patients suffering from that Disease' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>Glycosuria is found to be present in all cases of vaginal thrush if suitable arrangements are made to collect and examine samples of urine. The avidity or predilection of <i>Oïdium albicans</i> for moist acid surfaces soiled with glucose is referred to. The possibility that the blastospores of that fungus, which are produced in enormous numbers in infected persons, may be dispersed in the air of hospital wards containing cases of vaginal thrush is commented upon.The examination of the blood and urine while the patient is starving and after a feed of 50 grams of glucose in a small series of cases of vaginal thrush is recorded. The treatment of four cases as examples is detailed.The general conclusion is arrived at, on the basis of the established facts, that a well-balanced diet, with adequate vitamin content, must be regarded as an essential part of the treatment of vaginal thrush, in addition to the local application of antiseptics such as gentian violet or iodine.Careful and frequent examinations of the urine for the presence of sugar in samples collected after the main meal of the day and during the later stages of the pregnancy, and the correction of errors of diet revealed in this way, are prophylactic measures against thrush infection of the vagina of pregnant women.</AbstractText>"}

It is suggested that such a condition exists in obese subjects with a carbohydrate intolerance.A high protein diet based on a study of these cases is brought forward.This diet has been shown to operate favourably in diabetic states. Many cases of reasonable severity can be brought to develop a normal or nearly normal glucose tolerance curve and retain this state over a period of years. Cases in this state are better able to resist concomitant infections without deterioration of their tolerance than cases imperfectly balanced with insulin.The high protein diet can be used in cases of hyperpiesia in the absence of gross kidney damage. These cases show a steady and lasting drop in blood-pressure without the necessity of employing rest.The value of the pure fruit diet in increasing tolerance of certain diabetics to carbohydrate is demonstrated.The indiscriminate use of insulin in hyperglycaemic states is deprecated on the grounds that it is frequently unnecessary, and though it may balance it does not necessarily rectify the main deficiency of carbohydrate intolerance.By the use of this simple high protein diet, where no weighing, &amp;c., is required, a large number of diabetics at present on insulin could be readily dealt with, a return to a normal or nearly normal glucose tolerance curve being obtained and maintained.</AbstractText>"}

The hypophysectomized cat shows an alleviation of the diabetes following pancreatectomy comparable to that previously demonstrated by others in the dog. 2. It is possible by various procedures to remove both adrenals and all the pancreas from cats. Such animals have survived for as long as 4 weeks without the use of insulin, the average survival being 18 days. Daily injections of cortical extract are necessary. By contrast, cats deprived of insulin by similar procedures but with adrenals intact survive only 4-5 days. 3. Adrenalectomized-depancreatized cats show as striking an alleviation of the diabetes as do those hypophysectomized and depancreatized. This is expressed by the markedly decreased glucose, nitrogen and acetone body excretion compared to that found in the depancreatized cat, as well as by the increased survival period. 4. Removal of epinephrine by denervation or demedullation of the adrenals does not protect against pancreatic diabetes in the cat. 5. The carbohydrate tolerance of depancreatized cats is not significantly increased by hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. The exceptions to this finding have all been in animals presenting varying degrees of spontaneous hypoglycemia. 6. It is our opinion that the effects of hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy upon pancreatic diabetes are due to diminution of the production of glucose and acetone bodies rather than to the resumption of normal carbohydrate utilization.</AbstractText>"}

NORMAL, INFECTION AND INTOXICATION.","Journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","Date":"Mar 31 1933","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Human liver tissue has been assayed to determine the concentration of hemoglobin production factors in normal and abnormal states. Standardized dogs made anemic by bleeding have been used in this biological assay and the human liver tissue compared with control animal tissue. Normal human liver tissue (external trauma) contains much more of these hemoglobin production factors than the normal control animal liver-the ratio being 162 to 100. In this form of biological assay 42 gm. of animal liver or 26 gm. of human liver represent 1 gm. of potential hemoglobin. A second group (Table 2) in which the viscera were practically normal except for atrophy, the cases presenting a good deal of arteriosclerosis and senile changes, shows a lower content of these hemoglobin production factors. The ratio of human to control here is 117 to 100. This is certainly the low limit of normal. Acute fulminant infections reduce somewhat the store of these potent hemoglobin production factors in the human liver (Table 3). The average value is 117 as compared with 100 control but the more acute cases show the lower values. Chronic intoxications show values which are close to the human normal-151 per cent. The liver content of hemoglobin producing factors shows very wide fluctuations in cases of thyrotoxicosis. Diabetes may be associated with rather low values. There may be complete dissociation of the organic iron content and the concentration of hemoglobin production factors in the liver.</AbstractText>"}

The case differed from typical diabetes in the following respects. In spite of severe thirst and polyuria, lasting untreated for six years, the patient became very fat, and the condition did not progress in the usual way. At the termination of the last pregnancy the glycosuria disappeared and the blood-sugar became almost normal, although the diet was very little restricted and all insulin was omitted. Insulin had only a small hypoglycaemic effect and the blood-sugar curves after glucose were atypical. The fasting level was raised, but the blood-sugar returned to the initial figure in two hours, suggesting that sugar was being well tolerated in spite of the hyperglycaemia. A very severe ketosis and a lowered threshold for glucose were present during the last three months of the pregnancy and disappeared immediately after labour. At labour, extreme hydramnios was obvious, and a very large foetus weighing 12 lb. 6 oz. was stillborn. On the fourth day after the labour 10 units of pituitary extract (1 c.c. pituitrin) produced an epileptiform attack and nearly killed the patient. There was a temporary return of the glycosuria, without hyperglycaemia, and a transient ketosis. The belief that the pituitary is or was involved is supported by the patient's history that her head had grown larger, and by the definite constriction of the temporal fields of vision in both eyes.It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism was not due to disease of the pancreas causing a deficient production of endogenous insulin, but to the antagonistic influence of a hyperactive pituitary gland associated with repeated pregnancies.</AbstractText>"}

VARIOUS FAILURES OF DIETETIC TREATMENT, AND THEIR CAUSES.","Journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","Date":"Apr 30 1920","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. Practically every detail of clinical diabetes can be reproduced in partially depancreatized animals. The resemblance is made still more exact by the susceptibility of such dogs to acidosis and coma, as will be shown in later papers, and also by the similarity of the anatomic changes in the islands of Langerhans. These animals are therefore useful test objects for a therapeutic investigation. 2. These animals at first show considerable tendency to regain assimilation, comparable to that in the early stages of most human cases of diabetes; and in some instances they recover so as to be able to endure any degree or duration of carbohydrate feeding and can be made diabetic only by removal of additional pancreatic tissue. Similar recovery in some human cases, especially after acute pancreatitis, is a probability. This recuperative tendency can be negatived by overfeeding, even without glycosuria. With duration of the diabetes the power of recuperation diminishes and practically disappears in dogs as in human patients. 3. In the absence of progressive pancreatitis or other extraneous causes, these dogs show no inherent downward tendency in their assimilation. This conclusion rests upon observations as long as 6 years from the first pancreas operation and 3 years of known diabetes. This absence of inherent progressiveness is what should naturally be expected in animals with simple resection of part of an organ, and serves further to fit them for accurate feeding experiments. 4. Every detail of the downward progress of human patients on various diets is reproduced in such animals. They lose assimilation and die most rapidly on diets rich in carbohydrate, and less rapidly on excess of other foods. The differences between sugar and starch, and between starch and protein, seem to be only those of degree and time rather than anything absolute. The important point is that, granting the absence of spontaneous downward tendencies as stated, all the different kinds and degrees of downward progress in the records of animals in this and the preceding paper are purely the results of overstrain of the internal pancreatic function by excess of food. 5. Varying degrees of success and failure in the dietetic control of diabetes are also illustrated. The benefit of the classical treatment by exclusion of preformed carbohydrate and limitation of protein is confirmed, in the prolongation of life and well-being to some extent in nearly all cases and perhaps indefinitely in some of the mildest cases. In the great majority of cases such a therapeutic result is not permanent, and downward progress is finally observed if the observations are continued long enough. In most of these cases life, strength, and assimilation can be preserved for a much longer time by a degree of undernutrition suited to the severity of the diabetes, and accomplished by limitation of fat in the diet. The permanence of such control is supported by the unimpaired or rising assimilation in experiments of 1 to 1(3/4) years duration, but still longer observations would be desirable. Diabetes of great severity is controllable only by correspondingly radical undernutrition. In still more severe cases glycosuria can be abolished only by a degree of undernutrition which entails final death from inanition. In the most severe cases glycosuria cannot be stopped, evidently because the assimilative power is too low to dispose of even the minimum supply of food materials; namely, that derived from the body stores in fasting. 6. A claim of saving every patient, no matter how near death, would be a preposterous one for any remedy in any disease, and the animal experiments do not support such a claim for diabetes. Also it is unreasonable to expect the actual cure of an organic deficiency by diet, and the diet treatment in animals just as in patients generally represents the sparing rather than the restoration of the weakened function. The basis of the belief in the inherently progressive tendency of severe cases of clinical diabetes is shaken by the exact reproduction of such case histories by diet in animals which are free from spontaneous downward tendencies; but there is still lack of a sufficient number of patients treated on the principle of relief of the total metabolic burden to demonstrate the absence of such inherent progressiveness in human diabetes. As described elsewhere, the principle mentioned has given encouraging results in proportion as it has received actual application in practice. The clinical problem requires the same prolonged careful control of all discoverable symptoms as in animals, and cases too severe for such control, or complicated with infections, violations of diet, etc., are on the same plane as animals in which a similar condition has been produced. Some proportion of cases, especially in young persons, will be found suitable for accurate determination of the question of whether all or most cases of severe diabetes are inevitably progressive and hopeless, and the writer looks forward to publishing such a series. Irrespective of the outcome, the raising of this question is justified by its importance. On the theoretical side, it involves both the general prognosis and the nature of the process underlying diabetes. On the practical side, it is already established that diet is at least the chief cause of downward progress, and it is important to eliminate this cause by avoiding the dietary injuries illustrated in the animal experiments.</AbstractText>"}

The feces may be collected after purgation and the phthalein extracted and estimated against a standard solution. The estimation of phthalein can be done with accuracy in a suitable colorimeter and the elimination in normal dogs is quite constant. Given a definite liver injury by means of poisons (chloroform, phosphorus), the amount of phthalein excreted will be diminished and the fall in output will be proportional to the amount of injury. With an acute fatal poisoning the curve may fall to zero. Under certain conditions of vascular interference the liver phthalein may show a decreased output; in passive congestion of the liver and with the Eck fistula the liver output may fall considerably below normal. Known disturbances of the liver function due to parenchymatous injury or vascular disturbances are indicated by a fall in the phthalein. excretion curve. Conversely it may be claimed that a drop in phthalein excretion may indicate a decrease in the functional capacity of the liver even if there be no detectable histological changes. Adrenal insufficiency produced by extirpation of three fourths or more of the gland tissue will be associated with a drop in liver phthalein excretion. With hypertrophy of the adrenal fragment the excretion comes back to normal, but may fall again when more adrenal tissue is removed (text-figure 1). Pancreatic insufficiency causes a progressive fall in the phthalein excretion indicating a grave lowering of the functional capacity of the liver (text-figure 2). This fact has a direct bearing on the question of diabetes. Parathyroid insufficiency with tetany causes no decrease in phthalein output, but at times a rise above normal. This comes out best when the phthalein curve is low following pancreas extirpation. Parathyroid tetany may cause hyperactivity on the part of the liver cells. Thyroid insufficiency produces no change in the uniform curve of phthalein excretion. Hypophysis insufficiency shows an initial fall in the curve, followed by a return to normal and a final drop in the last few days before death. These experiments supply evidence to the effect that the liver is very much concerned in the derangement that follows the removal of the ductless glands. Hence it seems probable that this disturbance of the liver function may be an important factor in the general symptom complex of ductless gland insufficiency. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation to Dr. S. J. Crowe and Dr. A. P. Jones for assistance rendered in performing some of the operations for gland removal.</AbstractText>"}

As in our hands the chemical colorimetric method has proved more accurate, these values rather than the physiological values will be given in the final analysis. The two adrenal glands in the same individual as a rule contain about the same amount of adrenalin per gram, but variations of 10 to 20 per cent. are not unusual. Normal dogs show an index which may vary from 1.2 to 1.8 milligrams. The dogs were killed by short ether anesthesia and bleeding from the carotid. Normal human beings, dying from trauma, rupture of aneurysm, etc., show an index of 0.35 to 0.50 of a milligram, when autopsy takes place a few hours after death. Deterioration of uncut glands or of a gland hash kept on ice in the dark is not rapid and rarely exceeds 10 per cent. in twenty-four hours. Acute intoxication in dogs shows a low adrenalin index, especially the intoxication associated with intestinal obstruction and the closed intestinal loop. Intravenous injection of the poison found in closed duodenal loops sufficient to cause fatal shock causes a great drop in the adrenalin index, at times to one fourth normal or even lower. After recovery from a sublethal toxic dose the adrenalin index may rise rapidly to a point considerably above normal. The same may hold for recovery after chloroform poisoning. Anesthesia by chloroform or ether causes a drop in the adrenalin index depending upon the length of anesthesia and probably in part on the depth of anesthesia. Liver poisons (chloroform, phosphorus, hydrazine) cause a drop in the adrenal index to a low level, perhaps one half normal in acute cases. Pancreas extirpation with prolonged glycosuria and death produces a great drop in the adrenalin index (cat). There is evidence that this may hold in some cases of human diabetes. In man disease of one adrenal (tuberculosis) may be associated with an adrenalin index of double the normal value in the intact adrenal. Pernicious anemia is the only disease so far found to present an abnormally high adrenalin index, and the single case shows an index at least twice normal. This is of interest especially in relation to the views recently put forward to indicate that the spleen and adrenal may be concerned in the lipoid metabolism which is thought to be profoundly disturbed in this disease. Secondary anemia due to repeated hemorrhage or the intoxication of cancer or tuberculosis causes a fall in the adrenalin index. Cachexia due to neoplasm or tuberculosis may cause a marked fall in the adrenalin index, perhaps to less than one half of normal. Acute infections (typhoid fever), septicemia, peritonitis, and similar conditions may be associated with a normal adrenalin index or one somewhat below normal. Diseases of the kidneys, heart, or blood vessels associated with elevated blood pressure show no constant variation in the adrenalin index, which may be normal or slightly subnormal.</AbstractText>"}

It was found that in certain diseases the globulin fraction is markedly increased, whereas the total protein of the serum may be normal, or may fall far below normal in amount. The diseases in which an increase in the globulins takes place may be grouped as follows: (1) cardiac diseases associated with decompensation and serous effusions, (2) pulmonary or respiratory affections of inflammatory or non-inflammatory origin (pneumonia, emphysema, polycythemia), (3) diabetes mellitus, and (4) parenchymatous nephritis. In the serum of chronic parenchymatous nephritis the increase in the globulin content is most pronounced and may constitute nearly all the protein, or as much as 95 per cent. The globulin content of serum is normal or diminished in the following diseases: (1) simple achylia gastrica (short duration), (2) tuberculosis, (3) diabetes insipidus, and (4) chronic interstitial nephritis. Other ingredients of the sera analyzed showed variations which cannot be definitely classified; but in a general way it appears upon careful analysis that an accumulation of water and salt occurs in those diseases in which the globulin fraction of the blood serum is increased.</AbstractText>"}

Hypertrophy of the islands of Langerhans occurs in two forms: (1) the simple type which is nothing more than an increase in size of preexisting islands; and (2) the columnar type, in which the islands are composed of anastomosing columns of cylindrical cells. 2. Regeneration of the islands of Langerhans takes place by means of a budding off of columnar cells from the ducts. The process is analogous to the development of the islands in the fetal pancreas. 3. Newly formed islands of Langerhans are composed of cylindrical cells similar in all respects to those constituting hypertrophied islands of the columnar type. The two structures are identical, the latter being a later phase of the former. 4. Newly formed islands of Langerhans are capable of a greater hypertrophy than preëxisting islands. Both types of insular hypertrophy are usually of a compensatory character, the columnar, or regenerative type, being the more important. 5. Hypertrophy and regeneration of the islands of Langerhans occur most frequently in diabetes mellitus (34 per cent. of 100 cases studied). These changes are usually associated with sclerosis or hyaline degeneration of other islands. 6. Hypertrophy and regeneration of the islands of Langerhans are occasionally observed in cirrhosis and carcinoma of the pancreas. In some of the most advanced cases, however, the islands have been spared and neither hypertrophy nor regeneration are present. 7. Regeneration of the islands of Langerhans has been noted in five cases in which there was no evidence of diabetes and where the pancreas was for the most part normal. In four of these cases, columnar hypertrophy of the islands was also observed. All five cases were associated with abnormalities of the larger ducts-obstruction, chronic inflammation, and adenomatous proliferation of the lining epithelium. 8. The occurrence of hypertrophy and regeneration of the islands of Langerhans affords considerable evidence in favor of their anatomic and functional independence.</AbstractText>"}

Intraperitoneal injections of adrenalin into animals which are completely under the influence of phlorhizin and which are free from glycogen do not result in any extra elimination of sugar. This proves that adrenalin does not cause a conversion of fat into carbohydrates, as is maintained by Blum and by Eppinger, Falta and Rudinger. II. The high D:N ratio 5.2 and 6.1 reported by Eppinger, Falta and Rudinger after adrenalin injections in depancreatized dogs, which were obtained after short periods of six hours and four hours respectively, can be explained by the elimination of carbohydrates present in the organism. III. These results confirm the work of Straub and Ritzmann which indicates that adrenalin, by its constricting effect on the blood vessels, produces anemia of the tissues, resulting in imperfect oxidation, and this anemia is followed by the conversion of glycogen into dextrose by hyperglycemia and consequently by glycosuria.</AbstractText>"}

Anatomical lesions of the pancreas occur in more than seven-eighths of all cases of diabetes mellitus. 2. In diabetes associated with lesions of the pancreas, the islands of Langerhans constantly show pathological changes (sclerosis, hyaline degeneration, infiltration with leucocytes and hypertrophy). 3. In some cases of pancreatic diabetes (twelve of ninety cases) the lesion of the pancreas is limited to the islands of Langerhans. 4. In sixteen cases of diabetes associated with hyaline degeneration of the islands of Langerhans the average duration of the disease has been three and a half years; in forty-six cases with sclerosis of these bodies, three years and eleven months. In six cases of diabetes associated with an infiltration of leucocytes about the islands of Langerhans the average duration has been eleven months. 5. Destructive lesions of the islands of Langerhans may be associated with compensatory hypertrophy of other interacinar islands. 6. Peculiar adenoma-like hypertrophy of the islands of Langerhans occurs in a small proportion of cases (seven of ninety) and may be associated with adenomata of the thyroid gland (two cases) and of the pituitary body (one case). 7. Diabetes mellitus occurring in association with haemochromatosis (bronzed diabetes) is referable to pigmentation and destruction of the islands of Langerhans. 8. The pancreas is found to exhibit no pathological changes in twelve per cent. of cases. In approximately one-half of these cases it has been noted that the size of the gland or the number of islands is much less than normal. 9. Fifty per cent. of cases of diabetes mellitus occurring before the age of thirty years are associated with lesions of the pancreas; seventy-five per cent. of all cases of diabetes in which the pancreas is normal occur before the age of thirty years. Ninety-seven per cent. of cases of diabetes occurring after the age of thirty years are associated with lesions of the pancreas; and eighty-six per cent. occur in association with chronic interacinar pancreatitis accompanying arteriosclerosis. 10. Interacinar pancreatitis which occurs in seventy-three per cent. of all cases of diabetes is almost constantly associated with arteriosclerosis: gangrene of the extremities, which occurs with one-fourth of all cases of interacinar pancreatitis, is doubtless referable to the same cause. 11. Chronic interlobular pancreatitis, when associated with diabetes, is accompanied by sclerosis or hyaline degeneration of the islands of Langerhans. 12. Diabetes in association with myxoedema or with exophthalmic goiter may be referable to a lesion of the pancreas, namely, chronic interacinar inflammation with sclerosis of the islands of Langerhans; diabetes in association with acromegaly may be referable to a lesion of the islands of Langerhans, namely, sclerosis and hyaline degeneration with adenoma-like hypertrophy.</AbstractText>"}

In work along this line it is most important to have a simple method of determining the catalytic activity of tissues. The method must be such that several observations can be made during a single experiment, so that a better idea can be obtained of the velocity of the reaction at various intervals. 2. The catalytic activity of human tissues varies greatly in diseases. A. Nephritis.-The kidney always shows the most marked reduction although the other tissues examined, blood, lung, liver, spleen, likewise show decrease in their power of decomposing hydrogen peroxide. This reduction varies directly with the severity of the pathological lesion in the kidney and the clinical symptoms. The urine also in cases of nephritis shows a much greater inhibiting power than normal urine. This may be accounted for by the reaction of the urine, and subsequent work must prove whether or not the kidney takes any more active part in nephritis and secretes into the blood and urine a substance which manifests itself by a reduction in the catalytic activity. B. The catalytic activity of the blood in the two cases of eclampsia which we have studied was not reduced. This is the most important fact we have so far obtained, if it can be substantiated, since it can furnish us with a ready ante-mortem means of differentiating eclampsia and nephritis. C.Pneumonia.-The lung in the stage of red hepatization has an increased catalytic activity. This increase varies directly with the number of intact red blood cells in the exudate, and in the engorged capillaries. Strength is given to this conclusion by the fact, that on the one hand, there is no increased activity in gray hepatization, while on the other hand, there is an enormously increased activity in the fresh hemorrhagic infarct. D. Tuberculosis.-The decreased activity of the lung in tuberculosis is probably due, for the most part, to the lack of blood in the diseased area, while the lowered activity which is present in the other organs is to be explained by the anaemia and emaciation which accompanies the process. Whether there is a specific catalytic inhibiting substance generated by the process, has not been determined. E. There was no reduction of the catalytic activity in the cases of diabetes mellitus and jaundice studied. F. In the one case of asphyxiation by illuminating gas, there was decided decrease in the catalytic activity of the blood. G. The tissues in the one case of congenital syphilis showed a marked lowering of the catalytic activity. 3. There is a slight decrease in the catalytic activity of the tissues due to post-mortem change, but this is so slight that it is hardly to be taken into consideration in the interpretation of the results obtained. 4. There is no marked change in the catalytic activity due to age. In concluding, we wish to thank Dr. A. S. Loevenhart, at whose suggestion this enzyme was studied, for the unfailing interest with which he has followed the progress of this work, and for the many valuable suggestions he has given us.</AbstractText>"}

A careful balancing of the normal acids and bases of the urine makes it possible not merely to detect the presence of organic acids in the urine, but also to determine approximately the amount of such acids. The method recently described by Herter and Wakeman can be recommended as securing a greater degree of accuracy, for the amount of labor involved, than any other procedure. 2. The determination of the N of NH(3) is a useful procedure for clinical purposes, since it is probably true that a considerable excretion of organic acid (say 15 gm. oxybutyric or more in 24 hours) is always attended by an increased excretion of NH(3). As much organic acid as corresponds to 10 gm. oxybutyric acid may be excreted in 24 hours without causing an increased excretion of NH(3) (Case IX). We cannot therefore rely on the ammonia output to detect moderate quantities of organic acid. 3. Where organic acids are removed in considerable amount without increasing the excretion of NH(3), the acid takes out other alkalies, probably in some instances chiefly K. 4. In cases of diabetic coma the urine always contains a large excess of organic acids and the N of NH(3) is usually increased to 18 to 25 per cent of the total N. 5. Crotonic acid can regularly be obtained from the urines of patients in diabetic coma. 6. The condition of diabetic coma is preceded by a period of days, weeks or months, in which there is a large excretion of beta-oxybutyric acid (20 gm. or more in 24 hours), and in which the N of NH(3) is largely increased. 7. Patients whose urines show or have shown a large excretion of organic acids are in danger of developing diabetic coma, but the N of NH(3) may temporarily rise as high as 16 per cent and yet coma may be delayed for more than 7 months (Case VII). The persistent excretion of more than 25 gm. of beta-oxybutyric acid indicates impending coma. 8. A patient passing 30 gm. of beta-oxybutyric acid in 24 hours may still have enough energy and strength to be about all day and perform considerable muscular work (Case X). 9. A patient who has been excreting very little organic acid and has gained weight may within a few months show the presence of considerable quantities of organic acid, and die in typical diabetic coma (Case VII). 10. When the urine contains little or no organic acid there is no immediate prospect of diabetic coma, but patients with such urine are probably liable to most of the other dangers that threaten diabetic patients. The relation between the degree of acid intoxication and the susceptibility to infection seems worthy of special experimental study. 11. Where the urine regularly contains more than 200 gm. of sugar per day there is usually considerable organic acid in the urine and large amounts of acid, indicative of coma, are invariably accompanied by considerable or great glycosuria. 12. Sometimes there is much sugar and little or no acid in the urine, and sometimes there is considerable acid and little sugar. These facts render it desirable to examine the urine of diabetic patients at least once a month with reference to the amount of acid excreted, for the element of acid intoxication must be clearly separated from the element of glycosuria in our study of the progress of a case. In other words, we must recognize the acid intoxication as an important and sometimes as a dominant factor in the prognosis, and this element should be regarded even in those cases of diabetes which have the clinical indications of a mild type of the disease. We may thus hope to prolong life in many instances by taking precautions, as to diet and out-of-door life, which might not otherwise be deemed necessary. 13. The withdrawal of carbohydrate food frequently leads to a considerable reduction in the quantity of organic acids excreted. The reason for this is not yet clear and the phenomenon deserves careful study.</AbstractText>"}

Embedded in the stroma, but not invaded by it, the latter maintain their continuity with the small ducts and acini with which they have a common origin. (2) Two types of chronic interstitial inflammation affecting the developed pancreas are distinguishable: (a) Interlobular Pancreatitis.-In the interlobular variety the inflammatory process is localized chiefly at the periphery of the lobule and implicates the islands of Langerhans only when the sclerotic process has reached a very advanced grade. When pancreatitis has followed obstruction of the ducts, the islands long remain unaltered though embedded in dense scar-like tissue. (b) Interacinar Pancreatitis.-In the interacinar type the process is diffuse, invading the lobules and separating individual acini. The inflammatory change invades the islands of Langerhans. (3) A relationship has been observed between lesions of the islands of Langerhans and the occurrence of diabetes mellitus. (a) In one of eleven cases of interlobular panereatitis diabetes of mild intensity occurred. The sclerosis, which in this case followed obstruction of the ducts by calculi, was far advanced and affected the islands of Langerhans. (b) In two of three cases of interacinar pancreatitis, diabetes was present. The third case was associated with a condition, haemochromatosis, which at a later stage is associated with diabetes, the result of pancreatic lesion. (c) In a fourth case of diabetes, hyaline deposit between the capillaries and the parenchymatous cells had so completely altered the islands of Langerhans that they were no longer recognizable.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":14778912,"Title":"The effect of alloxan diabetes on experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in the rabbit. III. The mechanism of the inhibition of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in alloxan-diabetic rabbits.","Journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","Date":"Oct 01 1950","Keywords":"ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, DIABETES MELLITUS","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A study of the serum lipids in normal and alloxan-diabetic rabbits during the course of cholesterol feeding is presented, particular attention being paid to the factors considered to be responsible for the stability of the serum lipids; namely, (1) their interrelations and (2) their association with the serum proteins. As far as the interrelations of the lipids were concerned a definite correlation was found between the development of atherosclerosis and an increase of serum cholesterol that was out of all proportion to the increase of serum lipid phosphorus and neutral fat. When these last two lipid constituents rose almost parallel with the serum cholesterol (as they did in some alloxan-diabetic rabbits), then the development of atherosclerosis was inhibited. This correlation was independent of the diabetic state, per se. It appeared likely that the marked elevation of serum neutral fat and lipid phosphorus in the diabetic animals was due to mobilization of body fat because of the disturbed carbohydrate metabolism. Because of their hydrophilic and emulsifying properties, it was thought probable that the elevation of the phospholipids was the important factor responsible for the stability of serum cholesterol. That neutral fat played a role, however, could not be denied. In normal rabbit sera, as we have previously shown, only small proportions of the lipid phosphorus and cholesterol are 'readily extractable' (i.e., unattached or only loosely attached to protein). On the other hand, in every case in which the serum lipids were elevated, the greater proportion of the lipid phosphorus and cholesterol was 'readily extractable,' irrespective of whether atherosclerosis developed or was inhibited. Analysis of the lipid content of the aorta of rabbits not fed cholesterol, whether diabetic or non-diabetic, and from alloxan-diabetic rabbits fed cholesterol but protected from the development of atherosclerosis, showed that there was no significant difference in lipid content or composition among the animals of these groups. When atherosclerosis developed following cholesterol feeding, the lipid composition of the aortas was essentially the same in both control and diabetic animals. The deposited lipid consisted predominantly of cholesterol with small and fairly constant proportions of other lipids that did not vary significantly regardless of the quantities of these other lipids present in the circulating blood. In the less severe lesions the proportion of ester cholesterol was greater than that of free cholesterol, but in advanced lesions the reverse was true. The following conclusions are drawn concerning the pathogenesis of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in the rabbit: 1. Instability of cholesterol in the blood rather than hypercholesterolemia, per se, is the general condition responsible for the deposition of this substance in the arterial walls. 2. Of the two factors considered to be responsible for the stability of the lipids in the blood, the interrelations of the lipids appear to be more important than their relation to the serum proteins, at least in so far as the development of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis is concerned. The importance of these conclusions in relation to the pathogenesis of human atherosclerosis is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

In the first 30 patients treated, a favorable degree of control of the alcoholism has been effected in approximately 80 per cent. When taken regularly the drug maintains in the patient a very high degree of sensitivity to alcohol, quickly producing a number of very distressing bodily reactions whenever even very small amounts of spirits are ingested. Because of its potential dangers, antabus should be used only after thorough clinical and laboratory studies in properly staffed institutions. It is contraindicated in individuals with existing major psychosis or drug addiction and must be used only with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, goiter, pregnancy, epilepsy, asthma, and hepatic disease. Antabus therapy should be considered only one aspect of the total treatment program for the alcoholic patient.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetes is a disease of total metabolism and not related solely to carbohydrate. In the preinsulin era many facts concerned in the regulation of diabetes were established scientifically-facts such as that regulation of the body mass and control of obesity are important, that damage is caused by over-restriction of carbohydrate intake, and that hyperglycemia activates diabetes. Many failures in the treatment today are owing to insufficient attention to these basic factors. Good control requires an effort to keep hyperglycemia and glycosuria at a minimum.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":15410140,"Title":"Chronic relapsing pancreatitis.","Journal":"California medicine","Date":"Mar 1950","Keywords":"PANCREATITIS","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Chronic relapsing pancreatitis is a disease of recurring acute episodes of severe upper abdominal pain which are progressive and gradually may become so severe and so frequent as to be intractable. Early in the disease the function of the gland and of the islet tissue may be disturbed only at the time of the acute attack, but subsequently these changes may become permanent and manifested by steatorrhea, creatorrhea and diabetes mellitus. The results of studies of pancreatic function parallel those of the pathologic process, and calcification of the pancreas is common. Medical treatment is generally disappointing. Paravertebral injections may control acute pain. Surgical therapy is none too satisfactory. Long continued biliary drainage, anastomosis between the common bile duct and duodenum and between the pancreatic duct and duodenum, section of the sphincter of Oddi, partial and total pancreatectomy and sympathectomy, splanchnicectomy and vagotomy have been helpful in relieving pain and in preventing the recurrence of attacks in some instances.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":15397539,"Title":"A multiphasic screening survey in San Jose.","Journal":"California medicine","Date":"Dec 1949","Keywords":"BLOOD, THORAX, URINE","Abstract":"<AbstractText>In the interest of economy and of better service to the persons examined, three screening tests of a kind usually made separately were combined and applied in a single examination of 945 employees in four industrial establishments. Miniature x-ray films of the chest were taken, blood specimens drawn and urine samples obtained so that studies and tests might be made to determine the presence of pulmonary or cardiac disease, syphilis, kidney disease, or diabetes. The history of each person examined was taken. Through this multiphasic survey, 13 cases of significant disease previously unknown to the patient were discovered. Sixteen cases of significant disease, previously known, were also disclosed; and in several such cases treatment was begun or resumed. The results in case finding were considerably greater than those of the customary screening for a single disease.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":13009517,"Title":"Screening tests for diabetes detection; combined with a chest x-ray survey.","Journal":"California medicine","Date":"Jan 1953","Keywords":"DIABETES MELLITUS/prevention and control","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A program was carried out to test the value and feasibility of performing blood sugar screening tests in conjunction with a community-wide chest x-ray survey. A simple, rapid and inexpensive blood sugar screening test requiring only about two drops of blood from the finger tip was used. Among 14,681 persons who stated that they did not have diabetes, 191 or 1.3 per cent had 'positive' results in screening tests. The number of persons referred to their physicians for diagnostic study because of the possibility of diabetes was reduced from 191 to 127 by means of a more specific secondary screening test. Diagnostic information with regard to 102 of the 127 persons referred to their physicians was supplied by the physicians. In 58 (0.40 per cent of the 14,681 participants) the diagnosis was diabetes-newly discovered as a result of referral by the survey.Some of the persons referred to their physicians because of suspicion of diabetes, while not then diabetic, might be considered prediabetic. The appearance of diabetes in this group during the year following the survey was therefore investigated. Glucose tolerance tests were performed for 32 of the diabetes suspects whose diagnosis immediately following the survey was either 'not diabetic' or unknown. In 15 cases the glucose tolerance curves were indicative of diabetes, in seven cases questionable and in ten cases normal. The 58 persons diagnosed immediately after the survey plus the 15 found to have 'diabetic' glucose tolerance curves a year later made a total of 73 newly discovered diabetics. This is a discovery rate of 0.50 per cent among the 14,681 participants in the survey. The success of this combined diabetes detection and chest x-ray survey suggests that other screening procedures should be studied to determine the desirability of adding them to similar community-wide case-finding programs.</AbstractText>"}

University of Minnesota. Hospitals","Date":"Oct 14 1949","Keywords":"ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE/therapeutic use, HYPOGLYCEMIA/drug therapy, HYPOGLYCEMIA/metabolism","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The effects of ACTH on the fasting blood sugar level and glucose tolerance test; on the potassium and inorganic phosphorus content of the serum; on the nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride, sodium and potassium balances; on the urinary excretion of uric acid, creatinine and adrenal corticosteroids and on the blood eosinophil counts were determined in five young children with non-Addisonian (familial) hypoglycemia. The type of response to ACTH was similar in all respects of the normal adult. However, under the conditions of our experiment, instead of producing a transient state of diabetes mellitus, as it does in the normal subject, the ACTH appeared merely to reverse the hypoglycemic tendency, with return of the fasting blood sugar levels and the glucose tolerance curve to normal. While the eosinophil count returned to normal promptly upon withdrawal of ACTH, the blood sugar remained above the threshold for hypoglycemic reactions for at least 10 days without ACTH in the most severe case in the series. (Figure 2) The same tendency was seen in the other four cases as well. In all instances, however, the original degree of hypoglycemia recurred at varying periods following withdrawal of the ACTH. After this had occurred in B.G., the hormone was again given intensively for two days, again raising the blood sugar to normal values. Administration of between 10 and 18 mg. of ACTH in one dose every forty-eight hours since that time (five months) has served to maintain this one-year-old patient in an essentially non-hypoglycemic state. Results of the study suggest, therefore, that ACTH may prove to be as effective in the control of chronic non-Addisonian hypoglycemosis as insulin is in the control of diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":13009503,"Title":"New vistas in psychosomatic medicine.","Journal":"California medicine","Date":"Dec 1952","Keywords":"MEDICINE, PSYCHOSOMATIC","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Further understanding in the field of psychosomatic medicine has come to light recently as the result of new approaches and methods of research. Such diseases as hypertension, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, peptic ulcer, diabetes and cardiovascular dysfunction may represent the body's method of adapting to chronic stress, according to Selye's concept of the general adaptation syndrome, with the phases of alarm, resistance and exhaustion. It has been postulated that unconscious dynamics of which patients are unaware are crucial in the understanding and interpretation of physiological research and therapy of patients with psychosomatic disorders. The concept of partial regression was applicable to patients with psychosomatic illness who were highly successful in social, economic and professional spheres. The illness was viewed as a protection against psychological regression by limited somatic regression. Pilot studies suggested that patients seriously ill with such disorders as ulcerative colitis and asthma responded favorably to enforced psychological regression and exploitation of dependency by excessive coddling, babying and mothering by an 'all-giving' physician in a hospital setting. Good physician-patient relationship remains the keystone in therapy and is the common denominator to many so-called successful modes of treatment.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":18129862,"Title":"The effect of alloxan diabetes on experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in the rabbit.","Journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","Date":"Jun 01 1949","Keywords":"ARTERIOSCLEROSIS/experimental, DIABETES MELLITUS/experimental","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A comparison was made of the effects of cholesterol feeding in normal rabbits and in rabbits rendered persistently diabetic by means of alloxan. In the two groups of animals hypercholesterolemia of comparable degree was induced by the feeding procedure. Nevertheless, the severity of the atherosclerosis of the aorta produced in the diabetic rabbits was much less than in the non-diabetic control animals. Indeed, a large proportion of the diabetic animals presented no atherosclerosis whatever. There was a similar inhibition of the deposit of lipid substances in the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands of the diabetic rabbits. The inhibition of the development of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis which was associated with the presence of alloxan diabetes was independent of the administration of alloxan per se. It was not dependent on the sex or weight of the animal, nor upon the daily dosage of cholesterol, the form in which it was administered, nor the duration of cholesterol feeding. It was also independent of changes in body weight occurring during the course of our experiments and of the actual degree of hypercholesterolemia induced by the administration of cholesterol. In addition, there was no gross or histological evidence of a morphological basis for the inhibitory effect either in the aorta or in the other organs in which it was observed. Only two factors were observed to be consistently associated with the inhibition of the expected morphological effects of cholesterol feeding, namely, the diabetic state and a degree of visible lipemia considerably greater than that observed in the control animals. The inhibitory effect observed in these experiments would appear to depend upon some as yet undetermined factor or factors implicit in the diabetic state or closely associated with it. The experimental data presented demonstrate clearly that hypercholesterolemia is not the sole factor concerned in the genesis of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis, but that another factor, or factors, rendered inoperative in our experiments must be essential to the production of the arterial lesions. In view of the inhibitory effect on the development of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis observed in alloxan-diabetic rabbits, the effect of alloxan diabetes on the retrogression of such arterial lesions was studied in another series of experiments. No effect on retrogression could be demonstrated within periods lasting up to a maximum of 4 months after the cessation of cholesterol feeding. The results of our two series of experiments, considered together, indicate that the process of deposition of lipids in the arterial walls is governed by factors different from those that are operative in the process of removal of lipids after they have been deposited. The inhibition of the development of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in alloxan-diabetic rabbits must depend on interference with the process of deposition of lipids and not on a process of removal of lipids as fast as they are deposited. Our experimental results find no direct application to the problem of arterial disease in human diabetes. Nevertheless, the experimental procedures that we have employed provide a new basis for the design of further experiments directed toward the elucidation of the nature of the unknown factors that govern the process of lipid deposition in the walls of arteries.</AbstractText>"}

The measurements of amylase and lipase in the serum are the most reliable criteria in the diagnosis of acute disease. Related changes may include hypocalcemia, hypopotassemia, hyperlipemia, hyperglycemia and decreased renal function. In chronic pancreatitis, there is less fluctuation in the amounts of the enzymes in the blood. The presence of diabetes mellitus, demonstration of calculi by x-ray, and examination of the stools for excess fat and meat fibers are more important diagnostic guides. In cancer of the pancreas, function tests using secretin stimulation of the gland followed by an examination of the external secretion or determination of the serum amylase have been used with some success.</AbstractText>"}

There is a paucity of symptoms and physical findings in mild and moderate degrees of insufficiency and in such circumstances laboratory methods are necessary to determine the presence of insufficiency. The clinical picture when insufficiency is well established may be characterized by loss in weight; vague indigestion; voluminous, light-colored, glistening stools in which fat globulets may be seen; changes in the concentration of pancreatic enzymes in the blood indicative of lowered pancreatic function; diminished amounts of pancreatic enzymes in the duodenal juice, and the related poor digestion of fat and protein in the food. Lowered tolerance of carbohydrate, as found in diabetes mellitus, may or may not be present. The location and character of the disease in the pancreas causing the insufficiency may or may not be apparent.</AbstractText>"}

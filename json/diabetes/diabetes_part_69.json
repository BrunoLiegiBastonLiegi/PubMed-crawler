The fasting skin glucose level reflects the blood glucose level which in turn depends upon diabetic control. 2. The ratio of skin to blood glucose is slightly higher in diabetics taking insulin (71%)than in diabetics controlled with tolbutamide or diet alone (69%) and both are statistically higher than in normal persons (55%) (P &lt; 0.01). Comparison of diabetics with cutaneous infection and diabetics without cutaneous infection show that: 1. The presence of cutaneous infection in diabetics does not consistently correlate with higher ratios of skin to blood glucose as measured by the technics used in this study. 2. In certain instances the skin glucose may equal the blood glucose concentration (i.e. skin: mg/100 gm (w.w.)/blood: mg/100 cc (vol.).</AbstractText>"}

Atherosclerosis apparently is the result of hepatic failure to produce a stable suspension of cholesterol esters in the plasma. In some instances this represents an inherent metabolic defect. Usually it represents improper diet, namely, the excessive intake of saturated fatty acids and the inadequate intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Excessive ingestion of carbohydrates, insufficient physical exercise and reduced thyroid function are contributing causes. The final common denominators leading to tissue injury and destruction are vascular insufficiency and hypoxia. Hypertension is a separate disease, often concurrent with atherosclerosis. In diabetes, also a separate disease, atherosclerosis is one of the sequelae. Therapy primarily consists of the reduction or elimination of meat and milk fats from the diet, and the inclusion or increase of marine fats and vegetable oils. Simultaneously, carbohydrate intake is restricted. Adequate thyroid function, a normal hemoglobin level, and sufficient physical exercise are important. A supplementary intake of vitamins B6 and E, and of lipotropic substances is recommended.</AbstractText>"}

Another current concept holds that an increased amount of this lipogenically active but glycolytically impaired insulin is the mechanism producing obesity in diabetes as a premellitic sign. Despite changed concepts the importance and effectiveness of prophylactic weight control in the premellitic stage, and as the fundamental treatment in all stages of obesity-diabetes remains the same. The order of preference in the addition of specific drugs to the dietary treatment of obesity-diabetes is anorexigenic agents, phenformin, single sulfonylureas, and combined chlorpropamide-phenformin. Insulin is the therapy of last resort in this usually mild form of diabetes. There is great potential usefulness for oral hypoglycemic combination therapy (with steroids temporarily if necessary) as a replacement for insulin in the treatment of immunologically-produced insulin resistance.</AbstractText>"}

Free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, short-chain acylcarnitine and acid-insoluble carnitine (probably long-chain acylcarnitine) have been measured in rat tissues. 2. Starvation caused an increase in the proportion of carnitine that was acetylated in liver and kidney; at least in liver fat-feeding had the same effect, whereas a carbohydrate diet caused a very low acetylcarnitine content. 3. In heart, on the other hand, starvation did not cause an increase in the acetylcarnitine/carnitine ratio, whereas fat-feeding caused a decrease. The acetylcarnitine content of heart was diminished by alloxan-diabetes or a fatty diet, but not by re-feeding with carbohydrate. 4. Under conditions of increased fatty acid supply the acid-insoluble carnitine content was increased in heart, liver and kidney. 5. The acylation state of carnitine was capable of very rapid change. Concentrations of carnitine derivatives varied with different methods of obtaining tissue samples, and very little acid-insoluble carnitine was found in tissues of rats anaesthetized with Nembutal. In liver the acetylcarnitine (and acetyl-CoA) content decreased if freezing of tissue samples was delayed; in heart this caused an increase in acetylcarnitine. 6. Incubation of diaphragms with acetate or dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate caused the acetylcarnitine content to become elevated. 7. Perfusion of hearts with fatty acids containing an even number of carbon atoms, dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate or pyruvate resulted in increased contents of acetylcarnitine and acetyl-CoA. Accumulation of these acetyl compounds was prevented by the additional presence of propionate or pentanoate in the perfusion medium; this prevention was not due to extensive propionylation of CoA or carnitine. 8. Perfusion of hearts with palmitate caused a severalfold increase in the content of acid-insoluble carnitine; this increase did not occur when propionate was also present. 9. Comparison of the acetylation states of carnitine and CoA in perfused hearts suggests that the carnitine acetyltransferase reactants may remain near equilibrium despite wide variations in their steady-state concentrations. This is not the case with the citrate synthase reaction. It is suggested that the carnitine acetyltransferase system buffers the tissue content of acetyl-CoA against rapid changes.</AbstractText>"}

Types I and II hexokinase were distinguished in adipose tissue by their different stabilities to heat treatment, which made it possible to determine the activity of each form spectrophotometrically; additional confirmatory evidence was obtained from starch-gel electrophoresis. Type II hexokinase was markedly depressed in adipose tissue from alloxan-diabetic rats. Lung contained types I, II and III hexokinase, type I predominating. There was no significant change in the pattern of these multiple forms of hexokinase in lung from alloxan-diabetic rats. These results are discussed in relation to current ideas that the insulin-sensitivity of a tissue may be correlated with the content of type II hexokinase.</AbstractText>"}

Observations made in subjects with diverted portal circulation indicate that the alimentary insulinogenic mechanism is located in the intestinal tract. The insulinogenic potency of the alimentary and glycemic stimuli expressed in terms of insulin secretion per gram of glucose were remarkably similar within each group of individuals. Between these groups, however, there were considerable differences. Obesity, with or without associated diabetes, was associated with a true hypersecretory responsiveness, whereas diabetes was characterized, with or without obesity, by a marked impairment in insulin secretion. The experimental design used in these studies permitted quantitation of the magnitude of the glycemic component of an oral glucose load. As a consequence of impaired insulin secretion, a greater than normal proportion of the oral glucose load escapes initial hepatic extraction in the maturity-onset diabetic and enters the peripheral circulation. Therefore, in the noninsulin-requiring maturity-onset diabetic, the glycemic insulinogenic stimulus for a given oral glucose load is significantly greater than in normal subjects and accounts for the excessive plasma insulin responses observed late in the course of an oral glucose tolerance test.</AbstractText>"}

Males and females seem about equally affected in Western Nigeria, whereas it predominantly affects males in France, Britain, and North America. Diabetes mellitus was the commonest complication in this series, and brought many patients to the doctor. In this series chronic relapsing pancreatitis was a rare cause; there was no history of alcoholism; and protein malnutrition was thought to be responsible for pancreatic calcification in over 90% of the patients.</AbstractText>"}

This is due to the fact that the patterns which mask the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in nondiabetic patients occur more frequently in diabetic individuals. It is important to note that in no instance were the electrocardiograms interpreted as normal in the diabetic group.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":5353528,"Title":"Effects of insulin on the pattern of glucose metabolism in the perfused working and Langendorff heart of normal and insulin-deficient rats.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Nov 1969","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. The metabolic pattern of [U-(14)C]glucose in the isolated rat heart has been studied, with both retrograde aortic (Langendorff) and atrially (working) perfused preparations in the presence and absence of insulin, in normal animals, animals rendered insulin-deficient (by injection of anti-insulin serum 1hr. before excision of the heart) and animals rendered diabetic by streptozotocin injection 7 days before use. 2. Radioautochromatograms of heart extracts show that the pattern of glucose metabolism in heart muscle is more complex than in diaphragm muscle. In addition to (14)CO(2), glycogen, oligosaccharides, phosphorylated sugars and lactate (the main metabolites formed from [(14)C]glucose in diaphragm muscle), (14)C label from [(14)C]glucose appears in heart muscle in glutamate, glutamine, aspartate and alanine, and in tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates. 3. By a quantitative scanning technique of two-dimensional chromatograms it was found that a mechanical work load stimulates glucose metabolism, increasing by a factor of 2-3 incorporation of (14)C into all the metabolites mentioned above except lactate and phosphorylated sugars, into which (14)C incorporation is in fact diminished; (14)CO(2) production is equally stimulated. 4. Addition of insulin to the perfusion fluid of the working heart causes increases in (14)C incorporation, by a factor of about 1.5 into (14)CO(2), by a factor of about 3-5 into glycogen, lactate and phosphorylated sugars, by a factor of about 2-3 into glutamate and tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates and by a factor of about 0.5 into aspartate, whereas incorporation into alanine and glutamine is not affected. The effect of a work load on the pattern of glucose metabolism is thus different from that of insulin. 5. Increasing the concentration of glucose in the perfusion fluid from 1 to 20mm leads to changes of the pattern of glucose metabolism different from that brought about by insulin. (14)CO(2) production steadily increases whereas [(14)C]lactate and glycogen production levels off at 10mm-glucose, at values well below those reached in the presence of insulin. 6. In Langendorff hearts of animals rendered insulin-deficient by anti-insulin serum or streptozotocin, glucose uptake, formation of (14)CO(2) and [(14)C]lactate, and (14)C incorporation into glycogen and oligosaccharides are decreased. In insulin-deficient working hearts, however, glucose uptake and (14)CO(2) production are normal, whereas incorporation of (14)C into glycogen and [(14)C]lactate production are greatly decreased. 7. Insulin added to the perfusion fluid restores (14)C incorporation from glucose into (14)CO(2), glycogen and lactate in the Langendorff heart from animals rendered insulin-deficient by anti-insulin serum; in hearts from streptozotocin-diabetic animals addition of insulin restores (14)C incorporation into glycogen and lactate, but (14)CO(2) production remains about 50% below normal. 8. The bearing of these results on the problem of the mode of action of insulin is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Measurements were made of the activities of nine glycolytic enzymes in epididymal adipose tissues obtained from rats that had undergone one of the following treatments: starvation; starvation followed by re-feeding with bread or high-fat diet; feeding with fat without preliminary starvation; alloxan-diabetes; alloxan-diabetes followed by insulin therapy. 2. In general, the activities of the glycolytic enzymes of adipose tissue, unlike those of liver, were not greatly affected by the above treatments. 3. The ;key' glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, were generally no more adaptive in response to physiological factors than other glycolytic enzymes such as glucose phosphate isomerase, fructose diphosphate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. 4. Adiposetissue pyruvate kinase did not respond to feeding with fat in a manner similar to the liver enzyme. 5. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase had a behaviour pattern unlike the other eight glycolytic enzymes studied in that its activity was depressed by feeding with fat and was not restored to normal by re-feeding with a high-fat diet after starvation. These results are discussed in relation to the requirements of adipose tissue for glycerol phosphate in the esterification of fatty acids. 6. A statistical analysis of the results permitted the writing of linear equations describing the relationships between the activities of eight of the enzymes studied. 7. Evidence is presented for the existence of two constant-proportion groups amongst the enzymes studied, namely (i) glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and (ii) triose phosphate isomerase, fructose diphosphate aldolase and pyruvate kinase. 8. Mechanisms for maintaining the observed relationships between the activities of the enzymes in the tissue are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetogenic activity could be demonstrated between the doses of 25 and 100 mg/kg, all indices used showing some degree of correlation with the dose administered. Ketonuria was only seen with the largest dose, 100 mg/kg. The most striking and precise correlation was that between the dose and the pancreatic IRI content 24 hr after administration of the drug, and it is suggested that this represents a convenient test system either for both related and unrelated beta cytotoxic compounds or for screening for modifying agents or antidiabetic substances of a novel type. Ability to produce graded depletion of pancreatic IRI storage capacity led to an analysis of the relationship between pancreatic IRI content and deranged carbohydrate metabolism. Abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin response were seen when pancreatic IRI was depleted by about one-third, while fasting hyperglycemia and gross glycosuria occurred when the depletion had reached two-thirds and three-quarters, respectively. The mild yet persistent anomaly produced by the lowest effective streptozotocin dose, 25 mg/kg, exhibits characteristics resembling the state of chemical diabetes in humans and might thus warrant further study as a possible model. Finally, the loss of the diabetogenic action of streptozotocin by pretreatment with nicotinamide was confirmed and was shown to be a function of the relative doses of nicotinamide and streptozotocin and of the interval between injections.</AbstractText>"}

A characteristic histological pattern was observed in all the cases consisting of diffuse degenerative abnormalities of the brain tissue, often with severe pseudocalcinosis or with atrophy of the dentate nucleus, demyelinisation of the cranial nerves, fibrosis of the leptomeninges and angiopathy. The degenerative changes were so pronounced that a dual pathogenesis seems likely; viz. an ischemia caused by the angiopathy and a primary diabetic abnormality of the brain tissue. The clinical symptoms of cerebral disease varied from insignificant to pronounced. A correlation was found between the symptoms and the number of areas of softening in the brain. The histological pattern differs from that seen in other clinical conditions and justifies the term diabetic encephalopathy. </AbstractText>"}

Fifty hospitalized patients with insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus were selected according to the presence of proteinuria and divided into two groups: group I, with or without only minor symptoms of diabetic angiopathy; group II, with moderate to severe diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy grades 1 to 3. In all patients the urinary excretion of haptoglobins (Hp) and of isoagglutins (IA) was measured, as well as the Hp level in the serum and the overall profile of serum and urine proteins. The results indicate that the urinary excretion of Hp and IA could be correlated to some extent with the severity of diabetic nephropathy, whereas the serum level of Hp failed to exhibit any clear-cut anomalies in the presence of diabetic angiopathy. In patients with severe nephropathy, the albumin/globulin ratio in the urine was increased approximately twofold over that in serum, despite a grossly unaltered profile of serum proteins. These results suggest that the 'functional pore size' of the renal filter is increased in diabetic nephropathy, but that the mechanism of proteinuria also involves degradation of serum proteins during passage through the kidney. </AbstractText>"}

GTT) were carried out on 492 patients of both sexes, aged from 5 to 78 years. Three hundred and fifty-nine non-diabetics in all were suspected clinically of reduced carbohydrate tolerance leaving 133 patients for comparison (controls). In 102 obesity was noted, 221 had a family history of diabetes and 36 had experienced complications with previous pregnancies. Patients were divided into two groups: i.e. below and above 40 years of age and subdivided again according to normal weight or obesity. At the oral test 100 g glucose was given and the blood sugar determined every 30 min for 180 min. The intravenous test was performed according toCONARD's method(5). Age did not affect the glucose tolerance test in the healthy patient (controls), and following oral or intravenous tests no appreciable difference was noted between the younger and older groups, apart from the 60 min oral estimation; the average age of the older group, however, being relatively low at 54 years. Both groups together showed a general upper biological limit (mean value + 2s D ). The oral tests in patients below 40 years of age with accompanying slight obesity, in patients with a family history of diabetes and in patients of normal weight with complications in previous pregnancies, showed no appreciable difference from those of the corresponding age groups of normal weight; yet the intravenous test was significantly different in all groups concerned. In the case of patients of the same age but with gross obesity (more than + 30% according to Broca), in patients with a family history of diabetes with accompanying obesity and in obese patients with complications in previous pregnancies, significantly abnormal curves were found with the oral as well as i.v. test. In the same groups, above the age of 40 years, in comparison with controls of normal weight and corresponding age, the curves of the oral as well as intravenous tests were significantly different and became more so when gross obesity was present or other symptoms were combined with obesity. In patients clinically suspected of impaired glucose tolerance the carbohydrate tolerance became poorer with increasing age and obesity. According to our observations it would appear simpler to elicit a reduced glucose tolerance with the i.v. method than with the oral test. </AbstractText>"}

In 3 groups the renal vessels were clamped during, and for some minutes after, the injection. The histological appearance of the kidneys after 5, 10 and 15 months of diabetes was compared with findings in groups of untreated rats of the same age as well as in non-diabetic rats treated with insulin throughout comparable periods. The glomeruli of the alloxan diabetic rats showed changes similar but not quite identical to the human diabetic glomerulopathy. These changes were present only after diabetes of 10 months. The main difference is that the rats showed no actual nodules and that the PAS-positive hyalinosis of the arterioles, characteristic of human longterm diabetes, was absent. The glomerular changes are not age-conditioned, and the results do not suggest that the administration of insulin or direct alloxan damage played any role in inducing these lesions. Tubular damage (atrophy, dilatation) and interstitial fibrosis were most marked in rats which had not been protected against the high initial alloxan concentration in the blood by clamping the renal vessels. </AbstractText>"}

The endocrine tissue contributes up to 15 per cent of the pancreatic mass in adults, up to 25 per cent in the newborn. Pancreatic insulin content may be as high as 100 units per gram wet weight. When fedad libitum in the laboratory approximately one-half of the animals become obese, while approximately 15 per cent develop a diabetes mellitus-like state with moderate hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and, less frequently, ketonuria accompanied by weight loss and, ultimately, death. The development of the diabetic state is associated with degranulation and, later, striking glycogenic degeneration of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. There is also severe glycogenic nephrosis and myocardosis and preliminary observations suggest the presence of thickening of the capillary basement membrane of the renal glomeruli and in the endocrine pancreas. The interrelationships of hyperplasia of the islets of Langerhans, obesity, and diabetes mellitus are as yet to be established, as are the genetic characteristics of each of these entities. An important area of potential usefulness derives from the degree of the hyperplasia of the endocrine tissue, since this should greatly facilitate ultrastructural studies, microdissection and transplantation, as well as organ or tissue culture work. Also, the association of anomalies observed in these spiny mice may, through their systematic study, provide clues for the study of the association of diabetes and obesity with relative hyperinsulinism in man. </AbstractText>"}

Obesity, hypertension and angiopathy were present in most of these patients. Metabolic investigations afforded valuable proof of hypercorticism associated with depressed activity of insulin. Nevertheless, increased steroiduria was also observed in groups of non-hirsute diabetic women carefully paired for age. Thus the Achard-Thiers syndrome cannot be separated with certainty from common overt diabetes. </AbstractText>"}

These analyses were carried out on samples from five normal children, six diabetic children consuming a standard diabetic diet, 17 diabetic children prescribed a diet rich in corn oil since diagnosis 4-7 years ago, and 2 brothers with familial hypercholesterolemia on a corn oil diet for 3 yr. The results obtained showed that: (1) The composition of adipose tissue triglycerides in the diabetic children on a standard diet was similar to that in the normal children. (2) The 17 diabetic children were consuming different quantities of corn oil. (3) There was a highly significant correlation between the percentage of linoleic acid present in adipose tissue and in the fasting plasma FFA fraction. It is therefore concluded that future assessments of the adherence of these diabetic children to their corn oil diet will be possible by examination of the fasting plasma FFA fraction, obviating the need for repeated adipose tissue biopsies. (4) The sum of the concentration of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids of the same chain length in adipose tissue was similar to that in the fasting plasma FFA fraction, even though the proportions of individual acids were different in the two fractions.</AbstractText>"}

Serum samples are overlayered with a sodium chloride density gradient in a preparative ultracentrifuge tube and thin layers are removed at the top of the tube after successive centrifugations at different speeds in a swinging bucket rotor. The procedure was evaluated by electron microscopy of the S(f) &gt; 400 lipoprotein fractions and schlieren analysis of the S(f) 20-400 lipoprotein fractions. Protein content of each fraction was measured by elemental N, C, H, and lipid-P analysis. Protein coverage was calculated for all fractions on the assumption that there is a surface layer 20 A thick. For the entire S(f) &gt; 400 lipoprotein spectrum and for a part of the S(f) 20-400 lipoprotein distribution the proportion of surface covered by protein was constant (approximately 20% coverage). Therefore, for these portions of the lipoprotein spectrum, the increase in surface: volume ratio as particle size decreases is approximately compensated for by an increase in the weight percentage of protein.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":5822593,"Title":"Control of insulin secretion during fasting hyperglycemia in adult diabetics and in nondiabetic subjects during infusion of glucose.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Oct 1969","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>In obese adult diabetics, the concentration of insulin in venous plasma was unrelated to the degree of hyperglycemia after an overnight fast. However, in these subjects, insulin rose and fell in proportion to the magnitude of change in plasma glucose induced by small intravenous infusions of glucose. The minimal dose of glucose to cause a significant rise in insulin above the fasting level was similar in normal subjects, obese nondiabetic subjects, and in obese, hyperglycemic adult diabetics. This dose lay between infusion of 60 and 100 mg of glucose per min for 30 min. These results suggested that the secretion of insulin was under regulation by changes in blood glucose but was not stimulated in proportion to the stable raised blood glucose concentration of the hyperglycemic diabetic. Artificial hyperglycemia was induced in fasting normal subjects by constant intravenous infusion of glucose at rates of 100-250 mg of glucose per min for periods up to 8 hr. Plasma glucose rose during the 1st hr of infusion and then remained constantly elevated for up to 8 hr. The concentration of plasma insulin paralleled that of plasma glucose. During the period of constant hyperglycemia and elevated insulin, superimposition of a brief additional glucose load resulted in a prompt rise in glucose and insulin, both returning to the previous elevated levels. Thus in normals as well as obese diabetics, stable hyperglycemia does not produce a pancreatic response sufficient to return the blood glucose to an arbitrary normal fasting concentration, yet the beta cells remain readily responsive to a change in plasma glucose. These data suggest that the beta cells do not operate as a control system with an absolute reference point when presented with systemic hyperglycemia. The behavior of the beta cells during hyperglycemia in the fasting obese adult diabetic suggests that the regulation of the basal insulin secretion may not be determined by factors directly related to the prevailing concentration of glucose. It is postulated that the beta cells adapt to hyperglycemia perhaps through the operation of controls directed toward a normal delivery of free fatty acids or some other cellular metabolic substrate during fasting.</AbstractText>"}

A broad and relatively continuous spectrum of steady-state plasma triglyceride concentrations was produced in 31 of the 33 subjects during 3 wk of a high carbohydrate (fat-free) liquid formula diet. Two patients developed plasma triglyceride concentrations in excess of 2000 mg/100 ml, and these were the only patients we have studied in which carbohydrate induction of hypertriglyceridemia seemed to be associated with a defect in endogenous plasma triglyceride removal mechanisms. In the remaining 31 patients the degree of hypertriglyceridemia was highly correlated with the insulin response elicited by the ingestion of the high carbohydrate formula (P &lt; 0.005). No significant correlation existed between fasting plasma triglyceride concentration and either plasma glucose or free fatty acid concentrations after the high carbohydrate diet, nor was the degree of hypertriglyceridemia related to degree of obesity. It is suggested that hypertriglyceridemia in most subjects results from an increase in hepatic triglyceride secretion rate secondary to exaggerated postprandial increases in plasma insulin concentration.</AbstractText>"}

Retina in vitro showed progressive uptake of non-esterified fatty acid, given in the form of complexes with bovine serum albumin. The rate of influx was related linearly to the concentration of non-esterified fatty acid in the incubation medium and was enhanced by glucose. 2. There was some exchange between medium and tissue non-esterified fatty acid, particularly in the early stages of incubation, and this probably corresponded to the rapid labelling of one component of the tissue non-esterified fatty acid pool. A much slower exchange with tissue non-esterified fatty acid was also evident, not reaching equilibrium even after 7(1/2) hr. incubation. Within the tissue, non-esterified fatty acid also found its way into the fat esters, and about 10% of the uptake was oxidized to carbon dioxide. 3. At high concentrations of non-esterified fatty acid in the medium, disproportionately more of the ingoing non-esterified fatty acid was found in the fat esters of the tissue, whereas the proportion in the tissue non-esterified fatty acid pool or oxidized to carbon dioxide did not change. 4. The role of non-esterified fatty acid as an energy-producing oxidizable substrate is discussed and the regulating influence of glucose on the metabolism of non-esterified fatty acid considered.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":14348201,"Title":"INFLUENCE OF PANCREATIC HORMONES ON ENZYMES CONCERNED WITH UREA SYNTHESIS IN RAT LIVER.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Feb 1965","Keywords":"ALLOXAN DIABETES, AMINO ACID METABOLISM, ARGINASE, EXPERIMENTAL LAB STUDY, GLUCAGON, HOMOGENATES, INSULIN, PROTAMINE ZINC, LIGASES, LIVER ENZYMOLOGY, LYASES, ORNITHINE CARBAMOYL- TRANSFERASE, PHARMACOLOGY, RATS, UREA","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. The activities of enzymes of the urea cycle [carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamoylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinase (these last two comprising the arginine-synthetase system) and arginase] have been measured in control, alloxan-diabetic and glucagon-treated rats. In addition, measurements were made on alloxan-diabetic rats treated with protamine-zinc-insulin. 2. Treatment of rats with glucagon for 3 days results in a marked increase in the activities of three enzymes of the urea cycle (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinase). The pattern of change in the alloxan-diabetic group is very similar to that of the glucagon-treated group, although the magnitude of the change was much greater. 3. Comparison was made of the actual and potential rate of urea synthesis in normal and diabetic rats. In both groups the potential rate of urea production, as measured by the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase, slightly exceeds the actual rate of synthesis by liver slices in the presence of substrates. The relative activities of the actual and potential rates were similar in the two groups of animals, this ratio being 1:0.70. 4. In the alloxan-diabetic rats treated with protamine-zinc-insulin for 2.5 or 4 days there was a marked increase in liver weight. This was associated with a rise in the total hepatic activity of the urea-cycle enzymes located in the soluble fraction of the cell (the arginine-synthetase system and arginase) after 2.5 days of treatment. After 4 days of treatment the concentration of these enzymes/g. of liver decreased, and the total hepatic content then reverted to the untreated alloxan-diabetic value. 5. No effects of glucagon or of insulin in vitro could be found on the rate of urea production by liver slices. 6. The present results are discussed in relation to how far this pattern of change is typical of conditions resulting in a high urea output, and comparison has been made with other values in the literature.</AbstractText>"}

After a latent period varying from six to 12 months, retinal hemorrhages disappeared, vitreous hemorrhages stopped and new vessels regressed. Eight of 10 patients followed up for more than a year had a complete remission, although in one of two patients whose ablation was incomplete the retinopathy remained active. Preoperative visual acuity levels were preserved in 47 of 50 eyes of patients followed up for a mean period of 12 months. Three patients have died, two from causes related to their operation. Twenty of the survivors have continued in their usual occupation. Pituitary ablation is effective in preventing the progressive visual deterioration usually associated with advanced diabetic retinopathy.</AbstractText>"}

The control of blood sugar (with similar doses of insulin) achieved by the two techniques is similar, and their effect on local tissues is also similar. In the patients studied, jet injection appeared to be a very satisfactory method of administering insulin and has met with good patient-acceptance. Jet injection is also a useful method for the visually handicapped.</AbstractText>"}

Hemoglobin, blood cell morphology, serum protein-bound iodine, serum proteins, serum lipids and serum total cholesterol estimations, urinalyses, and agglutination studies for brucellosis were carried out. Hemoglobin levels were in the normal range; however, increased contact with civilization appeared to be associated with lower hemoglobin levels. Eleven per cent of the Eskimos showed eosinophilia. Serum proteins were normal. Serum lipids and serum cholesterol levels were higher in Eskimo children living in a government residential school than in a comparable group living on the Barren Lands. Serum protein-bound iodine levels were in the upper euthyroid range. Diabetes mellitus occurs among Eskimos. Sporadic cases of brucellosis also occur.</AbstractText>"}

Twelve patients (15%) had positive urine cultures. No patient had a positive renal-biopsysite culture. Three patients (4%) had positive renal-tissue cultures. There was essentially no correlation found between the presence of positive urine cultures, positive tissue cultures, and the histological diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis. It is suggested that factors other than the continued presence of bacteria in the kidney may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic pyelonephritis.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":5810081,"Title":"The pentose phosphate pathway of glucose metabolism. Hormonal and dietary control of the oxidative nd non-oxidative reactions and related enzymes of the cycle in adipose tissue.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Sep 1969","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. Measurements were made of the activities of the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway concerned in both the oxidative (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) and the non-oxidative (ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, ribulose 5-phosphate epimerase, transketolase and transaldolase) reactions of this pathway, together with hexokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase, in adipose tissue in a variety of nutritional and hormonal conditions. 2. Starvation for 2 days caused a significant decrease in the activities of all the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, with the exception of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, when expressed as activity/2 fat-pads; only the activities of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase and ribulose 5-phosphate epimerase were significantly decreased on the basis of activity/mg. of protein. Re-feeding with a high-carbohydrate or high-fat diet for 3 days restored the activity of all the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway to the range of the control values, with the exception of transketolase, which showed a marked ;overshoot' in rats re-fed with carbohydrate. Starvation for 3 days caused a marked decrease in the activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and transketolase. 3. On the basis of activity/two fat-pads, alloxan-diabetes caused a marked decrease, to about half the control value, in the activities of all the enzymes concerned in the pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase showing the smallest decrease; hexokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase activities were also decreased. Treatment with insulin for 3 and 7 days raised the activities to normal or supranormal values, transketolase showing the most marked ;overshoot' effect. On the basis of activity/mg. of protein the activity of none of the enzymes was significantly decreased in alloxan-diabetes; transketolase and transaldolase activities were raised above the control values. With insulin treatment for 3 or 7 days the activities of all the enzymes were significantly increased, except that of ribulose 5-phosphate epimerase at the shorter time-interval. Glucagon treatment did not alter any of the enzyme activities expressed on either basis. 4. Thyroidectomy caused a decrease of 30-40% in the activities of enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, except for transketolase activity, which fell to 50% of the control value. Little change occurred in adipose-tissue weight or protein content. 5. Adrenalectomy caused a decrease of 40% in the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and of 20-30% in the activities of the remaining enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway; hexokinase activity was also decreased. Treatment with cortisone for 3 days did not significantly raise the activity from that found in adrenalectomized rats. Treatment of normal rats with high doses of cortisone had no significant effect on the activities of the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway in adipose tissue. 6. The changes in enzyme activities are discussed in relation to: (a) the concept of constant-proportion groups of enzymes; (b) the known changes in the flux of glucose through alternative metabolic pathways; (c) the pattern of change found in liver with similar hormonal and dietary conditions.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":6061732,"Title":"The significance of basal insulin levels in the evaluation of the insulin response to glucose in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Oct 1967","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The level of insulin after an overnight fast (basal) in 37 obese and nonobese male subjects with normal and abnormal carbohydrate tolerance was directly related to the increase in insulin concentration during a 3 hr 100 g oral glucose tolerance test. Obesity, but not diabetes, was associated with an elevation of this basal insulin level. Thus obesity predicted with the magnitude of the insulin response to glucose ingestion. When the individual insulin values were expressed as per cent change from the basal level, this effect of obesity was excluded. The insulin levels of all subjects with normal carbohydrate tolerance promptly rose 5-7-fold, and reached peak values 1 hr after oral glucose. In contrast, the diabetic response (as per cent increase) was markedly reduced during the 1st hr, and maximal (but still subnormal) insulin levels were not attained until 2 hr. In all subjects the insulin response (quantitated by calculation of the area circumscribed by a plot of the per cent change in insulin with time) showed a significant inverse correlation with the glucose response. Thus increasing degrees of carbohydrate intolerance were associated with decreasing insulin responses. Elevated levels of insulin, in both the basal state and in response to glucose, were related to obesity.</AbstractText>"}

Cells from normal subjects and the progeny of conjugal diabetics have similar lifespans after multiple passages in mass culture. The combined lifespans in vitro are inversely proportional to the age of the donor. When individual cells are plated, more of those from normal subjects are able to form colonies. The difference in plating efficiency is apparent when first tested after 20 generations of growth, persists at 30 and 40 generations, but disappears after 50 generations. This cell culture system should be useful in studying the inheritance of the diabetic gene(s), the pathogenesis of the diabetic state, and the relationship between aging and diabetes, both of which decrease plating efficiency.</AbstractText>"}

The patients were not clinically dehydrated and direct determinations showed that the blood and plasma volumes, the endogenous creatinine clearance, and the urinary output of antidiuretic hormone were normal. For these and other reasons it is concluded that the metabolic picture results not from diminished circulatory volume, water deficiency, sodium deficiency, undetected diabetes insipidus or osmotic diuresis, but from the cerebral damage itself. In these and other cited cases, the cerebral damage was localized chiefly in the frontal lobes, hypothalamus or lower brain-stem, thus suggesting a descending pathway, the relationship of which to the pineal area controlling aldosterone secretion requires clarification.</AbstractText>"}

Similar well established granulomata in rabbits with acute alloxan diabetes induced 8, 10, and 15 days after injection of the fungus uniformly showed activation of the infection. This occurred only in animals showing acetonuria. In these animals the skin lesions showed proliferation of the fungus frequently associated with invasion and early necrosis of the granuloma wall. In some instances, spread of the infection to adjacent tissues with invasion of blood vessels had occurred. These experiments illustrate that changes in host metabolism can activate a preexisting quiescent infection.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":5796358,"Title":"Derivation of a three compartment model describing disappearance of plasma insulin-131-I in man.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Aug 1969","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Insulin-(131)I was administered intravenously to normal subjects, to patients with maturity-onset diabetes and normal renal function, and to nondiabetic patients with renal failure. The ensuing plasma disappearance curves of immunoprecipitable radioactive insulin were determined, and these data were analyzed in a variety of ways. Firstly, fractional irreversible loss rates of insulin from plasma were calculated and found to be greatly diminished in patients with renal failure (t((1/2)) = 39 min), as compared with normal (t((1/2)) = 15 min) and diabetic subjects (t((1/2)) = 12 min). Secondly, plasma insulin-(131)I disappearance curves were resolved into sums of three exponentials by the method of 'peeling,' and values for the resultant three slopes and half-lives were determined. Patients with normal renal function had similar values for all parameters, while those patients with renal failure were differentiated on the basis of the slope of the last component, with a prolongation of its half-life to 275 min (approximately twice normal). Finally, a three pool model was formulated to describe the kinetics of plasma insulin disappearance in man, representing plasma (pool 1), interstitial fluid (pool 2), and all tissues in which insulin is utilized and degraded (pool 3). The proposed model adequately describing the disappearance curves of insulin-(131)I observed in all patients indicated that volumes (per cent body weight) of pool 1 (4.04) and pool 2 (10.11), calculated on the basis of the model and the experimental data, corresponded closely to estimates of plasma and interstitial fluid volumes obtained by independent means. It also demonstrated that patients with renal failure were characterized by a decreased removal rate of insulin from pool 3 and an increased recycling rate of insulin from pool 3 to pool 2. It is concluded that the proposed model represents a reasonable description of the kinetics of insulin distribution and degradation, and that its use provides quantitative insights into the physiology of insulin metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

The three diseases for which the evidence is overwhelming are (i) duodenal ulcer, (ii) gastric ulcer, (iii) cancer of the stomach. As is stated, the ulcers are commoner in persons of group O, and cancer of the stomach in persons of group A. There is fairly strong evidence in connection with diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia; but the incidence is raised in group A, not groups O and B. It should perhaps be added that practically all the data so far come from Western Europe and North America, and the associations might be different or absent in other peoples.</AbstractText>"}

Synthesis and utilization of triglycerides.","Journal":"Lipids","Date":"May 1967","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Livers removed from normal rats, from alloxan diabetic rats maintained on insulin for two weeks (ADI+), and from insulin-treated diabetic rats from which insulin had been withdrawn two days before use (AD) were perfused in vitro with 120 mg (468 mumoles) palmitic acid-1-C(14). Under these conditions, output of TG (triglyceride) was depressed in livers from ADI+ rats and was negligible with livers from AD animals. The total incorporation of C(14) into perfusate TG paralleled the chemical measurments of TG output. The concentration of hepatic TG increased during perfusion of livers from normal or ADI+ rats but decreased during perfusion of livers from AD animals.A load of 120 mg of palmitic acid/3 hr was inadequate to maintain net accumulation of TG in livers from AD rats; furthermore it is implicit in this observation that the total load of NEFA (nonesterified fatty acid) perfusing livers from AD rats must be increased considerably to obtain a fatty liver. The total incorporation of C(14) into hepatic TG and the specific activity of hepatic TG were depressed during perfusion of livers from AD rats. The production of ketone bodies by livers from AD animals was about five times the normal rates; the output of ketone bodies did not differ from results of other experiments (1) in which the load of palmitic acid added to the medium was varied from 0-80 mg. These observations were discussed with reference to mechanisms for ketogenesis and fatty liver in alloxan diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

Hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, diabetes and gout are often associated with obesity and may be a direct result of persistent obesity in adult life. Obesity frequently has its beginnings in childhood and adolescence. Unfortunately, obesity which develops in early life is a progressive problem. Eighty per cent of overweight children and adolescents will continue to be overweight as adults.(12) Furthermore, adults with a history of obesity in childhood are the most resistant to treatment. Recent studies have shown there is more than one body constitutional type among obese adolescents. Obese adolescents tend to eat less than non-obese controls. While obesity may be found to have many different causative factors, efforts to control this disease may be most successful in the area of primary prevention.</AbstractText>"}

The citrate content of rat kidney changes little on starvation, but it doubles on induction of diabetes. Fluoroacetate poisoning has relatively little effect on the citrate content of liver under a variety of conditions except that normal female rats show a 2.4-fold increase. Fluoroacetate poisoning leads to increases in the citrate content of kidney under all conditions. The relevance of these observations to the regulation of fatty acid synthesis is discussed. The acetic anhydride-pyridine method and the pentabromoacetone method for the estimation of citrate are compared.</AbstractText>"}

The total hexokinase activity increased during lactation, that of type II increasing to a greater extent than that of type I; the type II/type I activity ratio rose from a pregnancy value of about 1 to a mid-lactation value of 3, returning to 1 on involution. The changes in type II hexokinase activity during the lactation cycle parallel the changes in the insulin sensitivity of mammary-gland tissue. A study of the effect of alloxan-diabetes on mammary-gland hexokinase during the mid-lactation period revealed that, although the total glucose-phosphorylating capacity of the mammary gland was almost unchanged, the relative contributions of type I and type II hexokinases altered, decreasing the type II/type I activity ratio to about 1.</AbstractText>"}

These were tested for albumin, blood, and glucose with Labstix commercial strips, together with microscopy for abnormal cellular excretion.One case of renal glycosuria was found but none of previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. Out of 1,096 boys, 11 (1%) had pyuria-a leucocyte count greater than 10/cu.mm.-but only four showed abnormal counts on retesting. None had urinary tract infection.Out of 1,026 girls, 96 (9.3%) had pyuria initially but 35 were normal on retesting. Of the remaining 61 girls, 59 attended the outpatients department for further investigation, and in 30 vulvitis appeared to be the sole cause. Ten were proved to have significant bacteriuria and six of them showed radiological abnormalities.It is suggested that careful long-term studies are needed to study the economics and the implications of screening on a national scale.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":4291787,"Title":"The redox state of free nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of rat liver.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"May 1967","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the lactate-, beta-hydroxybutyrate- and glutamate-dehydrogenase systems were measured in rat livers freeze-clamped as soon as possible after death. The substrates of these dehydrogenases are likely to be in equilibrium with free NAD(+) and NADH, and the ratio of the free dinucleotides can be calculated from the measured concentrations of the substrates and the equilibrium constants (Holzer, Schultz &amp; Lynen, 1956; Bücher &amp; Klingenberg, 1958). The lactate-dehydrogenase system reflects the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio in the cytoplasm, the beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial cristae and the glutamate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial matrix. 2. The equilibrium constants of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were redetermined for near-physiological conditions (38 degrees ; I0.25). 3. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio of rat-liver cytoplasm was calculated as 725 (pH7.0) in well-fed rats, 528 in starved rats and 208 in alloxan-diabetic rats. 4. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio for the mitochondrial matrix and cristae gave virtually identical values in the same metabolic state. This indicates that beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase share a common pool of dinucleotide. 5. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio within the liver mitochondria of well-fed rats was about 8. It fell to about 5 in starvation and rose to about 10 in alloxan-diabetes. 6. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios of cytoplasm and mitochondria are thus greatly different and do not necessarily move in parallel when the metabolic state of the liver changes. 7. The ratios found for the free dinucleotides differ greatly from those recorded for the total dinucleotides because much more NADH than NAD(+) is protein-bound. 8. The bearing of these findings on various problems, including the following, is discussed: the number of NAD(+)-NADH pools in liver cells; the applicability of the method to tissues other than liver; the transhydrogenase activity of glutamate dehydrogenase; the physiological significance of the difference of the redox states of mitochondria and cytoplasm; aspects of the regulation of the redox state of cell compartments; the steady-state concentration of mitochondrial oxaloacetate; the relations between the redox state of cell compartments and ketosis.</AbstractText>"}

A total of 83 such tests were carried out on 81 subjects. Applying the U.S. Public Health Service point count method to the results of the OGTT test, there were 38 normals, 23 possible diabetics and 22 diabetics. A constant (K) was calculated from the glucose disappearance rate in the IVGTT curves.K disagreed with the OGTT classification to a significant extent, especially in the possible diabetic and non-diabetic groups. Also, the correlation coefficients between K and the OGTT values were not impressive. This does not mean that one test is superior to the other, only that the accuracy of either test in diagnosing early diabetes is doubtful.Technically, the IVGTT was more difficult and time-consuming, and six of the 81 subjects suffered from thrombophlebitis at the site of glucose injection.</AbstractText>"}

These very complex interrelationships have been dealt with elsewhere (69). We hope that enough evidence has been presented to demonstrate that energy balance is normally maintained by a precise and reliable physiologic mechanism, and that the energy surplus represented by obesity may reflect direct failure of this mechanism or some combination from a variety of neurological, endocrine, enzymatic, and psychological disorders. Environmental conditions as well as genetic and traumatic factors may contribute to the development of obesity. If increasing mechanization brings tus below the level of energy expenditure at which food intake is properly regulated, appropriate habits of exercise will have to be established and maintained.</AbstractText>"}

Of these patients 38% were found to have preoperative clinical evidence of heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes; 45% had abnormal preoperative E.C.G. patterns.Three patients experienced myocardial infarction during or within 36 hours of operation, all of the occult type; all were in the preoperative abnormal groups. Non-specific postoperative E.C.G. changes were equally common in the groups of patients with normal or abnormal preoperative electrocardiograms.A relationship existed between a rise in serum lactic dehydrogenase (L.D.H.) concentration and the field of the operation, but the diagnosis of infarction was not confused provided serum L.D.H. isoenzyme patterns and a rise in serum aspartate aminotransferase (S.G.O.T.) levels were consistent with the diagnosis.</AbstractText>"}

Urine output increased 200% during the first 24 hours after irradiation. No significant changes occurred in daily sodium, potassium, urea, or total solute excretion, although calcium excretion approximately doubled after irradiation. The marked increase in free water excretion implicates antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in this phenomenon. Application of a sensitive bioassay for ADH permitted measurement of plasma ADH concentrations in undisturbed, unanesthetized rats before and after irradiation. ADH levels were lower and frequently not detectable 24 hours after exposure. High ADH levels, however, could be provoked in irradiated rats by hemorrhage, indicating that the receptor cells and secretory ability of the posterior pituitary remained intact. Furthermore, irradiated rats responded normally to small intravenous injections (4 to 8 microU) of exogenous ADH. Rats with congenital diabetes insipidus given daily injections of Pitressin showed no postirradiation diuresis. Lastly, increased urinary calcium excretion may result from hypercalcemia which is known to induce diuresis through calcium-vasopressin antagonism.

Those with unbalanced diabetes, acute infections, and severe myocardial infarction had high levels. The results obtained suggest that in a patient with a severe infection and hypotension a plasma 11-OHCS level of less than 15 mug./100 ml. indicates an inadequate adrenal cortical response, and one patient with septicaemia and temporary adrenal cortical insufficiency is described. Growth hormone levels were increased in patients with severe diabetic ketosis but not in those with hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma.</AbstractText>"}

However, the concomitant administration of actinomycin D with insulin prevents the repair of enzymatic defects in the syntheses of total fatty acids by adipose tissue, of monounsaturated fatty acids by liver microsomes, and of hepatic glycogen. The hypoglycemic action of insulin in diabetes is not modified by actinomycin injections. These findings indicate that a fundamental mechanism of action of insulin is the induction of enzyme synthesis through stimulating the renewal of cellular RNA.</AbstractText>"}

The 24 hourly excretion of pyruvate and glucose has been measured in alloxan-diabetic rats.2. The animals were allowed a 6-day control period before being injected with alloxan (I.V. 50 mg/kg body weight). The diabetes was treated by daily injections of insulin for a period of 6 days from the 7th to the 12th day following the alloxan injection.3. The pyruvate excretion increased more than 5-fold following the induction of diabetes, the values being 189 +/- 130 (S.D.) mug/24 hr in the control period rising to an average of 1002 +/- 664 (S.D.) mug/24 hr over the first 6 days of diabetes. The administration of insulin over the second 6-day period of diabetes caused the pyruvate excretion to decrease-though not significantly. Upon the withdrawal of the insulin treatment the pyruvate excretion increased significantly from 785 +/- 315 (S.D.) mug/24 hr to 2105 +/- 679 (S.D.) mug/24 hr, measured over a 5-day period. The final period of pyruvate excretion was significantly greater than the excretion over the first diabetic period.4. The glucose excretion during the initial diabetic period was 6.75 +/- 2.64 (S.D.) g/24 hr. The administration of insulin caused a 42% decrease in glucose excretion compared to a decrease of 22% for the pyruvate. The withdrawal of insulin caused the glucose excretion to increase by 149% while the pyruvate excretion increased by 157%.5. Diabetes was also induced temporarily by injections of anti-insulin serum and diazoxide. In each case significant glycosuria and hyperpyruvaturia were produced.6. The possible causes of the hyperpyruvaturia in diabetes are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The mean rates of appearance were 1.7, 4.2 and 10.9mumoles/min./100g. body wt. respectively for normal, starved and alloxan-diabetic rats. The rates of disappearance were of the same order of magnitude as the rates of appearance. 3. There was a direct correlation between the rates of appearance and disappearance and the blood concentrations of the ketone bodies. 4. The results indicate that in the rat increased ketone-body production is paralleled by increased ketone-body utilization and that the raised ketone-body concentration in the blood in starvation and alloxan-diabetes is due to a slight imbalance between the rates of production and utilization. 5. The findings are discussed in relation to the concept that ketone bodies can serve as fuels of respiration when the supply of carbohydrate is limited.</AbstractText>"}

It was established that, by treating the diabetic state with insulin, the diabetic state could be ameliorated and the inhibitory effect obviated. It was therefore concluded that the inhibitory phenomenon was not due to the injection of alloxan per se but that it was associated with one or more factors that characterize the alloxan diabetic state in the rabbit and that are reversible by insulin therapy. In the course of the experiment it was demonstrated that the inhibitory effect was apparent in cholesterol-fed diabetic rabbits whether or not their diet was supplemented with vegetable oil. The previously reported metabolic abnormalities of the diabetic animals were confirmed. It was established that suitable treatment of the cholesterol-fed diabetic animals with insulin would bring all the metabolic aberrations, including those of the serum lipids, into reasonably close correspondence with those observed in non-diabetic rabbits fed cholesterol.</AbstractText>"}

This response to glucose was abolished in subjects treated previously with ganglionic or adrenergic blocking agents. Small amounts of insulin were secreted in response to these glucose infusions, but in insulin-dependent diabetics incapable of altering plasma insulin to any great extent, the effect of glucose upon free fatty acids could be obtained provided the subjects were primed with long-acting insulin before the infusions were begun. The response of free fatty acids to doses of glucose which elevated the concentration of glucose in arterial blood by only 3 mg percent and the blockade of this response by autonomic and adrenergic blocking agents suggest that centers in the central nervous system exist which are capable of responding to elevations of arterial glucose by inhibiting the sympathetic tone partially responsible for sustaining lipolysis in fasting.</AbstractText>"}

The metabolism of [U-(14)C]glucose by the isolated diaphragm muscle of normal rats, rats rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and rats with transitory insulin deficiency after an injection of anti-insulin serum was studied. 2. The incorporation of [(14)C]glucose into glycogen and oligosaccharides was significantly decreased in the diabetic diaphragm muscle and in the muscle from rats treated with anti-insulin serum. 3. Neither diabetes nor transitory insulin deficiency influenced the oxidation of glucose, or the formation of lactate and hexose phosphate esters from glucose. 4. Insulin fully restored the incorporation of glucose into glycogen and maltotetraose in the diabetic muscle, but the incorporation into oligosaccharides, although increased in the presence of insulin, was significantly lower than the values obtained with normal diaphragm in the presence of insulin.</AbstractText>"}

In diabetic persons taking large doses of insulin, or who needed insulin for control, hyperglycemia, ketosis, and increased excretion of glucose in the urine developed when tolbutamide was substituted for insulin or was used before insulin therapy was begun. The only serious toxic manifestation observed was a skin rash in two patients. Successful control of diabetes with tolbutamide was limited to cases in which the disease was of mild, stable type and the patient was 40 or more years of age, of normal weight, and with a previous insulin requirement of 5 to 30 units per day. It was of benefit in 43.5 per cent of all diabetic patients in the series studied and in about 75 per cent of the group that might be referred to as selected. The duration of the disease and the duration of insulin therapy were unimportant in predicting effectiveness for tolbutamide therapy.</AbstractText>"}

The rates of formation of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate by the isolated perfused rat liver were measured under various conditions. 2. The rates found after addition of butyrate, octanoate, oleate and linoleate were about 100mumoles/hr./g. wet wt. in the liver of starved rats. These rates are much higher than those found with rat liver slices. 3. The differences between the rates given by slices and by the perfused organ were much higher with the long-chain than with short-chain fatty acids. The increments caused by oleate and linoleate were 12 and 16 times as large in the perfused organ as in the slices, whereas the increments caused by butyrate and octanoate were about four times as large. 4. The rates of ketogenesis in the unsupplemented perfused liver of well-fed rats, and the increments caused by the addition of fatty acids, were about half of those in the liver from starved rats. 5. The value of the [beta-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio of the medium was raised by octanoate, oleate and linoleate. 6. Carnitine did not significantly accelerate ketogenesis from fatty acids. 7. Oleate formed up to 82% of the expected yield of ketone bodies. 8. In the liver of alloxan-diabetic rats the endogenous rates of ketogenesis were raised, in some cases as high as in the liver from starved rats, after addition of oleate. 9. On addition of either beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate to the perfusion medium the liver gradually adjusted the [beta-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio towards the normal range. 10. The [beta-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio of the medium was about 0.4 when slices were incubated, but near the physiological value of 2 when the liver was perfused. 11. The experiments demonstrate that for the study of ketogenesis slices are in many ways grossly inferior to the perfused liver.</AbstractText>"}

Large amounts of virus were recovered from the pancreas during acute stages of infection. At this time blood glucose concentrations were markedly elevated and the islets of Langerhans exhibited focal necrosis and degranulation of beta cells. Evidence of abnormal glucose metabolism persisted for varying periods after recovery from the infection. The islets of Langerhans of chronically hyperglycemic mice were distorted and decreased in size, and the beta cells were degranulated. Encephalomyocarditis virus appears to cause diabetes mellitus by reducing the mass of functional beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.</AbstractText>"}

Glucokinase and hexokinase activities have been determined in the livers of newborn rats and attempts made to influence in vivo the development of the glucokinase. 2. Glucokinase first appears in rat liver about 16 days after birth and adult activities are reached 10-12 days later. Evidence is presented which indicates that this represents synthesis of new protein. Hexokinase activities remain constant throughout the period of glucokinase development. 3. Both exogenous glucose and insulin are necessary for the natural development of glucokinase, for this is retarded in starved and alloxan-diabetic neonatal rats. 4. The absence of glucokinase during the first 2 weeks of extrauterine life in the rat is not due to lack of insulin. 5. Attempts to advance the time at which glucokinase first appears by infusions of glucose, insulin and chlorpropamide alone and in various combinations have resulted in marginal effects only. 6. When rats are starved for 3 days during the period of glucokinase development and then re-fed, glucokinase is more rapidly synthesized, indicating that the potential ability to synthesize glucokinase continues to develop throughout the period of starvation. 7. Some possible reasons for the comparatively late development of glucokinase are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The criteria for this diagnosis included: (1) long-standing diabetes; (2) arthropathy, most frequently involving the foot, which shows deformity, shortening and ulceration without evidence of infection or peripheral circulatory failure; (3) abolition or diminution of pain on weight-bearing; (4) diabetic peripheral neuropathy with impaired sense of position or vibration and weak or absent deep tendon reflexes. Radiographic findings were similar to those in patients with Charcot's arthropathy from any cause.Tabes dorsalis, leprosy, syringomyelia, myelodysplasia and the arthropathies of corticosteroid therapy were ruled out in these cases. In addition to conventional medical therapy the patients were treated by means of walking-casts for several months.Diabetic neuroarthropathy is probably more common than the medical literature would indicate. Diminished sensation in the lower limbs in diabetics of long standing appears to be the major factor contributing to this disorder.</AbstractText>"}

Effect of alloxan diabetes upon the phagocytic and bactericidal efficiency of rat leukocytes for pneumococcus. J. Bacteriol. 90:1537-1541. 1965.-Chronic diabetes mellitus was induced in rats with alloxan monohydrate. Glycosuria persisted for the 6 weeks of study, but ketonuria was never encountered. The cellular composition of peritoneal exudate recovered from diabetic rats after starch aleuronat administration was the same as that obtained from normal rats. The quantity of exudate recovered from the diabetic rats was thought to be less than that obtained from normal rats subjected to the same irritant. Phagocytosis was found to be essentially the same for both diabetic and normal cells when suspended in normal saline. The killing efficiency of harvested peritoneal phagocytes suspended in saline from both diabetic and normal rats for type 1 pneumococcus was compared and no difference between the groups was found.</AbstractText>"}

The mean effects of the two drugs in the pharmacologically equivalent doses were the same. In particular, the mean reduction of the blood glucose level was 19% and of the serum triglyceride level was 17% with both agents. However, an individual subject might respond to one agent and not to the other; neither the blood glucose nor the serum lipid response could be predicted from the pretreatment blood glucose level or the per cent of ideal body weight.</AbstractText>"}

The synthesis of l-ascorbic acid and of l-xylulose from d-glucuronolactone, d-glucuronate, l-gulonate and l-gulonolactone has been studied with liver extracts from normal and alloxan-diabetic rats. 2. In diabetic animals the synthesis of ascorbic acid is impaired, and more from glucuronolactone and glucuronate than from gulonate and gulonolactone, whereas the formation of xylulose from gulonate and gulonolactone is enhanced. These changes are reversed by insulin therapy. 3. The activity of the NAD-linked gulonate dehydrogenase is enhanced during diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

In the former the capillary fragility increased with age. In the diabetic group 78 out of 195 patients had complications, and in all age groups these latter patients had more fragile capillaries.In general the capillary fragility was greater in patients taking insulin than in those taking antidiabetic tablets or on diet alone, and in the first group capillary fragility was greatest in those receiving more than 50 units daily and least in those receiving less than 25 units daily.Capillary fragility measurement by this method may be of value in assessment, prognosis, and studying the response to treatment in diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":6023769,"Title":"Insulin secretion in response to glycemic stimulus: relation of delayed initial release to carbohydrate intolerance in mild diabetes mellitus.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Mar 1967","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Insulin secretory responses to paired intravenous and oral glucose loads were determined in 38 nonobese individuals classified as normal (nondiabetic) subjects, 'mild' diabetics (fasting blood glucose below 105 mg per 100 ml), or 'moderate' diabetics (fasting glucose below 192 mg per 100 ml). Studies were also performed in 29 obese persons who were similarly grouped. The intravenous load was given to assess the alacrity of hormonal release after glycemic stimulus, and the oral glucose to determine how the speed of initial insulinogenesis modifies the disposition of ingested carbohydrate. In the nonobese group, normal subjects responded to massive hyperglycemia after rapid injection of glucose with immediate and maximal outpouring of insulin, in contrast to a desultory insulinogenic response in patients with mild diabetes, and no initial response at all in moderate diabetics. During oral glucose tolerance tests, the much faster clearance of blood sugar in nondiabetic subjects was actually associated with lower absolute insulin output than was found in mildly diabetic patients, since the latter exhibited delayed hyperinsulinemia in concert with prolonged hyperglycemia. Moderate diabetics never showed excessive insulin release despite even greater hyperglycemia. An empirical 'insulinogenic index,' the ratio relating enhancement of circulating insulin to magnitude of corresponding glycemic stimulus, was used to compare the secretory capacities of respective groups. Despite the higher absolute hormonal output after oral glucose in mild diabetics, the index revealed that insulin release in normal subjects was proportionally more than twice as great. This relatively greater normal secretory response declared itself shortly after the administration of glucose by either route, and was maintained throughout both tests. In the 29 obese individuals, differences among groups were essentially the same as in persons of normal weight. Obese nondiabetics did show much larger absolute insulinogenic responses during both tests than did nonobese controls. Since corresponding glucose tolerance curves were also higher, the mean insulinogenic indexes for obese subjects were not statistically greater. Moreover, when comparable glucose curves of obese and nonobese controls</AbstractText>"}

Each had severe cerebrovascular disease with superimposed metabolic derangements, including ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia without ketosis, mild uremia, and possibly cerebral edema. Two of the patients were examined postmortem. Severe leptomeningeal scarring, basal ganglial calcification and destruction of small intracerebral vessels without evidence of large vessel atherosclerosis were found unexpectedly in one patient, a rare occurrence in this country although recently reported from Europe. The other patient had large vessel atherosclerosis only. The clinical expression of the vascular disease was modified by concurrent abnormalities and reflected the sum total of the complexities which coexisted. The pathophysiology of the unconscious state necessarily depends on the inciting factors. Ketoacidotic coma is associated with depressed cerebral oxygen consumption. Spinal fluid pH is usually maintained during ketosis but is sometimes lowered inadvertently during bicarbonate therapy, with resultant coma. Other variables influencing the clinical expression, with or without ketosis, would include, among others, blood viscosity alterations, rapid decrements in blood sugar, and existing degrees of lactic acidosis. The increasing life-span of the juvenile diabetics, favorably influenced by improved management and recently by hemodialysis, may uncover vascular complications heretofore rarely seen and create additional diagnostic and therapeutic enigmas.</AbstractText>"}

This produced a decided reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Statistically valid comparisons were made of their fasting blood sugar levels before and after two weeks of dextrothyroxine treatment. Administration of this drug was associated with a significant elevation of fasting blood sugar levels. Good diabetic control did not preclude this adverse effect. After more prolonged treatment with the drug, 8 of the 18 patients experienced progressive deterioration of their diabetic control, necessitating increased amounts of insulin or oral drugs. Despite close observation, one patient developed acidosis. When dextrothyroxine was discontinued, there was a significant drop in blood sugar levels in these patients. Two patients had hypoglycemic reaction. When the fasting blood sugar values of the 18 patients, studied while they were receiving significant doses of dextrothyroxine, are compared with a control series of blood sugar determinations obtained on these same patients before dextrothyroxine administration was begun, the diabetogenic effect of this drug is confirmed by the highly significant difference demonstrated. Four patients were given dextrothyroxine a second time, and again experienced deterioration of diabetic control.</AbstractText>"}

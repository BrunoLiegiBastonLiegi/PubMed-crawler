{"PMID":4750443,"Title":"Response of the distal tubule and cortical collecting duct to vasopressin in the rat.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Dec 1973","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Renal micropuncture observations in the rat suggest that the entire 'distal tubule' (defined by the micropuncturist as that portion of the renal tubule extending between the macula densa and its first junction with another (renal tubule) may be responsive to vasopressin. However, this portion of the renal tubule contains two segments that are morphologically dissimilar. The 'early' distal tubule is lined by epithelium characteristic of the distal convoluted tubule, while the 'late' distal tubule is lined by epithelium characteristic of the cortical collecting duct. Thus, the present study was initiated to identify the most proximal site of action of vasopressin in the distal renal tubule. A water diuresis was established in rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus. In one-half of the animals the diuresis was interupted by an i.v. infusion of exogenous vasopressin. Morphological preservation of the kidneys was initiated after induction of vasopressin-induced antidiuresis or during maximum water diuresis. Cell swelling and dilatation of intercellular spaces, morphological findings indicative of vasopressin responsiveness, were observed in the cortical collecting duct including the late segment of the distal tubule, a segment that has also been described by morphologists as the initial collecting tubule. Morphological evidence of vasopressin-responsiveness was not observed in the early distal tubule (distal convoluted tubule). Additional morphological studies in Wistar, Long-Evans, and Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a marked difference in the random availability of distal convoluted tubules versus initial collecting tubules potentially available for micropuncture just beneath the renal capsule. The results suggest that hypotonic tubular fluid entering the early distal tubule (distal convoluted tubule) remains hypotonic to plasma until it enters the late distal tubule (initial collecting tubule) and that vasopressin-induced osmotic equilibration is a function of the latter segment alone. The findings emphasize the importance of morphological characterization of those segments of the renal tubule that are subjected to physiological investigation.</AbstractText>"}

The present experiments suggest that these discrepancies may have been due to methodology, and to nonrecognition of a circadian cycle in the glucose turnover rate that is present in health, and marked in diabetes. During the early morning hours the glucose turnover rate in maturity-onset diabetes is increased in proportion to the fasting blood glucose level. It may reach three to four times the rate found in health. During the evening hours the increments are about one-half as great. The glucose outflow rate constant, k, lower in diabetes than in health, is also lower in both groups in the evening than in the morning. An analysis of the relative contributions of glucose overproduction and underutilization to the development of hyperglycemia in maturity-onset diabetes indicates that overproduction is the greater factor. The relative role of underutilization appears to increase as the fasting blood glucose level increases. The circulating glucose oxidation rate in maturity-onset diabetes is only slightly lower than in health, but the fraction oxidized is markedly lower, and only a small fraction is excreted. The principal conclusion is that in maturity-onset diabetes there is a hypertrophied flux of endogenous glucose, most of which is neither oxidized nor excreted. The precursors and the qualitative and quantitative metabolic fates of this excess glucose are unknown.</AbstractText>"}

When implanted into nude mice, which lack a cell-mediated immune response, cultured islets were equally effective as were freshly isolated islets, in reducing the hyperglycemia. When fresh or cultured islets were allografted into diabetic NMRI mice there was only a short and transient reduction of the blood sugar, suggesting that no reduction of the antigenicity of the islets had occurred after 10 days of culture.

The hallmark of this disease was an extreme hypersiderinemia, the serum iron reaching about 800 mug/100 ml. There was a pigment cirrhosis of the liver, bronzed skin containing hemosiderin, and diabetes mellitus. Paradoxically, hemosiderin was not detectable in bone marrow macrophages, sideroblasts and erythrocytes were reduced, and there was a decrease in radioiron utilization of erythropoiesis, thus indicating insufficient iron supply. The pathogenesis of this disorder based on the formation of an autoantibody with specificity for transferrin thus producing a circulating immune complex which bound the majority of serum iron. Immunosuppression achieved a partial remission including a recovery of the patient's general state, a rise in free transferrin, a decrease in serum iron, disappearance of hemosiderin in the liver, and a rise in erythrocyte production.</AbstractText>"}

Glucagon and insulin were respectively localized in the typical A- and B-cells, whereas no subclasses of A-cells could be identified. With antibodies that reacted with the gastrin cells in the human gastric mucosa, it was not possible to detect gastrin in any of the islet cell types. In confirmation of recent results obtained by light microscopy, somatostatin was found in all the typical D-cells containing large, weakly electron-dense secretory granules. The human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP), a newly postulated hormone, was clearly associated with a fourth cell type, which is characterized by the presence of small secretory granules (100-150 nm.). These results suggest that each of the four cell types that are easily identifiable by ultrastructural observations is responsible for the production of a specific secretory product.</AbstractText>"}

After potassium loading, maximal values and increments of serum potassium were higher and fractional potassium excretion was lower in the diabetic than in the control subjects, although the differences were not statistically significant. Abnormalities of potassium homeostasis in diabetes are probably related to insulin and mineralocorticoid deficiency.

Adrenaline caused a biphasic rise in cAMP with peak values of cAMP within the first few minutes. Diaphragms of diabetic rats showed an increased responsiveness to adrenaline. Injection of insulin to diabetic rats normalized the rise in cAMP after addition of adrenaline. There was no difference in basal levels of cAMP between diaphragms of normal, diabetic or insulin-treated diabetic rats. Insulin in vitro did not affect basal cAMP-levels or the release of cAMP from the tissue but significantly decreased adrenaline-induced peak levels of cAMP. This effect of insulin was abolished by theophylline. The results of the present study suggest that experimental diabetes is associated with changes of the adenylate cyclase and/or phosphodiesterase enzyme activities in skeletal muscle resulting in an increased responsiveness to adrenaline. Since insulin in vitro depressed the adrenaline-induced elevation of cAMP the increased responsiveness in diaphragms of diabetic rats might be attributed to the specific lack of insulin.</AbstractText>"}

In a normal population, autoimmunity reactions against thyroid gland, gastric mucosa and adrenals develop slowly with increasing age and are found more frequently in women than in men (at least so far as thyroid antibodies are concerned) as is lowering of the functional activity of T lymphocytes. Diabetes takes its place among a series of factors diminishing immunocyte reactivity, and thus enhancing the development of the autoimmunity process. This may perhaps be promoted in some way by genetic factors, perhaps those which also play a definite though as yet ill-defined role in determining the emergence of diabetes. For the present, diabetes mellitus itself must only rarely be considered a consequence of an autoimmune process and then only in certain insulin-dependent cases. By contrast, diabetes appears frequently to be an activator of autoimmune phenomena against tissues other than pancreas, namely thyroid gland, adrenals and gastric mucosa. Awareness of these associations should encourage physicians to seek latent humoral or cellular evidence of autoimmune phenomena in diabetics; this would favour the early recognition of clinically important abnormalities which may accompany the diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

We studied the morphology of intraportally transplanted islets with the aid of the immunoperoxidase staining technique to identify insulin-, glucagon-, somatostatin-, and pancreatic polypeptide-containing cells at 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 39 weeks, and 65 weeks after transplant. Embolized pancreatic tissue, composed of approximately 80% acini and 20% islets, is initially distributed throughout the liver mainly to terminal branches of the portal system. Endothelialization and organization occur rapidly with the smaller fragments and within the first 4 weeks for larger thrombi. Exocrine pancreatic elements largely disappear as islet cells move into the hepatic lobules from the portal spaces. At 65 weeks after transplant, all islet cell types can be identified within large complex islet structures. The results of this study establish the survival and continued function of all known rat pancreatic islet cell types long after transplantation and support the theory that islet transplantation may represent the most physiologic replacement of hormonal deficiencies in the diabetic recipient.</AbstractText>"}

There was also a statistically significant decrease in urine flow and urine secretion of several electrolytes, while filtration fraction remained almost constant. IV insulin decreased urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin and increased albumin excretion (2 p less than 0.05). The albumin excretion induced by insulin is most likely due to increased amounts of filtered albumin, the mechanism of which remains unexplained.</AbstractText>"}

The medical records of these cases were reviewed, pertinent data were abstracted, and rigid criteria for diagnosis were followed. Also, data were obtained from death certificates, autopsy reports and long-term hospital records. A total of 606 ascertained cases (410 infarction, 137 hemorrhage, and 59 undetermined type) were matched for age, sex, residence and year of admission with 606 controls from admissions for other than cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. The data were analyzed for elucidating the possible risk factors for infarction (INF) and hemorrhage (HGE). The findings suggested that hypertension was the main risk factor in hemorrhage, whereas in infarction, along with hypertension, other factors such as diabetes, heart enlargement in chest x-ray, ECG abnormalities, and smoking were suggested as risk factors. There was an association also between infarction, on one hand, and the history of receiving anticoagulants, diuretics, and medications for the heart, and the occurrence of myocardial infarction, on the other hand. These features indicate that infarction and ischemic heart disease have similar risk factors. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were higher in infarction cases than in their controls only when measured at stroke admission. No difference was revealed when they were measured prior to stroke. Their association with infraction therefore may be secondary to other factors and of no significance for its risk.</AbstractText>"}

Glucagon binding of diabetic and control membranes was virtually identical. This increased insulin binding was not due to a nonspecific effect of streptozotocin, decreased degradation of insulin slower dissociation from its receptor, or a selective higher yield of membranes prepared from the diabetic livers. Diabetic and control membranes both showed negative cooperativity. Scatchard analysis suggested that the difference in binding was due to an enhanced binding capacity of the diabetic membranes rather than increased affinity of the binding sites. Increased insulin binding of diabetic membranes was returned to normal by insulin treatment. These data are consistent with the postulate that there is an inverse relationship between circulating insulin levels and insulin binding and that insulin may modulate its own receptor. However, since it has been reported that fat, muscle, and hepatic tissue from rats made diabetic by alloxan administration are insensitive to insulin, the capacity for binding can not be the sole factor determining the response to insulin in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, sensitivity of the diabetic liver to insulin is determined, at least in part, by events subsequent to the binding of insulin to its receptor.</AbstractText>"}

These two determinations show that the number per square micrometer (local concentration) of both structural features progressively increases with the duration of diabetes and fasting, while that at the same time their number per entire cell (total content) remains unchanged. These data thus show: (a) a reorganization of the adipose cell plasma membrane during lipolysis; and (b) that this reorganization can be detected only by determining the concentration and the total content of the structural features of the membrane involved.</AbstractText>"}

We treated streptozotocin diabetic rats with insulin and compared their duodenal calcium transport response with that of untreated diabetics and matched controls. Insulin treatment restored depressed calcium transport of diabetics to control levels in in vivo studies and significantly increased calcium transport in vitro. Previous studies showed that even in uncontrolled diabetes the mucosa retains the ability to respond to an end organ stimulus enhancing calcium transport: 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol corrects the defect, but vitamin D and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol are ineffective. Since 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is synthesized in the kidney, these findings, in conjunction with the current study, are consistent with the association of experimental diabetes with a renal defect depressing synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Since insulin treatment restores duodenal calcium transport, the renal defects is unlikely to be caused by streptozotocin nephrotoxicity.</AbstractText>"}

A similar analysis of LH extracted from human pituitaries showed most of the activity in a peak of larger molecular weight, and only minor fractions in the positions of the urinary peaks. In an extract of normal human serum, analyss showed only one similar peak of large molecular weight, which also emerged before the urinary peaks. During an i.v. infusion of pituitary LH into normal men, the urinary LH activity increased but was still found only in the same three peaks on gel filtration, and all were of a molecular weight smaller than that of the infused material; but a higher proportion of the urinary LH was found in the earliest of these peaks compared with that found before infusion. Conversely, 20-35 h after the i.v. infusion, there was a slightly higher proportion of LH activity in the third peak of smallest molecular weight. These findings suggest that the urinary immunoassayable LH, which is found in three peaks of different molecular weights, is derived from the pituitary or serum LH of higher molecular weight. The changes in the proportions of larger or smaller molecular weight fractions in the urine during and after LH infusion suggest that the earliest peak may be disaggregated serum LH, while the last or smallest molecular weight peak may comprise metabolites of LH.</AbstractText>"}

Male rats were pretreated with single i.v. injections of alloxan monohydrate (40 or 80 mg/kg) or streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). A challenging dose of CCl4 (0.1 ml/kg i.p.) was given to rats 4 days after alloxan pretreatment or 5 days after streptozotocin pretreatment, and the animals were sacrificed 24 hours later. Biochemical and morphologic evidence was obtained to show that pretreatment with the diabetogenic agents markedly enhanced CCl4-induced hepatotoxity. The challenging dose of CCl4 had no effect on the serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) activity in control rats. However, the administration of this dose of CCl4 to rats pretreated with 40 and 80 mg/kg of alloxan as well as to rats pretreated with streptozotocin resulted in 11-, 68-, and 32-fold increases, respectively, in SGPT activity. Hepatic triglyceride concentrations in the diabetic rats were also markedly elevated above control values after CCl4 challenge. Alloxan- or streptozotocin-pretreatment alone did not enhance these biochemical parameters of liver injury. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity, which increased in the rats given a diabetogenic agent, was lowered as a result of CCl4 injection. Insulin treatment of rats given alloxan (80 mg/kg) markedly protected against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. The severity of the morphologic changes in diabetic rats given CCl4 correlated with the biochemical findings.</AbstractText>"}

Liver plasma membranes, prepared from diabetic animals, showed enhanced activities of alkaline phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase and depressed 5'-nucleotidase when compared with controls. Studies of the nonprotein constituents of liver plasma membranes and red cell 'ghosts' showed similar changes in both tissues: sialic acid and cholesterol content were reduced in the membranes of diabetic animals, while phospholipids (total and individual classes) and neutral sugars were unchanged. To look for changes in relative turnover rates of individual membrane proteins, we combined a double-label in-vivo technic using [3H] and [14C] leucine with polyacrylamide gel separation of membrane proteins. No significant differences were observed between control and diabetic animals. In chronically diabetic animals, cell membranes may show significant changes in overall composition with no significant changes in the rate of protein turnover.</AbstractText>"}

A single injection of LEM results in a marked accumulation of labeled nonmetabolizable model amino acids in the liver of normal rats. The LEM-stimulated uptake of amino acids by liver was observed in adrenalectomized, hypophysectomized, thyroidectomized, or diabetic rats and could not be duplicated by pharmacological doses of a large variety of hormones. In addition, LEM stimulated an increased uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid by isolated livers during their perfusion in vitro. LEM also stimulated an increased incorporation of orotic acid into hepatic RNA of intact rats, especially into the bound ribosomal fraction. This increased synthesis of RNA preceded an enhanced hepatic production of a number of the acute-phase plasma globulins. LEM did not stimulate the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system in liver and was not found to utilize this system as a second messenger. Thus, the effects of LEM in stimulating hepatic amino acid transport appear to be direct, without mediation by other hormones, and to be independent of cAMP. On the other hand, the ability of LEM to stimulate RNA and acute phase globulin synthesis in liver may require the presence of physiological quantities of hormones such as adrenal corticoids.</AbstractText>"}

These effects are at least partially attributable to a cortisone-induced augmentation of the total B cell mass. Compared with the high degree of protection against alloxan-induced damage afforded the pancreatic B cells of cortisone-pretreated rabbits, the protective effect of cortisone against B cell destruction in streptozotocin-injected rats is thus much more limited in scope.

The proportion of cardiac output received by the kidney and organs of the gastrointestinal tract was increased in the diabetic animals. Tissue hyperplasia appeared to be largely responsible. Blood flow per unit weight was markedly increased in the fat tissue of diabetic rats but was reduced in that of the obese rats, indicating a positive relationship between fat mobilization and blood flow. Blood flow in the hindlimbs, tail, skin, and spleen were all reduced in at least one diabetic group. Most of the changes observed appeared to progress with the duration of diabetes. Possible hormonal and metabolic causes are discussed. Some of the experimental changes observed may form useful models for diabetic vasculopathy.</AbstractText>"}

The activity of acid proteinase was somewhat increased in the white matter but decreased in the gray matter of diabetic patients. No increase was observed in the activity of neutral proteinase in diabetic white and gray matter. The activities of beta-glucuronidase and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP) were of the same level as those of the controls. The activities of all 4 enzymes appeared to be increased in the diabetic nerve, with the possible exception of CNP which was measured from only 1 nerve. Furthermore, the amount of total protein was markedly decreased in diabetic peripheral myelin. The encephalitogenic basic protein of diabetic brain myelin was normal in the disc gel electrophoretic patterns of brain myelin proteins. However, the basic proteins of peripheral myelin were reduced in a number of diabetic patients. The present biochemical findings for diabetic white and gray matter were largely normal. Instead, the increased activities of at least the proteinases and beta-glucuronidase in diabetic peripheral nerve, together with the loss of basic proteins, indicate extensive biochemical damage of the peripheral nervous system in diabetes. They suggest that demyelination and other phenomena observed in diabetic peripheral nerve are not caused only by angiopathy and impaired circulation.</AbstractText>"}

The pathology is limited to specific areas such as the caudate nucleus, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. 14 patients with documented Huntington's disease (mean age of 44.4 years with a range of 27-79 years) were studied by oral glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and intravenous arginine tolerance tests performed under standardized metabolic conditions. Seven of the 14 patients had impaired carbohydrate tolerance. Mean plasma glucose level at 2h was 90.4+/-6.2 mg/100 ml in the patients with a normal GTT and 148.1+/-8.9 mg/100 ml in the patients with a diabetic type GTT. Mean peak insulin level in the nondiabetic group occurred at 1/2 h and was 60.2+/-10.1 muU/ml, but in the diabetic group the peak insulin level occurred at 2h and was 155.9+/-33.8 mgU/ml. There was failure of suppression of growth hormone during the GTT, with a rise to abnormally high levels at 5h (18.6+/-5.6 ng/ml). Arginine infusion resulted in normal glucose and insulin rise in the nondiabetic patients with Huntington's disease. However, arginine infusion provoked an elevated insulin response in those with a diabetic GTT, and an exaggerated growth hormone response in the majority of the patients. It is uncertain whether these observations are related to abnormal cerebral aging per se, direct hypothalamic neuronal degeneration, or perhaps a relative imbalance of intracerebral neurotransmitters including dopamine.</AbstractText>"}

Supplement","Date":"1977","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A short review is given on current aspects of the low-dose insulin therapy of diabetic ketoacidosis, and briefly on the other aspects of the treatment. Frequent intramuscular administration of low doses of regular insulin leads to plasma insulin concentrations, sufficient for maximal insulin biologic activity. The intravenous and subcutaneous routes of insulin administration are suitable as well in the low-dose insulin therapy. The author described results from a retrospective study comparing the efficacy of large and small insulin doses in the treatment of diabetic precoma and coma in children (1). The i.m. administration of insulin, 0.5 U/kg initially, followed by 0.25 U/kg at intervals of 1/2-3 hours led to as rapid disappearance of the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis as with previously used larger insulin doses. The tendency to hypoglycemia and hypokalemia was milder with the smaller insulin dose. With such a modified low-dose insulin therapy it is essential to initiate i.v. glucose administration rather early. The responsiveness to insulin may vary from one child to another, and infections may increase the need for insulin. Therefore, careful individual monitoring of the treatment is important even when using the low-dose insulin therapy.</AbstractText>"}

Dosage must be individualized with the help of mixing short- and longacting types of non-immunogenic insulin preparations. Procedures vary with the stage of the disease, whether at the onset of diabetes, during the remission period or thereafter. Rapid normalization of blood and urine sugar is recommended in the first stage, which may partly preserve beta cell function. After the first two years of diabetes practically all patients require insulin twice daily. To achieve satisfactory metabolic control in diabetic teenagers is difficult and requires an experienced team of paediatricians, nurses, dietitians, psychologists and teachers, as well as informed, motivated and cooperative patients.</AbstractText>"}

Sera were obtained before the start of treatment and at repeated intervals thereafter. Serum insulin antibodies were measured by three methods in three laboratories. Twenty-nine children were treated with R.I. (rare immunogenic) insulins at one department and 22 with MC (monocomponent) insulins at the other department. Before the start of treatment, serum insulin antibodies were almost invariably zero or below the limit of detection. During the first year a considerable number of cases, more than that reported for adults, formed detectable amounts of antibodies, and more so in the R.I. than in the MC series. The levels were however definitely lower than those observed with the same methods in diabetic children on conventional insulins. Analysis of variance showed no differences between the various age groups. No significant correlation was found between the highest titre of serum insulin antibodies on the one hand and insulin dose or glucosuria on the other hand. The results confirm the concept that children form antibodies to insulin more actively than adults.</AbstractText>"}

At a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight of N-nitrosomethylurea a triphasic blood glucose curve was recorded with an initial hyperglycaemic peak after 3 hours followed by a decrease at 6 hours. After 24 hours and during the following days the values were moderately elevated. There was a high mortality in the diabetic animals, about 80 per cent of them dying within one week. The approximate L.D. 50 of N-nitrosomethylurea injected intraperitoneally in non-fasting adult animals was about 125 mg/kg body weight at an observation time of 48 hours. On light microscopy, degenerative changes with nuclear pyknosis were seen after 3 hours in the pancreatic islet cells, followed by cellular disintegration. Both beta-, alpha2- and alpha1-cells were obviously affected. Pretreatment with 500 mg nicotinamide/kg body weight given intraperitoneally 10 minutes before the injection of N-nitrosomethylurea inhibited and hyperglycaemia and seemed to prevent the injurious effects of N-nitrosomethylurea on the islet cells. The results show that the glucose residue of the streptozotocin molecule is not necessary for the induction of diabetes in Chinese hamsters, but it seems to increase the selectivity of the toxic effects for the islet cells. This is a clear advantage in studies of experimental diabetes, especially when longer observation periods are desired.</AbstractText>"}

Corticosteroid excretion normalized with the compensation of diabetes, irrespective of the type of the sugar-reducing preparations.  A more pronounced increase in catecholamine excretion was seen in insulin therapy apparently in connection with greater variations in glycemia level.  A conclusion was drawn on analogous effect of insulin and sulphanilamides on the metabolic changes under study in diabetes.

Ketogenic response to medium-chain triglycerides.","Journal":"Diabetes","Date":"Mar 1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The clinical features of the experimental hyperosmolar diabetic (EHD) rat model resemble those seen in the human syndrome--extreme hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis is common to both. The absence of ketoacidosis in the syndrome has been ascribed to both substrate (free fatty acid) deficiency and to interference with hepatic ketone body synthesis. The potential for hepatic ketone body synthesis in the experimental model has been directly assessed by challenging the EHD animals with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) administered intragastrically. This neutral lipid, largely consisting of C8 and C10 fatty acids, leads to a dose- and thime-related increase in the plasma concentration of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. The EHD rats respond to MCT with an increase in plasma ketone bodies that rises to levels that are twice as high as those observed in normal rats receiving MCT and are equivalent to the levels seen in untreated ketoacidotic animals. These data indicate that hepatic medium-chain fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis are unimparied in the EHD animal. An analysis of the factors responsible for the greater ketogenic response in the EHD rat reveals that moderate diabetes and dehydration enhance MCT-induced ketone body accumulation, while cortisol is without effect. The plasma free fatty acid concentration in EHD animals does not differ from normal rats, but is significantly lower than that seen in diabetic ketoacidosis. These data support the concept that a principal reason for the absence of ketoacidosis in the EHD syndrome is the limitation in availiability of substrate, free fatty acids, for ketone body synthesis.</AbstractText>"}

Six to eight months later glomeruli showed mesangial thickening: IgG, IgM and C3 were seen in large quantities in the mesangium by immunofluorescent microscopy. Ten animals then had successful pancreatic transplantation resulting in normal glucose and insulin levels within one to three weeks. Biopsies obtained within the first two weeks following transplantation demonstrated a significant reduction in mesangial thickening and in mesangial staining for IgG, IgM and C3. Three to four weeks after transplantation C3 staining was no longer detected. A gradual reduction in mesangial IgG and IgM localization continued so that by nine weeks following islet transplantation only minimal staining for immunoglobulins was present. Although mesangial thickening was reduced, this abnormality could still be detected in most animals six to nine weeks after transplantation. Three rats showed improvement in glomerular morphology within two weeks despite persistent hyperglycemia. These rats had normal insulin levels at this time. Islet transplantation in inbred diabetic rats effectively returns glucose and insulin levels to normal and results in rapid regression of the light microscopic and immunopathologic glomerular lesions. These studies support the concept of reversible mesangial dysfunction in diabetic rats.</AbstractText>"}

However, tumor growth was reduced when daily doses of insulin were administered. Treatment with estrogen inhibited growth of the R3230AC carcinoma, either in diabetic rats or in intact animals simultaneously treated with insulin. The effects of insulin plus estrogen treatment appeared to be additive in causing inhibition of tumor growth. Tumors from diabetic rats showed few metabolic alterations as reflected by little or no changes in the activities of selected glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, and hexokinase, nor any striking changes in the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, representing the pentose phosphate pathway. A modest reduction in the ratio of utilization of (1-14C)glucose: (6-14C)glucose was seen in vitro by tumors from diabetic rats. It was concluded that insulin, along with estrogen and prolactin, should be considered as a hormonal factor that influences growth of this automonous, hormone-responsive adenocarcinoma.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetic atria were found to have reduced rates, increased forces of contraction and reduced sensitivity to the inotropic effects of noradrenaline, isoprenaline, tyramine and calcium. Positive chronotropic responses to tyramine were also reduced but those to noradrenaline and isoprenaline were increased suggesting that tyramine releasable stores of noradrenaline were reduced. Elevation of glucose concentration in the medium from 5.6 to 27 mM resulted in decrease of inotropic sensitivity to the agents used in both control and diabetic rat atria. Resting contractile force of control rat atria was reduced by the inclusion of either 22 mM 2-deoxyglucose, 10(-3) i.u. insulin ml-1 or 5 mM acetate in the medium. The rate was also reduced by medium containing 2-deoxyglucose but increased by insulin. 2-Deoxyglucose also reduced inotropic but increased chronotropic sensitivity to isoprenaline.

Drugs for diabetes in Northern Ireland, Norway and Sweden.","Journal":"European journal of clinical pharmacology","Date":"Feb 28 1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The consumption of insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs was measured at the gross sales level in Sweden and Norway and at the prescription level in Northern Ireland. 'Agreed daily doses'' were used as units of comparison, which defined as follows: insulin 40 I.U., tolbutamide 1 g, acetohexamide 500 mg etc. Consumption was expressed as the number of 'agreed daily doses'' per 1,000 inhabitants per day. This provided a rough estimate of the number of subjects for whom the drug had been prescribed per 1,000 population. The data were collected during the three months April-June 1971. Marked differences in the consumption of antidiabetic drugs were found between the three countries and also between areas within each country. The consumption of insulin was similar in Norway and Northern Ireland (3.5 and 3.9 agreed daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day), but almost twice as high in Sweden. In Norway much lower use was found in certain rural areas. The variation in the consumption of oral antidiabetic drugs was even more marked. Surprisingly, consumption was considerably higher in Sweden (15.8) than in the nearby Norway (7.3), and was even lower in Northern Ireland (4.3). The major use was of sulphonylureas, especially chlorpropamide. Within the countries there was marked regional variation in the choice of individual biguanides and sulphonylureas. The data are discussed in relation to such factors as the incidence of diabetes, the sole use of dietary treatment etc. It is concluded that studies in depth, which link the actual use of drugs by patients to diagnosis, diabetic symptoms and clinical outcome of treatment are necessary in order to explore the reasons behind the marked geographical differences and to define a rational drug policy. However, the methods described in the study may be used for early detection of gross national differences in drug utilization, the further investigation of which may reveal to be of great public health interest.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":164620,"Title":"Adaptive character of liver glucokinase.","Journal":"Molecular and cellular biochemistry","Date":"Feb 28 1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. Glucokinase is one of four glucose phosphorylating enzymes present in rat liver. Its distinctive features are a high K-m for glucose (high-K-m isozyme) and a rather narrow substrate specificity. In contrast, the other three enzymes, collectively called hexokinases or low-K-m isozymes, exhibit low K-m values for glucose and a wider substrate specificity. 2. Glucokinase is present in the liver os mammals (with some exceptions), amphibians and lower reptiles; It is absent from higher reptiles and birds. The presence or absence of glucokinase may represent an evolutionary adaptation to feeding habits and other physiological peculiarities. Differences in the immunological behavior and in the kinetic parameters of glucokinases from different taxa suggest the operation of divergent evolution. 3. The levels of glucokinase in rat liver depend strictly on the supply of carbohydrate in the diet. Glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase behave similarly, whereas other carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes depend on the provision of either protein or protein plus carbohydrate. Glucokinase decays with a half-life of 33 hr when rats are starved or fed a carbohydrate-free diet, and is induced by the administration of glucose. The adaptive character is not exhibited by all mammals, indicating evolutionary discrimination within the same class and even within the same single order Rodentia. Enzyme adaptation in the liver may partially explain the condition known as 'hunger diabetes'. 4. The endocrine system plays a paramount role in glucokinase adaptation, since insulin is essential for glucose-dependent glucokinase induction and, on the other hand, glucagon, catecholamines and cyclic AMP prevent the induction. Glucocorticoids and some pituitary hormones modulate the rate of induction. The mechanisms underlying the hormonal regulation of glucokinase levels are not well known. 5. The variations in liver glucokinase correspond to changes in the amount of enzyme protein as assessed by immunochemical titration. This fact agrees with the effects of inhibitors of protein synthesis on glucokinase induction. 6. An antiserum against rat glucokinase reacts with the enzyme from mammals and turtles but not with the amphibian enzyme. It does not react with low-K-m hexokinases from different sources. 7. The saturation function for glucose is sigmoidal in mammalian and amphibian glucokinases but not in glucokinase from lower reptiles. The Hill's coefficient is very constant with values about 1.6. The K0.5 (concentration for half saturation) values in the different species studied vary between 1.5 and 8 mM. These kinetic parameters may be considered as another adaptive feature aimed to give maximal efficiency to the liver uptake of glucose at the changeable concentrations in the blood resulting from variations in the amount of dietary glucose.</AbstractText>"}

Heparinoids are applied in acute experiment. A total of 37 subjects were examined--22 diabetics with adult type of diabetes, 10 clinically healthy subjects and 5 diabetics examined only with 500 ml physiologic salt solution. The same patients were examined with heparin as well for a comparison. Blood sugar, NEFA, lipolyzing activity, total lipids, total cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins, total phospholipids, triglycerides and endogenic heparin were determined prior to and post infusion introduction of heparinoids. The results reveal that heparinoids have two basic biochemical effects decrease blood sugar lever in diabetics and change the blood lipid fraction level. They depend on the structural peculiarities of the preparations. Heparinoids stimulate heparin activity as well, through which they realize their biochemical effect to a certain extent. The decreasing effect on blood sugar level of heparinoids is stronger as compared with heparin.</AbstractText>"}

This study has shown improvement in incidence of several complications, especially those related to infection and pyelonephritis, and urinary incontinence. Mortality rate has improved significantly and is likely due in great part to more comprehensive care of cardiovascular complications and control of infection. One can perhaps anticipate even further improvements in technique and results with the development of reliable fiberoptic instruments and improved lens systems which have been introduced to our institution since the period of time covered by this review.</AbstractText>"}

At 24 to 168 hours after the instillation of spores, these rabbits succumbed to diabetes or zygomycete infection, or both, and the possibility of a mixed infection with both fungus and P. carinii could not be ruled out on morphologic criteria alone. To resolve the dilemma, rabbit lung tissue was examined by the fluorescent antibody procedure with labeled P. carinii antibodies. The labeled antibodies did not stain structures that resembled P. carinii but stained P. carinii cells in control rat lung infected with this organism. Investigators should be aware of the difficulty that may arise in differentiating the cyst form of P. carinii from spores of some fungi. The direct fluorescent antibody procedure for P. carinii appears to be very useful for differentiating P. carinii cysts from fungal spores.</AbstractText>"}

This involves the use of electronic summation (signal averaging). Potentials were obtained and velocities calculated from all normal subjects examined. In patients with peripheral neuropathies it was often possible to obtain nerve velocities with signal amplitudes as low as 0·1 μV and these were often slower than those obtained from the normal subjects. The advantages and disadvantages of this method are discussed. It is of significant clinical value in that pure sensory nerve conduction velocities can be measured in the legs when this may be the only valuable parameter in the absence of motor involvement. In addition, investigation of neuropathies at an earlier stage of development and recovery may be facilitated. It is hoped that in the future this technique of obtaining low amplitude responses with an analogue averager can be incorporated with the more routine aspects of nerve conduction testing when clinically indicated.</AbstractText>"}

This infusion resulted in a 45 to 55 per cent decline in plasma insulin and glucagon. Plasma glucose initially fell by 20 to 25 mg per 100 ml, but later rose despite continuing hypoglucagonemia. After five hours, plasma glucose concentration was 40 to 50 mg per 100 ml higher than that observed with saline infusion (P less than 0.001). The degree of hyperglycemia and plasma insulin levels correlated inversely at completion of the infusion (P less than 0.01). In addition, somatostatin resulted in a fivefold increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate and a 40 to 45 per cent rise in branched-chain amino acids (P less than 0.005). Our findings suggest that glucagon is not essential for the development and maintenance of fasting hyperglycemia. Furthermore, accentuation by somatostatin of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and hyperaminoacidemia in maturity-onset diabetes argues against its use in patients with residual insulin secretion.</AbstractText>"}

Hepatic triglyceride levels were determined in the same animals. During the second 24-hr period after alloxan administration, severe ketoacidosis developed and triglyceride concentrations in the liver became markedly elevated. This finding was incompatible with the thesis that enhanced ketogenesis under circumstances of increased free fatty acid delivery to the liver requires diminished triglyceride synthesis. Plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were determined at each time point. Initial changes in plasma glucose, ketones, free fatty acids, and triglycerides were accompanied by a fall in insulin concentrations, but no change occurred in glucagon levels. However, concentrations of the latter hormone increased dramatically in the second 24 hr after alloxan treatment and probably contributed to the development of the extreme hyperglycemia observed during this time period.</AbstractText>"}

A single TIA placed the patient at greater risk for early infarction. Older age, male sex, and unreliability to take dangerous medication were risk factors for cerebral infarction. Anticoagulant therapy, older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, abnormal ECG, and poor surgical risk were factors for death. The increased mortality associated with anticoagulants was confined to the older age group. While white patients treated with antiplatelet-aggregating agents had a lower mortality than those treated otherwise, this was not true amont black patients.</AbstractText>"}

In the diabetic children, the immunofluorescent reaction was inhibited by preadsorption of serum to islet cells but was little affected by preadsorption to rat hepatocytes or erythrocytes or to acetone powders of various rat tissues, including pancreas. These results show that organ-specific, nonspecies-specific antibodies reactive with the cell surface of the islet cells can be present in serum from diabetic children, and provide an approach to investigation of immunopathological aspects of diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

Maternal fasting blood-glucose and mean blood-glucose in the third trimester correlated significantly with neonatal skinfold thickness. Skinfold measurement, when compared with a reference range for gestational age, may be a convenient way of assessing one effect of maternal diabetes on the fetus. Gluteal adipose-cell diameter was measured in 31 infants of diabetic mothers. The fattest babies had the largest adipose cells and there was a significant positive correlation between maternal fasting blood-glucose and neonatal adipose cell diameter. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in diabetic pregnancy fetal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinism stimulate increased triglyceride synthesis in adipose cells and enlargement of adipose cells and lead to an increase in fetal subcutaneous fat.</AbstractText>"}

From a diagnostic standpoint, particular emphasis should be placed upon the circumstances of onset which alone give any indication.

From a pathogenic standpoint, there are two dominant elements : disturbances in hepatic gluconeogenesis and changes in insulin secretion and in resistance to insulin. The physiopathology is dominated by the risk of hyperosmolarity. Hypoglycaemia occurs most frequently as the result of a manit fest error : too sudded interruption of carbohydrate supplies or two high dosage of exogenous insulin.</AbstractText>"}

Five members definitely have the disease, while in 4 subjects the condition is suspected. The five proven cases are a mother and her four children. All suffer from recurrent attacks of abdominal pain which started between the 8th and 20th year of life, and in all of them exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and pancreatic calcifications can be demonstrated. The mother has had diabetes mellitus since the age of 40 and 3 of the 4 children also have the disease, with age of onset between 15 and 29. In 3 patients insignificant traces of aminoacids could be detected in the urine. At 16 years one male patient had a pseudocyst of the pancreas surgically removed. All the others are treated conservatively. Reports on approximately 25 families with this disease have been published so far. The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. Typically, the clinical symptoms begin during childhood or early adolescent life. The pathogenesis is unknown. It is possible that an abnormal pancreatic juice is produced which causes the intracanalicular calcifications. The treatment is identical to that in the non-hereditary forms, i.e. generally conservative. Recently some authors have favored a more aggressive approach consisting of pancreatico-jejunostomy or partial resection of the pancreas.</AbstractText>"}

Most obese subjects, however, are only slightly overweight and their mortality is not elevated. Reasons for dieting are more often psychological than somatic. 2. Reducing diets are ineffective because the obese rarely follow them. Total fasting and intestinal bypass may provide better results, but are more dangerous. 3. Atkins' diet eliminates carbohydrates from food without restricting protein and fat intake. Deprived of carbohydrates, the body uses fat for fuel. A small part of metabolized fat is eliminated in the urine as ketone bodies, and this is why such diets are called 'ketogenic'. They have been known at least since 1863. 4. Caloric loss due to ketonuria does not exceed 100 Cal/day in the non-diabetic. It is maximal during total fasting and cannot be increased by a ketogenic diet. 5. In the short run, such diets produce rapid weight loss due to polyuria. On the other hand, refeeding carbohydrates causes water retention and weight gain. 6. The diet decreases appetite: patients eat less without feeling severe hunger and without measuring their food intake. 7. Orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, and nausea are frequent, despite what Dr. ATKINS claims. 8. The diet increases plasma cholesterol and uric acid. It may be dangerous in diabetes (anorexia, acidosis) and in heart or kidney failure (hypokalemia). 9. The diet, though far from good, is better than the book. ATKINS' theories are at best half-truths, and the results he claims lack credibility. The obese subject's disappointment with traditional reducing diets and the book's hard-sell style account for ATKINS' success.</AbstractText>"}

EHDP significantly increased mean Pi (diabetics: 1.18 to 1.67 mmol/l, p less than 0.01, controls: 1.03 to 1.71 mmol/l, p less than 0.02) and P50 at in vivo pH of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (diabetics: 25.4 to 26.6 mmHg, p less than 0.02; controls: 26.3 to 28.9 mmHg, p less than 0.02). Pi and P50 were correlated in both diabetics and in controls (p less than 0.05). 2,3-DPG increased when the diabetics were on EHDP (p less than 0.005). The study emphasizes the importance of Pi on red cell function and indicates that an elevation of Pi tends to counteract the defect in oxygen release capacity of the red cells in diabetic subjects.</AbstractText>"}

The studies were performed on 11 primigravid patients with a gestational age of 38-40 weeks during the first stage of labor. Glucose was given intravenously by a bolus injection of 330 mg/kg body weight, followed by a glucose infusion of 27.5 mg/kg/min for 60 min. Glucose concentration, immuno-reactive insulin (IRI), pH and base excess of the maternal and fetal blood were measured before and during maternal glucose load. Maternal blood glucose rose within 10 min. up to 280.0 mg% (SD 25.9). This level could be fairly maintained throughout the experiment. The maternal glucose was after 60 min. infusion 326.5 mg% (SD 46.9). Fetal glucose concentration rose continuously from 65.8 mg% (SD 5.8) at control to 249.2 mg% (SD 23.3) after 60 min. The increase of maternal and fetal glucose was associated with an elevation of immuno-reactive insulin (IRI). The maternal insulin was 24.0 micronU/ml (SD 8.0). It was scattered over a wide range (55.4 micronU/ml-217.1 micronU/ml) after 60 min. glucose infusion. The fetal insulin was 17.0 micronU/ml (SD 5.2) at control and rose by 86.5% (SD 80.5) after 60 min. glucose load. One case of a mother with a subclinical diabetes mellitus deviated where the fetal insulin rose from 26.0 micronU/ml at control to 215.6 micronU/ml after 60 min. infusion. The increase of insulin per glucose rise was correlated to fetal body weight. During glucose infusion to the mother of both, fetal and maternal, acid base parameters remained unchanged. From these observations it may be concluded that in the human fetus insulin secretion following a single glucose load is generally low, however, it increases in cases where the maternal insulin response to glucose load is abnormal. This might be related to a chronic stimulation by glucose of the fetal pancreatic islet cells in poorly controlled diabetic and possibly prediabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

This case was unusual as it was associated with insulin-requiring diabetes, type IV hyperlipemia, hypercalciuria and renal calculi. He also demonstrated the previously described fructose-induced defect of urine acidification. Glucagon and C-peptide assays showed that the pancreatic alpha cells were stimulated by fructose and that the beta cells did not respond to fructose. It is not known whether the latter was due to his diabetes or to the lack of a beta cell response to this sugar. Primed 14C-glucose infusions were used for the first time to study nonsteady state glucose kinetics in man. They showed that, 24 hours after the last insulin injection and under basal conditions, the glucose concentrations increased because glucose production exceeded glucose utilization. However, after the administration of sorbitol the plasma glucose concentration decreased because glucose production decreased. After the administration of sorbitol there was no change in the metabolic clearance of glucose. This reflects the lack of a peripheral insulin effect and is consistent with the lack of any measurable C-peptide. Glucose utilization also decreased, but this decrease was less than the decrease in glucose production. Because the metabolic clearance of glucose remained unchanged, it was concluded that the change in glucose utilization was solely due to the decrease in glucose concentration. The absence of C-peptide in the plasma indicated that changes in glucose turnover were not related to any changes in endogenous plasma insulin. Furthermore, the plasma glucagon concentration increased and, hence, changes in this hormone could not account for the decrease in glucose production. Therefore, it was concluded that the sorbitol-induced decline in glucose production was due to a direct effect on hepatic metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

Five hours after insulin had been given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis developed. This could not be attributed to gastrointestinal loss of bacarbonate, ingestion of HCI or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, or the administered fluids and electrolytes. The combination of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and a urine pH of 5.6 during acidemia prompted specific studies that established the presence of disorders of renal acidification. A transient defect of hydrogen ion secretion in the distal nephron was suggested by the decrease in urine-blood Pco-2 gradient after administration of sodium bicarbonate. Proximal renal tubular acidosis was indicated by the reduced bicarbonate threshold that persisted for approximately 7 weeks.</AbstractText>"}

The most accentuated disturbances were seen in hyperlipoproteinemia type II and in diabetes mellitus comprising increase of fibrinogen content, platelet reduction and enhanced platelet aggregability, hypofibrinolysis. Only minor differences of certain clotting factors could be detected comparing diabetes mellitus and hyperlipoproteinemia type II. Diabetes mellitus being complicated by micro- or macroangiopathia revealed additional significant alterations such as more pronounced increase of fibrinogen, further platelet reduction and aggregability. Increase of fibrinogen, platelt disturbances, hypofibrinolysis and alterations of antithrombin activity in connection with metabolic diseases may be regarded as additional risk to vascular complications.</AbstractText>"}

Sigmoidal kinetics explained by the activity of glucokinase alone.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Aug 15 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate in an extract of isolated rat hepatocytes incubated in the presence of MgATP was studied spectrophotometrically at 340nm and also by a radiochemical procedure based on the release of (3)H from [2-(3)H]glucose. Both methods gave similar results. The glucose-saturation curve was sigmoidal and the shape of this curve was not influenced by the ionic composition of the incubation medium. The activity at 0.5mm-glucose was only 1-2% of V(max.), indicating a virtual absence of low-K(m) hexokinase in the preparation. The radiochemical method was also used for the determination of glucose phosphorylation by intact hepatocytes. The glucose-saturation curve was also markedly sigmoidal, but the s(0.5) (substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity) and the Hill coefficient were larger than in extracts of hepatocytes. These two parameters became smaller when cells were incubated in a medium in which Na(+) ions were replaced by K(+) ions. The increased rate of phosphorylation at low glucose concentration in a K(+) medium was accompanied by an increased rate of metabolite recycling between glucose and glucose 6-phosphate and also by an increased uptake of glucose. In both media phosphorylation of glucose was inhibited co-operatively by N-acetylglucosamine. Calculations indicate that this inhibition would reach 100% at saturation of the inhibitor, although at lower concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine it was smaller than expected from the known K(i) of N-acetylglucosamine for glucokinase. The rate of phosphorylation of glucose was proportional to the amount of glucokinase in hepatocytes from newborn rats and in conditions such as starvation and diabetes in which the total amount of glucokinase in the liver is decreased. In the same conditions, glucose 6-phosphatase activity was either normal or increased. It is concluded that the phosphorylation of glucose in isolated hepatocytes follows sigmoidal kinetics, which can be explained by the activity of glucokinase alone with no participation of low-K(m) hexokinase or of glucose 6-phosphatase.</AbstractText>"}

The minimal transport capacity for conjugated bile salts in the jejunum did not differ between diabetic and control intestine. D-galactose transport and transport of 3-0-methyl-glucose were, however, enhanced in diabetic jejunum as well. Kinetic analysis of the initial uptake rates for conjugated bile salts revealed that the maximal transport capacity (Vmax) was enhanced in diabetic ileum.

Hepatocytes from these animals were also examined by electron microscopy and subjected to quantitative morphometric analysis. The results indicated that the two populations of hepatic ribosomes respond differently to acute insulin deficiency. There was an overall reduction (P &lt; 0.001) in total number of bound ribosomes per volume cytoplasm: the remaining bound ribosomes underwent a shift to smaller-sized ribosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) aggregates (P &lt; 0.02); and the proteinsynthetic activity of these bound ribosomes was less than normal (P &lt; 0.02) when protein synthesis was directed by endogenous mRNA. However, there was no difference between bound ribosomes from livers of normal and diabetic rats when protein synthesis was directed by polyuridylic acid. In contrast, free ribosomes were unchanged in number and degree of ribosomal mRNA aggregation, but displayed a significantly increased rate of in vitro protein synthesis (P &lt; 0.01) as compared to normal controls. This increased protein-synthetic activity occurred when amino acid incorporation was directed by endogenous mRNA or polyuridylic acid. These changes in structure and function of bound and free hepatic ribosomes were prevented by the concomitant administration of insulin. The decrease in protein-synthetic activity of bound hepatic ribosomes from acutely diabetic rats seems to be secondary to marked disruption and disaggregation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) with production of smaller ribosomal mRNA aggregates which incorporate less amino acids into protein. Increased protein synthetic activity of free ribosome appears to be related to the ability of these ribosomes to copy mRNA more efficiently.</AbstractText>"}

The amino acid composition of the normal GBM revealed the presence of significant amounts of hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, glycine, and carbohydrate suggesting the presence of a collagen-like protein. There was no significant increase in the amount of hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, or in the hydroxylysine-linked glycoside glucosyl-galactose in the diabetic kidneys. There was, however, a significant decrease in the cystine and sialic acid content of GBM from diabetic kidneys. It was further shown that the alpha-chains isolated from the collagens of normal and diabetic basement membranes had similar amino acid and carbohydrate compositions. The hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, glycine, and hexose contents were higher by 82, 56, 74, and 94%, respectively in the alpha-chains compared with the intact basement membranes from both the normal and diabetic kidneys. The results indicate that the slight increases in hydroxylysine and hexose content observed occasionally in diabetic GBM preparations are of no statistical significance and cannot be attributed to increases in the activities of enzymes which hydroxylate lysine or glycosylate hydroxylysine, respectively.</AbstractText>"}

Particulate fractions of costal cartilage from young rats are capable of catalyzing the formation of the first two monosaccharide units of the chondroitin sulfate-protein linkage region. 2. Hormonal imbalance has been shown to influence the activity of the glycosyltransferases responsible for the sequential transfer of xylose and galactose from UDPxylose and UDPgalactose, respectively, in the formation of the linkage region. 3. The activity of xylosyltransferase was found to be decreased in costal cartilage of diabetic, thyroidectomized and hypophysectomized rats, but not in rats injected with either testosterone or hydrocortisone. In the latter two treatment groups, galactosyltransferase activity was decreased only in the group receiving hydrocortisone. 4. The combined results of this and previous studies suggest that decreased levels of chondroitin sulfate in diabetic, thyroidectomized and hypophysectomized animals are due to interference in the synthesis of the linkage region of the proteoglycan at the xylosyltransferase level whereas hydrocortisone acts primarily at the level of the galactosyltransferase.</AbstractText>"}

The concentration of cyclic AMP in epididymal adipose tissue was increased approximately 2 1/2-fold 24 h after alloxan administration and up to 7-fold 72 h post-alloxan. Treatment of alloxan-diabetic rats with insulin for 4 h completely suppressed lipolysis but only partially suppressed cyclic AMP levels; 6 h following insulin treatment cyclic AMP levels were normal. When segments of the epididymal fat bodies were incubated in vitro the high cyclic AMP levels were not maintained but instead decreased spontaneously. Addition of insulin to the incubation media decreased lipolysis in tissues of diabetic rats to levels measured in tissues of normal rats and accelerated the decline in cyclic AMP levels but did not return cyclic AMP levels to normal. Rats rendered acutely insulin deficient by injection of anti-insulin serum showed increased plasma glucose and free fatty acid levels and increased adipose tissue free fatty acid, and cyclic AMP levels 30 min following injection of the antiserum. Plasma glucagon levels increased but not until 2 h following anti-insulin serum, thereby excluding the possibility that an increment in plasma glucagon is the primary stimulus for the acceleration of lipolysis in diabetes. These data are consistent with the view that control of adipose tissue cyclic AMP levels in situ is an important physiologic action of insulin.</AbstractText>"}

On gel filtration the receptor elutes as a single peak with a Stokes radius of 72 A. Preincubation of the receptor with low levels of insulin leads to the formation of a second, smaller form with a Stokes radius of 40 A. The percent of receptor in this second peak is proportional to the insulin concentration and correlates well with the insulin-induced increase in dissociation rate (negative cooperativity). Both the isolated high molecular weight and the isolated low-molecular-weight forms of the receptor re-equilibrate in the presence of insulin and, upon refiltration of either isolated peak, both forms of the receptor are obtained. These results are compatible with a model of the insulin receptor in which a tetrameric form can dissociate to a monomeric form as a concomitant of negative cooperativity.</AbstractText>"}

The obstetric patient most likely to deliver a large birthweight infant was characterized. Toxemia, prolonged labor, and puerperal morbidity occurred with increased frequency. Many of the deliveries were complicated by fetopelvic disproportion with resultant increase in mid-forceps deliveries, cesarean sections, and perinatal morbidity. Five of the 517 patients delivering large birthweight infants were known to have diabetes mellitus prior to the pregnancy included in this study. An additional 369 patients were evaluated with intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Thirty-eight (10.3%) of the 369 tested proved to have diabetic glucose tolerance curves. The likelihood of finding maternal diabetes mellitus increased with the infant's birthweight. Multiple regression analysis of other clinical variables failed to predict which patients would prove to have diabetes. Identification of diabetic puerperas requires that glucose tolerance tests be performed in all who delivered large birthweight infants.</AbstractText>"}

The steps involved included atrial level transection and anastomosis, local myocardial hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass. From the first Stanford clinical case in January 1968 until May 1974, 73 transplants have been carried out in 71 patients. Cardiac transplantation is indicated in myopathic disease of an advanced nature with the prospect of imminent death. Contraindications are high pulmonary vascular resistance and intercurrent infection. Relative contraindications are advanced age and insulin-dependent diabetes. Previous cardiac surgery procedures are not contraindications to transplantation. Maintenance immunosuppression requires azathioprine and prednisone indefinitely. Antithymocyte globulin is used for a short time in the postoperative period. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are also used. Therapy for rejection crises includes methylprednisolone, in gram amounts, and actinomycin D. The diagnosis of graft rejection is based on a decrease in electrocardiographic voltage, transvenous endomyocardial biopsy and clinical examination of the patient. The overall survival rate is 43% at one year and 39% at two years. The longest-living survivor in the series is doing a regular day's work five years after transplantation.</AbstractText>"}

Essential for the development of lactic acidosis seems to be the preexistence or the acute development of renal insufficiency. However, the over-dosage (for instance in the case of attempted suicide) causes acidosis (lactic acidosis) in healthy persons also. Using the experimental animal lactic acidosis is demonstrated following biguanide application. Diagnosis of lactic acidosis is substantiated by acidosis with lactic acid concentrations higher than 8-10 meq/l (= 72-90mg/100 ml) and with considerably increased lactate/pyruvate ratios (50-150). Generally a non ketotic acidosis of diabetic patients (especially under biguanide-therapy) should be considered to be a lactic acidosis. On the other hand the existence of lactic acid concentrations higher than 8-10 meq/l ist characteristic for a lactic acidosis. The prognosis of lactic acidosis induced by biguanides is not too good. Therapy of the acidosis using bicarbonate is not sufficient in most cases. The intravenous application of glucose (or glucose substitutes), perhaps with additional insulin, might be indicated by hypoglycemia. However, this therapy might cause an additional increase in lactic acid concentration. Treatment of choice might be dialysis, effecting the elimination of the biguanides. If peritoneal dialysis is performed acetate containing solutions should be used. Biguanide induced lactic acidosis is prevented by a very cautious selection of patients suited for biguanide therapy. The performance of renal function tests is absolutely necessary if therapy with biguanides is intended. Additionally, periodical control of renal function is required in patients treated with biguanides (at least twice a year). Biguanide therapy should be performed only with extreme caution, because decrease in renal function is very common in older patients.</AbstractText>"}

Of 112 patients operated on for intracranial arterial aneurysm (microsurgical approach), four patients (3.6%) showed DI in the postoperative period. In 3 cases of these 4, the aneurysms located on the anterior communicating artery and the remaining one was the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. 2. The exact mechanism of occurrence of DI is obscure. We suppose that not only vascular spasm of branches of the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries supplying to the paraventricular and preoptic nucleus, but also surgical trauma with direct tissue injury might explain the symptoms. 3. All patients showed a monophasic type of DI which started 1 to 4 days after surgery and lasted from 6 up to 9 days. 4. Two patients with DI showed decreased plasma ADH values below 0.6 microunits/ml in the few days prior to the appearance of abnormally large amount of urinary output.

Four patients showed a definite TSH response to ITT. They were 2 patients with suspected pinealoma with diabetes insipidus (DI), a patient with pituitary adenoma and a patient with acute prophyria. A suspected hypothalamic dysfunction and a slightly impaired pituitary function manifested as GH deficiency were their common endocrinological features. On the contrary, plasma PRL response to ITT was noted in about one third of the patients examined, but no concomitant PRL response was observed in any of the patients with a definite TSH response. This suggested a different mechanism of TSH and PRL secretion may be different under this circumstance and a certain factor related to the hypothalamic disorder may play a modulating role in an unusual TSH response to hypoglycemia in these particular patients.</AbstractText>"}

The results are compared with criteria from a group of healthy persons without any heredity of diabetes worked out in our laboratory. In about 66 per cent of the investigated subjects a concordance between both tests could observed in carbohydrate tolerance. Abnormal results were found more frequently after the oral glucose application. From these finding it was concluded a higher sensitivity of the oGTT. On the other hand followup studies of the disagreed diagnosis have shown that in 91 per cent the test results of the GIT were reproduced. The insulin secretion pattern agreed in 70 per cent between both tests. Whereas the insulin secretion pattern during the oGTT does not allowed to differ between the groups using the glucose infusion test we were able to observe a significant diminished hormone release in the initial as well as in the late phases, if the carbohydrate tolerance was pathologically.

In contrast, the non-specific inflammatory response to oxazolone is not impaired in insulin-deficient mice. Further experiments have shown that neither sensitized lymphocytes of control animals given to diabetic mice, nor sensitized lymphocytes of diabetic mice injected into normoglycaemic recipients, were able to transfer passively any significant contact sensitivity.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of the different fiber types to hypertrophy in muscles from diabetic rats, which should further clarify the apparent differential trophic influence of insulin on the fibers. One group of rats was injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. The gastrocnemius muscle was then removed from one hindlimb of rats of both the diabetic and a second, normal group, resulting in compensatory growth of ipsilateral plantaris muscle. Rats were sacrificed 60 days following the surgery. Experimental muscles in normal and diabetic rats enlarged 79% and 61% over control muscles, respectively. In normal hypertrophied muscles there was an 8% increase in relative cross-sectional area composed of slow-twitch fibers, whereas in diabetic rats the slow-twitch component increased 17%. The results indicate that slow-twitch fibers in diabetic rats were capable of responding to the chronic power overloaded condition, but that the fast-twitch fibers had a reduced capacity to undergo compensatory growth. These findings support our previous observations suggesting that insulin may exert a differential trophic effect upon the muscle fiber types.</AbstractText>"}

Still birth was twice as frequent as neonatal death, and severe respiratory distress syndrome was uncommon, resulting in only one death. Bad control of diabetes was associated with a poor prognosis. This was contributed to be lack of cooperation, anxiety and poor knowledge of diabetes. The accurate assessment of gestation and maturity, the monitoring of fetal-placental function, careful blood glucose level control, and an understanding of neonatal physiology have contributed to a reduction in fetal mortality. Close cooperation between an obstetrician, physician and neonatal pediatrician experienced in the problems encountered in the management of pregnant diabetic women is essential if the best results are to be obtained.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetes mellitus: the most striking observations are small, extremely electron dense mitochondria and a lot of intracellular filaments in a hydropic cytoplasm. Rh-incompatibility: according to the stage of placental damage the Langhans cells show a different structure. In light cases we find hydrolic cells with normal mitochondria as well as swollen ones. The plasmalemm shows a lot of foldings and dentations with the syncytium. In serious cases of rh-incompatibility the Langhans cells cover the trophoblastic basal membrane completely. Their electron density is even higher than that of the syncytium. Characteristic lysosomes appear. In the most serious cases the syncytium is completely destroyed and maximal hydropic Langhans cells cover the villi. EPH-gestosis: the Langhans cells show different phases of differentiation, but no other characteristic criteria. The importance of the Langhans cells for the regeneration of the syncytotrophoblast is discussed. Mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum are obviously not formed in the syncytium but they must be regenerated by taking up Langhans cells by syncytial fusion.</AbstractText>"}

The family doctor had to be informed in nearly 70 per cent of the men and about 60 per cent of the women because of at least one suspicious symptom or sign. There was a pathological value of glucose in the urine in 14.7 per cent, a rise of glucose in the blood (above 113 mg per cent) in 5.7 per cent, of triglicerides (above 181 mg per cent) in 12.6 per cent, of cholesterol (above 264 mg per cent) in 15.4 per cent, of uric acid (male above 7.7 mg per cent, female above 7.1 mg per cent) in 6.8 per cent, of creatinine (above 1.3 mg per cent) in 6.4 per cent and the presence of albumin in urine in 2.2 per cent of the cases.</AbstractText>"}

In the absence of invasive infection, forefoot perfusion pressure is the single most important factor in determining outcome of minor amputation. At ankle pressures of less than 35 mm. Hg, salvage of the foot appears to be futile. The presence or absence of diabetes mellitus has no noticeable effect on the result of amputation. Ankle systolic pressure measurement cannot supplant but should supplement clinical judgement in selecting surgical treatment for gangrene.</AbstractText>"}

Initial administration of bicarbonate appears to be beneficial in preventing the deleterious effects of prolonged severe acidosis, such as cardiac arrhythmias, shock or acute pulmonary edema. Furthermore, partial correction of acidosis decreases the total dose of insulin necessary to compensate hyperglycemia and thereby reduces the danger of late hypoglycemia. This treatment calls for frequent checks on acid-base status and serum potassium. In most cases hypokalemia develops, but can be easily corrected by administration of potassium chloride. Normalization of arterial pH by bicarbonate infusion is not recommended in view of the development of late hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis.</AbstractText>"}

The study was carried out in 19 women with diabetes and/or high risk - 5 were on insulin, 6 had asymptomatic, latent or potential diabetes and 8 were obeses. In the insulin dependent group, no changes were seen in blood glucose levels. Insulin doses were the same before and during treatment. In the asymptomatic diabetes group, no modification in carbohydrate metabolism occured. Glucose tolerance tests which were abnormal before treatment became normal under treatment. This finding is discussed. In the obese group, carbohydrate tolerance remained normal during treatment. The low dose of ethinyloestradiol in this 'pill' is probably responsible for the absence of diabetogenic side-effects. It would thus appear possible to use such an oral contraceptive in diabetics (overt or asymptomatic) when necessary. However the customary regular surveillance is required.</AbstractText>"}

In the insulin-dependent group I.C.A. were found in 85% of patients immediately after the onset of symptoms and they became less common as the duration of disease increased I.C.A. were equally common in both sexes and the decline in their prevalence was independent of age. The antibodies were directed against cytoplasmic components of islet cells but not against insulin itself. The appearance of I.C.A. probably follows cell damage occurring before the onset of symptoms. By contrast, thyroid and gastric autoantibodies were more common in older patients and females. There was no correlation between the presence of these antibodies and I.C.A. in patients with either diabetes of recent onset or longstanding disease.</AbstractText>"}

There were 3 cases (25%) who could not be decided as having brain tumor during the follow-up period of more than 6 years. 2) There was one case who developed the overt signs of brain tumor 9 years after the onset of diabetes insipidus. Therefore, it seems necessary to follow-up cases with diabetes insipidus for at least 10 years before determining it as idiopathic type. 3) In cases with diabetes insipidus due to brain tumor, associated growth retardation, autonomic symptoms, behavior disorder, endocrine dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction were frequently observed. In the case where these symptoms become aggravated with lapse of time, these findings should be taken seriously as indicating brain tumor. 4) In the case showing either anterior or posterior focal slow waves in the EEG, if such focal slow waves aggravate with age, the findings should be considered as indicative of brain tumor. 5) We would like to emphasize the significance of brain tumor as the underlying pathology of childhood diabetes insipidus.</AbstractText>"}

Normal subjects showed a significant mean fall in glucagon at 15, 30, and 60 min, with a return to the baseline at 120 min. Maturity-onset diabetics showed a significant mean rise 15 min after oral glucose. The mean of the twin group was intermediate between normals and diabetics, although there was considerable individual variation with some showing suppression and others stimulation of glucagon release. When the twins were divided according to the length of discordance it was found that the mean response in the 8 twins who had been discordant for a mean of 19 years was indistinguishable from that of normal subjects, whereas the mean response of twins discordant for a mean of only 4.5 years was similar to that of the diabetic patients. It is possible, therefore, that hypersecretion of glucagon may occur in some subjects predisposed to develop diabetes mellitus, and the finding of lack of suppression of glucagon in the identical twin of a juvenile diabetic may be of prognostic significance. Identical twins who have been discordant for over 10 years are thought on other grounds to be unlikely to develop diabetes, and the finding of a normal glucagon response is further confirmation of their normal metabolic status and reinforces the suggestion that they are not prediabetic.</AbstractText>"}

The study concerned 161 diabetics in the age between 3-18, and 50 non-diabetic children in the same age. There is no significant difference between diabetics and control-group in the frequency of symptoms, described in literature as early signs of microangiopathy, as multiple capillary-, and peripapillary-filling and early venous dilatation. Increased capillary filling was found at anxious children with strained cervical muscles during the examination. In 54% of the 161 diabetic patients-negative by ophthalmoscopy,-solitary or multiple microaneurysms were found fluorescence angiographically. The increase of number of the microaneurysms is correlated to the duration of the diabetics and advance in age. In the authors opinion the presence of microaneurysms is in some cases due to genetic factors and is independent from the metabolic changes of diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The ophthalmological investigation did not indicate a systemic disease. The neurological findings, however, revealed a systemic disorder in many cases.-The constitutions of 20 patients (52.5%) were marked by pathological stigmata. The EEG was abnormal in more than 50% of the cases. The EMG showed a prolonged nerve conduction time for 2 of a total of 4 deaf patients. The EMG also revealed a patient with both pigmentary degeneration of the retina and a mold form of myasthenia gravis. The biochemical results indicated hyperlipoproteinemia in 6 cases (15.8%), diabetes mellitus in 2 cases and a pathological increase of uric acid in the serum in 8 cases. These results suggest that pigmentary degeneration of the retina is not a homogenous disease. It must be seen as a 'phenomenologically identical, polygenetic type of reaction' (Janzen). A comprehensive analysis of the individual case can therefore lead to implications which are of direct therapeutic significance.</AbstractText>"}

Similar studies were carried out in 6 maturity onset diabetics who had failed to respond to sulphonylureas and 6 new insulin requiring diabetics. In the chlorpropamide treated patients there was an initial fall in serum and VLDL triglyceride but this effect was lost at 12 months. There was no change in fractional triglyceride removal. At 12 months there was a fall in LDL and a rise in HDL choelsterol. An initial improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin secretion was maintained at 12 months. In the insulin treated group the initial fall in serum and VLDL triglyceride was maintained at 12 months and was accompanied by an increase in fractional triglyceride removal. There was also a fall in LDL and a rise in HDL cholesterol at 12 months. The failure of chlorpropamide to maintain the reduction in serum and VLDL triglyceride could be of importance in the genesis of coronary heart disease in maturity onset diabetics. The fall in LDL and rise in HDL cholesterol found both with chlorpropamide and insulin might be beneficial.</AbstractText>"}

In 1 patient with obstructive jaundice, severe diabetes and a previous history of biliary pain traditional ERC failed. An endoscopic artificial choledocho-duodenal fistula by means of a diathermic cutter (needle type) was performed at the lower end of the intramural portion of the common bile duct for retrograde cholangiography. X-ray showed an obstruction of the common bile duct due to a carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Complications did not occur during the procedure and in the post-operative period. It is concluded that the described method may be helpful when traditional selective ERC fails, moreover it may permit an endoscopic choledocho-duodenostomy for choledocholithiasis in cases of unsuccessful endoscopic papillo-sphincterotomy.</AbstractText>"}

Individually, aminotransferase assays did not provide good discrimination among the various categories of hepatobiliary disease, but when expressed as a ratio a useful degree of discrimination was obtained. Isocitrate dehydrogenase, guanase and glutamate dehydrogenase alone were poor discriminants of the various disease categories studied; combination of the latter enzyme with the aminotransferases in various ratios did not achieve worthwhile improvement. Adenosine deaminase was normal in most patients with extrahepatic obstruction and abnormal in most patients with parenchymal hepatic disease, and is potentially a useful test additional to the aminotransferases in routine diagnosis. 5'-Nucleotidase was more sensitive and specific than alkaline phosphatase in diagnosing hepatobiliary disorders. Abnormalities of all these enzymes were encountered in patients who did not have hepatobiliary disease, most frequently among subjects with cancer, diabetes mellitus, and diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.</AbstractText>"}

The patterns were similar for the study subjects and for healthy subjects of the same age. The psychogeriatric patients with diabetes in contrast to psychogeriatric patients with chronic hypoglycemia, showed an increase in body weight and blood pressure and increase in blood sugar concentration with ageing; they also showed a normal EEG whereas chronically hypoglycemic patients usually had an abnormal EEG. In terms of blood glucose levels and excess glucose in the urine despite treatment, the diabetes had to be considered uncontrolled. However, these patients were clinically asymptomatic. Apparently, in these particular circumstances, the diabetes may be an adaptive biologic phenomenon.</AbstractText>"}

The results showed that patients with mild or no retinopathy had significantly increased volume flow compared with normals, those with moderate retinopathy had a slight but not significant increase and those with severe retinopathy had blood flow similar to that found in normals. The mean transit time was reduced significantly in those with mild or no retinopathy, but was similar to normals in those with moderate and severe retinopathy.

The highest degree of diagnostic agreement was obtained with the following limits: a) blood glucose greater than or smaller than or equal to 120 mg/100 ml within 2 1/2 h after a 100 g OGTT together with b) a k-value of greater than or smaller than or equal to  1.05 as a limit for a 25 g IVGTT and c) a 30 min blood glucose level as percentage of fasting of greater than or smaller than or equal to 77 as limit for a 1 g IVTT. Using these criteria the three tests deemed the same subjects either diabetic or nondiabetic in about 2/3 of the cases. The best correlation between the blood glucose values of the OGTT and the k-values of the IVGTT and the 30 min values of the IVTT was obtained using the blood glucose concentrations of the last part of the OGTT. The 2 and the 3 hr values were however equal to the 2 1/2 hr values with regard to the degree of correlation with the values of the intravenous test. The results indicated that the diagnostic disagreement reported previously between the three tests may partly be due to the use of blood glucose values in the first part of the OGTT for the classification of the test and partly due to the screening limits chosen for interpretation of the three test.</AbstractText>"}

Socioeconomic status was determined by scoring the census tract of patient residence with such variables as median family income, housing status, etc. Many frequently performed surgical procedures had similar rates for the high, middle, low, and poverty socioeconomic groups. Procedures performed more frequently on the poverty than on the high SES group were tonsillectomy and upper gastrointestinal, heart, hemorrhoid, and cataract procedures. Dental procedures were performed more frequently on the high SES group. The over-all rate of hospital admissions showed a steady decline from the rate of 156 per 1,000 for the poverty census tracts to 104 for the high SES census tracts. This trend was reflected in the admission rates for several conditions requiring primary medical management, such as infections, diabetes, and skin problems. The population-based frame of reference used in this study can be a useful tool for raising pertinent questions for both professional standards review organizations and health planning groups.</AbstractText>"}

Somatostatin reduced blood-xylose levels by 50-90% after ingestion of this pentose and delayed the peak increment in blood-xylose by 1-2 h. Similar effects on blood-xylose levels and a 30% reduction in splanchnic blood-flow were observed in normal subjects during infusion of somatostatin. Glucagon administration (3 ng per kg per min) or intraduodenal administration of xylose did not reverse somatostatin's effect on xylose tolerance. Somatostatin reduces postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetes primarily by decreasing and/or delaying carbohydrate absorption rather than enhancing carbohydrate disposal. This effect may be mediated, in part, but a reduction in splanchnic blood-flow. These findings indicate that postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetes is due primarily to insulin deficiency rather than glucagon excess.</AbstractText>"}

It is, however, difficult to obtain a differential diagnosis. One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail.

The frequency seems to increase with age and in women who had earlier shown hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. A failure in the feedback mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is suggested to be an important factor in the etiology of hypertension induced by oral contraceptives. Usually, blood pressure returns to normal after cessation of treatment with contraceptive steroids; on the other hand, some cases of irreversible hypertension and kidney failure have been described. Besides the measurement of blood pressure before any treatment with hormonal contraceptives is started, blood pressure should be controlled after three months. In the differential diagnosis of hypertension induced by oral contraceptives, primary aldosteronism and renal artery stenosis have to be excluded; these hypertensive disorders show similar biochemical changes, but should be treated by surgical intervention. The choice of other contraceptives by women with this type of hypertensive disease is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

They can only be assessed indirectly on a model basis using drugs savings as the benefit's indicator. If for example those some 880,000 diabetics of the Federal Republic of Germany who are treated with oral antidiabetic drugs and suffer from overweight would lose weight as a consequence of dietetic consultation, they could save at least 1 pill per day of a blood glucose lowering sulfonamide or biguanide derivate. This equals about 131 million DM p.a. If only 10 percent of 1000 diabetics under the advice of one assistant dietician would lose weight--in about 20 percent of all dietetic consultations such a success can be expected--this would cover the cost of such consultation.--In fact, in a sample of 228 diabetics with overweight, who received intensive advice on weight reduction, 85 percent were successful in losing weight, improved their metabolism, and therefore needed less antidiabetic drugs. They thus achieved annual cost savings about equal to an assistent dietician's salary. Thus, the employment of assistant dieticians in the medical practice is an advantage also from the economic point of view, and should be made possible for all practitioners interested.</AbstractText>"}

The records of those who remained well and those who suffered a relapse were compared in an attempt to identify factors that might affect liability to thromboembolic relapse. During the follow-up period there were 37 thromboembolic recurrences, an incidence of 22 per cent. None occurred among the patients in whom the original diagnosis of thromboembolic disease was discarded or when a predisposing cause had ceased to be present. There was an inverse relation between liability to relapse and degree of prothrombin time prolongation.NO SIGNIFICANT RELATION COULD BE SHOWN BETWEEN LIABILITY TO RELAPSE AND ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: sex and age; type and severity of the initiating thromboembolic episode; history of earlier thromboembolic disease or relapse after stopping earlier anticoagulant courses; presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or diabetes mellitus; type of anticoagulant drug used, duration of therapy, and method of stopping treatment. Patients with overt occlusive arterial disease at more than one site had a significantly increased liability to relapse when compared with patients with symptomatic disease at a single site. In the group of 134 subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy for coronary arterial disease, occurrence of a thromboembolic episode during the course of treatment and the presence of angina of effort in the months before it was discontinued were both associated with a significant increase in liability to relapse. It is suggested that, ideally, anticoagulant therapy should be continued indefinitely in any patient whose pattern of disease thus increases the likelihood of a thromboembolic recurrence.</AbstractText>"}

However, there were relatively more women, the patients were older, and the incidence of appendicitis as an etiologic factor was much lower in this series than in the preantibiotic era. Ascending cholangitis was the most common etiologic factor throught this series, although malignant extrahepatic obstruction has become more prevalent in recent years. Escherichia coli remains the most commonly isolated organism, and gram-negative organisms are found in 72 per cent of the cultures. More than one organism was isolated in 65 per cent of the patients and there has been a significant increase in the number of anaerobic organisms isolated in recent years. Furthermore, a majority of anaerobic abscesses were solitary, and therefore, they had a better prognosis. The factors associated with a poor prognosis were age greater than 70 years, multiple abscesses, a biliary cause, an associated malignant condition, jaundice, an elevated serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase level, hypoalbuminemia, polymorphonucleocytosis, bactermia especially with multiple organisms, aerobic infection, and pulmonary, peritoneal, or other significant complication.</AbstractText>"}

Low concentrations of the peptides inhibit the response to submaximal doses of epinephrine, while higher concentrations of the peptides enhance the effect of supramaximal doses of epinephrine. Half-maximal doses are: (a) inhibition of lipolysis: insulin, 2.3 times 10- minus 11M; proinsulin, 6.9 times 10- minus 10M; (b) enhancement of lipolysis: insulin, 3.1 times 10- minus 9M; proinsulin, 8.1 times 10- minus 8M. The ratios of the potencies of the peptides are the same for both effects. These results suggest that both the inhibitory and the lipolytic effects of insulin are not caused by contaminants, and are mediated by similar receptors.</AbstractText>"}

Infusion of porcine insulin at rates of 6, 9, 16 and 33 mU/hr. resulted in stable perfusate insulin levels averaging 41, 72, 120 and 229 muU/ml., respectively. Since the portal vein insulin concentration in the intact rat averaged 48 muU/ml. after a twenty-six-hour fast and 125 muU/ml. two hours after removal of food, the studies were conducted at insulin levels within the physiological range. The effect of each insulin concentration on the net accumulation of K+, AMINO ACID NITROGEN, UREA NITROGEN AND GLUCOSE IN The perfusing medium was assessed against the net accumulation of perfusate constituents during perfusion of control livers and livers perfused with perfusate insulin levels greater than 500 muU/ml. The results indicate that essentially maximal suppression of amino acid nitrogen outflow and retention of K+ OCCURRED AT INSULIN CONCENTRAtions of 72 muU/ml., with lesser effects being noted at 41 muU/ml. Inhibition of ureogenesis was demonstrated at insulin levels above 120 muU/ml. However, significant effects of insulin on suppressing net glucose outflow was not observed until insulin levels had reached 500 muU/ml. due presumably to the absence of a sustained rate of glycogenolysis by control livers. The observation that perfused livers from normal rats are extremely sensitive to several metabolic effects of insulin at physiological concentrations suggests that this experimental approach can provide useful information as to the role of the liver in the pathogenesis of various insulin resistant states.</AbstractText>"}

A patient with occasional attacks of hypoglycemia had levels of serum immunoreactive insulin persistently fifty to one-hundred times the normal value. Immunoelectrophoresis revealed presence of monoclonal IgG in his serum. The patient's diagnosis was established as paraproteinemic lymphoid and plasmocytic reticulosis proximate to multiple myeloma; insuloma was not found. 2. On gel filtration of native serum, only part of the total immunoreactivity was found in the elution position of crystalline insulin; the major part emerged in the early fractions together with the large proteins. After acidification of the serum, however, practically the entire immunoreactivity was recovered in ethanol extracts and proved to be 'little insulin' on gel filtration. Only, 'little insulin' was also detected after gel filtration of serum incubated with urea. 3. It is suggested that the large component with insulin immunoreactivity obtained in gel filtration of native serum is an insulin-protein complex. The nature of the presumed complex is not clear. It is not a complex of the antigen-antibody type. Insulin 'trapping' by monoclonal gamma globulin is considered.</AbstractText>"}

Glucose tolerance in these patients was improved or remained unchanged during the clinical course. Aggravation in glucose tolerance was observed in only seven cases. However, abnormalities in glucose tolerance were still found in 107 cases (88%) of the subclinical diabetes. Insulin response to oral glucose was investigated in 74 patients with subclinical diabetes. Delayed response and/or decreased response in the initial phase were demonstrated in 58 out of 74 patients (79%). No significant difference was observed in the insulinogenic index (ratio of insulin increment/glucose increment) at 30 min between the normal controls and either group with abnormal glucose tolerance. Diabetic retinopathy, including microaneurysm, was detected in 25 out of 109 patients with diabetic glucose tolerance. Abnormal insulin response, delayed and/or decreased, was demonstrated in 13 of 16 patients with diabetic retinopathy (81%). These results indicate the possibility that subclinical diabetes in the present study is a mild type of primary diabetes. In addition, it is suggested that abnormal response of plasma insulin to glucose, delayed and/or decreased, might be one of the prominent findings in diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

Five had organic disease sufficient to account for the amenorrhoea (one had severe diabetes, one a pituitary tumour, and three premature ovarian failure); two patients had galactorrhoea (one of whom also had the pituitary tumour); two had anorexia nervosa.Of the 63 women 40 (63%) had suffered from amenorrhoea or prolonged or irregular menstrual cycles before taking the pill, and this suggested that combined oestrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives should be used with caution for women with irregular menstruation.Nineteen patients wished to become pregnant and 12 have so far done so after treatment with clomiphene or gonadotrophins.In another study 204 women recorded when their first menstrual cycle occurred after stopping the pill. Seventy-four had a cycle longer than five weeks but only five exceeded three months, and only one of the five had more than six months' amenorrhoea. These results confirm that the incidence of amenorrhoea after stopping oral contraceptives is low.</AbstractText>"}

Four of the perinatal deaths were due to the respiratory distress syndrome. The patients whose diabetes was diagnosed during pregnancy had significantly heavier babies (18 pregnancies, mean birth weight 3337 g) than the established diabetics (83 pregnancies, mean weight 3011 g) despite significantly lower fasting blood glucose levels in the former and similar mean gestational ages at delivery. Mean fasting blood glucose levels for the whole series during the first, second and third trimesters were 9.0, 6.7 and 5.6 mmol/l respectively. The mean duration of antenatal stay in hospital for complications related to diabetes was 29 days. Diabetic retinopathy did not seem to be adversely affected by pregnancy.</AbstractText>"}

Forty-seven per cent of the grafts were still patent among surviving patients, and when combined with the limbs that were viable despite failure of the original graft, 70% of the limbs were salvaged among the survivors at five years. Temporary graft patency was effective in preserving ischemic tissue by facilitating healing of ulcers or limited amputations. Femoral-popliteal bypass grafting in the presence of advanced ischemia is capable of improving the quality of life for many of these patients.</AbstractText>"}

Bile lipid composition was expressed as 'saturation index.' In the maturity-onset diabetics the saturation index (1.60 +/- 0.45 SDM) was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than that in the controls (0.82 +/- 0.20) and in patients with juvenile diabetes (0.75 +/- 0.24). The absolute values for biliary bile acid concentration were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in the maturity-onset diabetics than in the other two groups. There were no differences in either the proportion of the individual biliary bile acids or the size of the bile acid pool between the three groups. The results suggest that the incidence of cholelithiasis in diabetes is associated with the secretion of a supersaturated bile only in the maturity-onset subgroup.</AbstractText>"}

The condition was found (considering the total number of gastroscopies) in men 1.38 times as often as in women; the average age of all patients at the time of diagnosis was 62.5 years. Xanthelasma lesions are yellow or yellowish-white spots in the mucosa, consisting of foam-cells microscopically. The cytoplasma stains pale pink in a HE preparation; there is almost no staining with PAS, and sudan black staining is definitely positive in most cases. PAS and sudan black staining do allow differentiation of signet ring carcinoma cells. Gastric xanthelasma occurs quite often concurrently with chronic gastritis. It is due to local, not to general disturbances of lipid metabolism. Lipids probably are formed within the mucosa cells or may--in cases of intestinal metaplasia--originate from the gastric contents. Gastric xanthelasma does not constitute a nosologic entity, it is merely a consequence of other diseases of the gastric mucosa.</AbstractText>"}

In addition to blood flows to major organs and tissues, the model includes representations for insulin feedback regulation of hepatic insulin clearance and pancreatic insulin secretion. Within the range of insulin sensitivities assumed for hepatic and pancreatic feedback regulation and the range of initial insulin secretion rates employed, the model predicts that the fasting arterial insulin concentration rises by up to 20 muU. per milliliter as portal blood flow increases. The necessary elevations in portal blood flow lie well inside the range of increased total hepatic blood flow observed in obese subjects. The results of this study suggest that a significant portion of the elevation in fasting insulin concentrations seen in obesity may be the result of increased portal blood flow and that other clinical observations and metabolic changes that accompany obesity may also be related to altered portal flow.</AbstractText>"}

When rat diaphragms were incubated with the peptide in the presence of insulin, the peptide depressed insulin-mediated (a) glucose uptake, (b) glycogen synthesis, and (c) glycogen synthase activation (conversion of D to I form). Incubation with the peptide alone resulted in small increases in (a), (b), and (c). Insulin-mediated glycogen synthase kinase inactivation was inhibited when both insulin and peptide were present (d), whereas glycogen synthase kinase activity was lowered by the peptide alone. High doses of insulin completely reversed inhibitory effects of the peptide on glycogen synthesis. Therefore, the hyperglycemic and anti-insulin properties of this peptide in vivo can possibly be explained by the partial blocking action of the peptide on insulin-mediated glucose uptake and glycogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Variations in expired air 13C, after glucose load, are indicative of the catabolism of this exogenous glucose. The changes in the 13C/12C ratio of CO2 in expired air after oral administration of glucose were determined by mass spectrometry. Results in eleven healthy volunteers and seven obese subjects with normal oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) are reported. In all cases, the administration of glucose resulted in a marked rise in the 13C/12C ration of expired CO2, reaching its maximum at the fourth hour and then declining progressively. In seven obese patients with chemical diabetes and in five insulin-dependent diabetics, the 13C/12C ratio of expired CO2 during OGTT was significantly reduced, in comparison with the results obtained from the control groups. This study demonstrates the potential of this procedure using 'naturally labeled' 13C glucose for the metabolic studies in man as anticipated from previous studies of Duchesne and his coworkers.</AbstractText>"}

In two cases the liver was palpable and results of liver function tests were abnormal. The older child, who was blind and mentally retarded, had growth failure. The extent of the pituitary hormone deficiencies was variable, including diabetes insipidus. The septum pellucidum was not invariably absent. Clinical and pathological findings indicate that the brain lesion might be more diffuse than hitherto recognized. Early recognition of this syndrome and timely intervention might diminish serious sequels.</AbstractText>"}

The previously reported curvilinear HSAP rise starting at about 28 gestational weeks was noted. No relation was seen between HSAP levels and milk or moderate hypertension, gestational diabetes, nontoxemic placental insufficiency, or maternal blood group. HSAP levels were mostly above normal in proteinuric hypertension and were low normal in pregnant insulin-dependent diabetics. Two neonatal deaths were associated with normal HSAP levels. Of 4 intrauterine deaths, 1 was associated with high, 1 with low, and 2 with rising values in the normal range. Serial maternal HSAP values are apparently not a specific indicator of placental function or fetal status.</AbstractText>"}

A method of correcting for this problem was developed and used to measure glucagon levels in 60 diabetic and 30 nondiabetic subjects. No significant difference was found between the two groups. Twelve percent of the diabetic subjects had evidence of glucagon binding in their plasma which prevented valid measurement of their glucagon levels. Characterization of the 'interference factor' was undertaken with G-200 sephadex column chromatography. Large amounts of glucagon-like immunoreactivity were found in fractions indicating an approximate molecular weight of 160,000. It was demonstrated that this 'factor' was not an artifact of charcoal treatment of plasma. The original source of this material is unknown.</AbstractText>"}

Evidence for a saturable system in man.","Journal":"Diabetes","Date":"Aug 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Concentrations of glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) are elevated in diabetes mellitus and are believed to reflect previous metabolic control. To better define possible determinants of GHb in man, we investigated the relationship between GHb and both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and basal insulin (IRI) in 42 normal subjects and 29 patients with maturity-onset diabetes. Concentrations of GHb in diabetic subjects (12.7 +/- 3.4, x +/- S.D., per cent total hemoglobin) were significantly higher than in normal subjects (8.2 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.001). In normal subjects, FPG (r = 0.52) and GHb (r = 0.58) (both p less than 0.001) correlated with age. GHb did not correlate with IRI in either group. However, GHb was closely associated with FPG in both normal (r = 0.60, p less than 0.001) and diabetic (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001) subjects. Linear regression analysis of the data for the two groups combined was highly significant (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001). However, the slope of the regression line for GHb versus FPG seen in normal subjects was significantly steeper than that of diabetic patients (p less than 0.005). A curve describing a nonenzymatic saturable model was also found to fit the data of the two groups combined (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001), suggesting the possible existence of a saturable system for glycosylation in man.</AbstractText>"}

Venous plasma glucose concentrations at fasting and after a 75-gm. oral glucose load were determined in 596 Nauruans, a Micronesian population with a diabetes prevalence of the same order as the Pima Indians. In both sexes and in subjects 10 to 19 years, the frequency distributions of the logarithms of the fasting and two-hour glucose values were clearly unimodal. In most sex and age groups of 20 years and older, the frequency distributions of fasting and two-hour glucose values were bimodal and consistent with a model of two overlapping Gaussian distributions. This population is characterized by marked obesity. However, there was no significant difference in the degree of obesity between subjects in the first and second curves of the bimodal distribution. This makes it unlikely that the bimodality is a consequence of the marked obesity seen in both the Pima and Nauru populations. The data show that among Nauruans, as with the Pimas, the frequency distribution of glucose concentrations can be used to separate the population into normal and hyperglycemic groups.</AbstractText>"}

The shortest duration of diabetes mellitus prior to diagnosis of PDR was eight years. Ten patients had a positive family history of diabetes. Thirteen patients had suboptimal metabolic control. Ten patients had some degree of azotemia, seven were hypertensive, and six had proteinuria. Ophthalmic findings included advanced neovascular and fibrous proliferation on initial classification, and rapid progression to blindness-which was most frequently secondary to traction retinal detachment. In a small retrospective study, pituitary ablation may have offered greater preservation of vision than that observed in untreated patients.</AbstractText>"}

Insulin mediation of the hypoglycemia was confirmed by documenting that urinary insulin and total extractable insulin in plasma increased during periods of hypoglycemia. Failure to detect significant amounts of human C-peptide by radioimmunoassay during periods of hypoglycemia or in response to stimulation with glucagon, leucine, or tolbutamide indicated that the insulin was not endogenous. The diagnosis of factitious hyperinsulinism was ultimately proved by the finding of radioactivity in the patient's urine after 131-I Hippuran was added to a vial of insulin found in the patient's room.</AbstractText>"}

To examine left ventricular performance in diabetic patients without clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia or other cardiovascular disease, a noninvasive measurement of the systolic time intervals was carried out. Simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram, heart sounds, and carotid pulse were made in 25 diabetic subjects, 20 to 56 years of age, and compared with 37 normal subjects. The diabetic subjects had a shorter left ventricular ejection time, longer pre-ejection period, and a higher ratio of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time (P less than 0.001). The isovolumic time was prolonged (P less than 0.001), while heart rate and arterial pressure were within normal limits. Abnormal function was independent of apparent duration and treatment by diet alone, insulin, or hypoglycemic agents. On the basis of available morphologic data in human and canine diabetes, an alteration of the myocardial interstitium may be the basis for this preclinical abnormality in diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

Taking the existence of clinical diabetes as a starting point, the total illness experience of 635 diabetics, as shown by clinic utilization data, has been compared with an age-sex-geographically matched control population. The comparisons show that, overall, diabetics cause a caseload rate more than double that of nondiabetics. In 17 out of 22 broad health problem areas, the diagnosis caseload rates for diabetics varied from 1.3 to 3.7 times greater than the rate for matched, non-diabetic controls. Workload (physician visit and hospital days) comparisons showed even greater disparity. Some of the comparisons confirm statistically the clinical impressions of diabetologists over the past years. Some of the findings are not reflections of orthodox clinical opinion. The results contribute to further elucidation of the natural history of this disease. They also indicate the need for the development of comprehensive clinical management programs for groups of interrelated conditions found in persons with chronic disease such as diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

In some, prenatal urinary obstruction leads to such severe oligohydramnios that the fetus is stillborn. Others, somewhat less affected, are born alive but have severe respiratory distress from hypoplastic (stiff) lungs and die of respiratory problems. Still others can be associated with massive ascites and urinomas, and be stillborn or die soon after birth. In less severe cases the neonates may have unexplained respiratory distress with pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax as the only indication of obstructive urologic disease with deficient urinary output. Urinomas or ascites may later develop beyond the neonatal period as the post-natal obstructive effects of the valves accumulate and the urinary system ruptures and decompresses itself. Finally when the urinary system does not decompress itself, the back pressure can lead to rapid and progressive renal damage until the kidneys can no longer concentrate urine and lose water. The infant becomes dry, acidotic and paradoxically at this stage, puts out large quantities of dilute urine. Physicians caring for infants should be highly suspicious of posterior urethral valves in any male infant with unexplained respiratory distress or metabolic derangements, abdominal distension or flank masses.</AbstractText>"}

Renal function was evaluated before and after infusion IVP in 40 patients with chronic renal insufficiency. In 11 of 12 (92%) diabetics and 17 of 28 (61%) nondiabetics, a 25% or greater increase in serum creatinine values and/or decrease in creatinine clearance was noted after IVP despite adequate hydration in all patients. The maximum decrease in kidney function occurred within three days and usually returned to or near pre-IVP levels in seven to ten days. At least 70% of the patients had hypertension and/or evidence of vascular disease. The data suggest that preexisting vascular disease in the kidney, possibly associated with the known vasoconstricting effects of contrast media, may be an important factor in the ARF following infusion IVP.</AbstractText>"}

Some of the basic concepts of triglyceride metabolism are reviewed in a context of clinical applicability. Hypertriglyceridemia may be associated with dramatic symptoms and signs such as acute abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and neuromuscular abnormalities, or it may be asymptomatic until an atherosclerotic complication occurs. There is an increased risk of atherosclerosis with elevated endogenous triglycerides, but it is not clear if this is due to triglycerides per se, or the cholesterol content of the common lipoprotein that transports both lipids. Serum triglycerides are affected by diverse underlying disorders. Several factors play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia including diet, body weight, genetic influences, glucose metabolism, and insulin concentrations. Treatment by diet and/or drugs is quite effective in relieving many of the clinical manifestations of hypertriglyceridemia. Whether a beneficial effect also occurs in atherosclerosis is still unknown.</AbstractText>"}

The total lod score was the highest (3.98) at a recombination fraction of 13%. For a penetrance of 100%, the highest total lod score was 2.92 at a recombination fraction of 18%. These results are compatible with the existence of linkage between an autosomal recessive diabetic gene with 50% penetrance and the HLA in some of the families studied. Our ascertainment strategy would be expected to increase the likelihood of selecting for genetically homogenous diabetes and against sporadic forms of the disease. Thus, our findings may apply only to a small proportion of all cases of juvenile, insulin-dependent diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

A similar defect in the conversion of T(4) to T(3) in the livers of fasted animals was observed when preparations were incubated with substrate concentrations of T(4) so that T(3) generation could be assessed by radioimmunoassay. The effect of fasting could be prevented, wholly or in part, by administration of glucose in the drinking water to otherwise fasted animals, and the degree of prevention appeared to be proportional to the concentration of glucose employed. Diminished generation of T(3) from T(4) was similarly evident in the livers of animals with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, and this defect was overcome by the provision of insulin in vivo, but not in vitro. Decreased formation of T(3) from T(4) was also observed in preparations of liver from animals given dexamethasone, amiodarone, and propylthiouracil. In no case could these effects on the net formation of T(3) from T(4) be explained by effects of the experimental conditions on the degradation of the T(3) generated, as judged from the rate of degradation of exogenous (125)I-T(3) measured in parallel incubates. An analysis of the rate of disappearance of (125)I-T(4) from reaction mixtures in relation to the rate of appearance of (125)I-T(3) and (125)I-iodide was employed to estimate the activity of the 5-monodeiodinating pathway of T(4) metabolism that leads to the formation of 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T(3)). Such estimates indicated that reverse T(3) formation was actively proceeding in the preparations studied, was slightly enhanced by fasting, was unaffected by dexamethasone and amiodarone, and was markedly inhibited by propylthiouracil. In view of the similarities between the effect of these experimental manipulations on the generation of T(3) from T(4) by rat liver in vitro to their effects on the production rates and serum concentrations of T(3) in man, it is concluded that the rat liver system provides a suitable model for the study of factors that influence the conversion of T(4) to T(3) in man. In addition, the findings strongly indicate that this process, at least in the liver, is closely linked to the utilization of carbohydrate.</AbstractText>"}

Ultrastructural examination of the islets indicated that the volume-density of vincristine-induced deposits was markedly reduced in B-cells of spiny mice, when compared to that found in normal rats and mice and DBM mice. Exposure of the islets from spiny mice to a high glucose concentration, concomittantly to vincristine, caused a further reduction in vincristine-induced crystals content of the B-cell. It is speculated that an impairment of the B-cell microtubular system may account for the deficiency of insulin release found in spiny mice.</AbstractText>"}

Arginine stimulates glucagon release in the presence of 2.5 mM glucose in Wistar rats as well as in sand rats. The secretion pattern is not caused by insulin deficiency since sand rat islets are characterized by an increased insulin secretion rate in vitro. This paradoxical glucagon secretion is not caused by a changed glucagon content but might be related to this species which is able to develop a diabetic syndrome spontaneously.</AbstractText>"}

All had an abnormal secretin-pancreozymin test. Four patients had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, four a pathological glucose tolerance test. Nine patients had steatorrhoea. Maltase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly elevated in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, whereas those of lactase, trehalase, and peptide hydrolase were normal. Patients with steatorrhoea had higher maltase and sucrase activity than those without steatorrhoea, whereas decreased glucose tolerance had no effect on brush border enzymatic activity. It is suggested thatdecreased exocrine rather than decreased endocrine pancreatic function is responsible for the increase in intestinal disaccharidase and alkaline phosphatase activity, possible by the influence of pacreatic enzymes on the turnover of brush border enzymes from the luminal side of the mucosal membranes or by direct hormonal stimulation though cholecystokinin.</AbstractText>"}

All patients proved refractory to various combinations of androgens and corticosteroids. The first case, harboring a thymoma, showed a complete clinical remission following cyclophosphamide therapy. The second and third responded similarly to either a combined cyclophosphamide + antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) treatment or to ALG administration preceded by a small dosage of cyclophosphamide, which had proved ineffective when administered alone. Serum IgG inhibitors to erythropoiesis were demonstrated in all cases by  means of in vivo and/or in vitro techniques. The inhibitor(s), although directed against the erythroid marrow in both the first and third patients (PRCA type A), apparently functioned as an antibody to circulating erythropoientin (Ep) in the second case (PRCA type B). The inhibitor(s) was always absent in postremission samples. Additionally, experimental models for both types of human PRCA were established in normal rodents. The present studies support the contention that adult PRCA is an autoimmune disease. The therapeutic role of cytotoxic-immunodepressive agents in PRCA patients is confirmed. It is emphasized that ALG may represent an additional therapeutic tool in cases resistant to cyclophosphamide and/or steroids. In addition, cyclophosphamide proved effective in a patient harboring a thymoma not amenable to surgery. Finally, it is postulated that IgG serum autoantibodies, directed against either an early erythroid precursor (PRCA type A) or, more rarely, circulating Ep (PRCA type B), play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Study of a group of 50 patients suspected to have coronary artery disease. This is a complement to a previous study concerning 'definite' coronary patients. 2. The method followed consisted in cross-examination of the files by three observers in order to separate the subjects who seemed really affected by coronary artery disease. This treble examination led to a rather restrictive selection. To facilitate the study, the patients were subdivided into 4 groups: patients with arterial hypertension, with diabetes mellitus, with cardiac failure, with a heart disease and miscellaneous patients. 3. The study of the 20 files which were discarded was peculiarly interesting as it provided the opportunity to underline the differential diagnosis either with common diseases (left ventricular overload, heart block, brain vascular accident), or with more specific diseases for Black Africa (endomyocardial fibrosis, aneurysm of the left ventricle, cardiomyopathy). In that respect, it is underlined that, in the absence of any anatomical or functional disease, the electrocardiogram of the healthy Black is identical to that of the White. 4. Study of the 30 patients considered as coronary made it possible to underline aetiological and epidemiological factors, although some are still lacking. However the facts observed could be compared with those reported in a previous work concerning 45 'definite' coronary patients. The overall documents thus gathered in 75 patients suggest that the African candidate to coronary artery diseases resembles his Occidental homologue, but that he might have kept a traditional diet.</AbstractText>"}

The high incidence of atherosclerosis in these patients on a marginal diet remains an enigma, and we suggest that carbohydrate-induced hyperlipidaemia might be an important aetiological factor. There were 13 men with middle cerebral occlusions, the aetiology of which remains obscure. Occult embolism or atherothrombosis are suggested as possible causative factors. Of the 12 women five had middle cerebral artery occlusions in the last trimester of pregnancy and two had internal carotid artery occlusions in the puerperium. The pattern of ischaemic strokes in women aged 15-45 was similar to that observed in Western countries, though our patients differed ethnologically and in dietary habits.</AbstractText>"}

It is no longer just a failure of the pancreas to release insulin. It may be a resistance to insulin, so that amounts which would ordinarily be normal are no longer adequate for the body. The relative deficiency of insulin may also represent the release of what would otherwise be normal amounts of insulin at the wrong time. Indeed diabetes may not only be insulin deficiency, but also glucagon excess. The consequences of this complex hormonal imbalance are not simply failure to metabolize glucose, but also excessive production of glucose and alteration of the body's capacity to handle the other nutrients - amino acids and fatty acids. Not only may these two hormones, insulin and glucagon, regulate the metabolism of more than glucose alone but they are, in turn, regulated by more than glucose. Furthermore, one consequence of inability to burn glucose along normal pathways may be that it is converted to substances such as sorbitol and glycoproteins and this conversion may give rise to many of the complications of diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

While clinical grade hGH (200 microgram/ml) elicited a prompt and sustained release of insulin, purified intact hGH (200 microgram/ml) did not. Naturally occurring diabetogenic substance, isolated from clinical grade hGH preparations, stimulated insulin release at 200 ng/ml. Upon repeat stimulation with NDS, a significantly greater insulin release than with initial stimulation was observed. Although S3 (200 microgram/ml) elicited significant insulin release, S1 (200 microgram/ml) did not. Direct stimulation of insulin release with clinical grade hGH is not due to intact hGH but another proteins(s) such as NDS.

In the posttransplant period, his serum potassium concentration (3.7 to 6.7 mEq/liter) fluctuated widely with the serum glucose concentration (165 to 470 mg/dl) during the day. Serum glucose and potassium concentrations were directly correlated (r = .734, P less than .001). Other factors controlling the serum potassium concentration were examined. Plasma and urinary aldosterone levels were normal, plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels rose during upright activity, and urinary potassium excretion increased with the administration of exogenous mineralocorticoid. Thus, mineralocorticoid secretion and responsiveness were intact. These observations indicate that hyperkalemia in a diabetic patient can occur in the absence of a defect in potassium excretion and are consistent with the interpretation that insulinopenia, as evidenced by hyperglycemia, can result in hyperkalemia due to diminshed translocation of both potassium and glucose from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment.</AbstractText>"}

'Normal values' for serum cholesterol, if defined statistically, vary between communities, and levels of cholesterol in childhood above which an increased risk of coronary heart disease in adult life may be expected have not been firmly established. It is suggested that serum cholesterol concentration over 250 mg/dl (6.47 mmol/l) in a child over 1 year of age merits detailed investigation, including full lipoprotein analysis, and levels of serum cholesterol between230 and 250 mg/dl (5.95-6.47 mmol/l) should be repeated with further studies if indicated. Secondary hyperlipoproteinaemia rarely presents diagnostic problems but must always be excluded. The only primary hyperlipoproteinaemia likely to be encountered in childhood is familial hyperbetalipoproteinaemia in its common heterozygous form. The most effective means to date of lowering serum cholesterol in this condition is cholestyramine, but the long-term consequences of therapy are not known and treatment should at present be limited to children from high-risk families. Long-term follow-up is essential and until results of such studies are available population screening is unjustified.</AbstractText>"}

The infusion of sodium dichloroacetate into rats with severe diabetic ketoacidosis over 4h caused a 2mM decrease in blood glucose, and small falls in blood lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Similar findings had been reported in normal rats (Blackshear et al., 1974). In contrast there was a marked decrease in blood ketone-body concentration in the diabetic ketoacidotic rats after dichloroacetate treatment. 2. The infusion of insulin alone rapidly decreased blood glucose and ketone bodies, but caused an increase in blood lactate and pyruvate. 3. Dichloroacetate did not affect the response to insulin of blood glucose and ketone bodies, but abolished the increase of lactate and pyruvate seen after insulin infusion. 4. Neither insulin nor dichloroacetate stimulated glucose disappearance after functional hepatectomy, but both agents decreased the accumulation in blood of lactate, pyruvate and alanine. 5. Dichloroacetate inhibited 3-hydroxybutyrate uptake by the extra-splachnic tissues; insulin reversed this effect. Ketone-body production must have decreased, as hepatic ketone-body content was unchanged by dicholoracetate yet blood concentrations decreased. 6. It was concluded that: (a) dichloroacetate had qualitatively similar effects on glucose metabolism in severely ketotic rats to those observed in non-diabetic starved animals; (b) insulin and dichloroacetate both separately and together, decreased the net release of lactate, pyruvate and alanine from the extra-splachnic tissues, possibly through a similar mechanism; (c) insulin reversed the inhibition of 3-hydroxybutyrate uptake caused by dichloroacetate; (d) dichloroacetate inhibited ketone-body production in severe ketoacidosis.</AbstractText>"}

Neither of the sorbitol pathway intermediates, sorbitol or fructose, were detected either in intact glomeruli which had been isolated from rats rendered chronically diabetic with streptozotocin, or in metabolically active glomeruli which had been incubated in vitro in high glucose media. Such data agreed with previously published observations that the enzyme aldose reductase is not present in renal glomeruli, and suggested that changes in sorbitol pathway activity cannot be directly related to the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Sorbitol was detected in low concentrations (3.1 mu-mol/g protein) in cortical tubules which had been isolated from the renal cortex of rats rendered chronically diabetic with streptozotocin. This concentration of sorbitol was higher than that in the intact renal cortex of the diabetic animal (0.3 mu-mol/g protein) or in the cortical tubules of non-diabetic animals (0.5 mu-mol/g protein). It is apparent that the renal cortical tubule is a major site of sorbitol pathway activity in the renal cortex. However, there is presently no obvious causal relationship between the accumulation of such relatively low concentrations of sorbitol in the renal cortical tubule and the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis or cortical tubular lesions in diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

These observations together with other studies suggested that insulin-dependent glucose transport and metabolism by the alpha-cells serves as the primary mechanism controlling glucagon secretion. This hypothesis was tested in the present investigation. The possible interactions between glucose, insulin, and a mixture of 20 amino acids at physiological proportions were examined in the isolated-perfusin diabetic rats. Release of insulin and glucagon were used as indicators of theta-cell and alpha-cell function. According to rigid criteria the diabetic animals entering the study were severely diabetic. It was found that in vitro: (a) basal glucagon release (measured in the absence of an alpha-cell stimulus or inhibitor) was extremely low, even lower (i.e. 10%) than the basal rates seen in controls; (b) the alpha-cells of alloxanized- and streptozotocin-treated rats responded with a biphasic glucagon release to stimulation by an amino acid mixture; (c) this alpha-cell response was reduced after both streptozotocin and alloxan; (d) glucose at 5 mM was a potent inhibitor of amino acid-induced glucagon secretion in both types of experimental diabetes; (e) in alloxan diabetes alpha-cell stimulation by amino acids can be curbed by exogenous insulin, whereas glucagon secretion by the perfused pancreas of streptoxotocin diabetic rats appeared to be resistant to insulin action. The data indicate that the modulation of glucagon secretion by glucose in vitro is indipendent of insulin and that other unknown factors extrinsic to the pancreatic islets are responsible for the hyperglucagonemia observed in vivo.</AbstractText>"}

All diabetic sera tested contained an islet-binding protein and on the average the sera were more positive than age-matched controls. Normal adult sera are undifferentiated from juvenile diabetic sera. Most sera from children less than two years of age did not bind to islet tissue and sera from cystic fibrosis patients had a markedly diminished ability to bind to islet tissue. The binding protein appears to be an immunoglobulin which selectively reacts with elements of the islet beta cell.</AbstractText>"}

Glucagon content of the tumor was 0.78 mug/g wet weight. Hourly blood samples during a 24 hour period revealed a direct correlation between plasma glucose and glucagon. The oral administration of glucose paradoxically increased whereas the intravenous administration decreased plasma glucagon. Circulating glucagon levels were markedly increased with arginine and epinephrine infusion. Both short- and long-term administration of alpha adrenergic blockade depressed the glucagon response to epinephrine infusion. In contrast, long-term alpha adrenergic blockade increased glucagon secretion despite improved glucose tolerance during a second 24 hour study. Although the patient demonstrated overt clinical and chemical findings of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was not detected in her plasma. The pattern of tumor growth was consistent with an origin from pancreatic islets. We conclude that (1) the tumor was responsive to physiologic stimuli known to affect glucagon secretion; (2) elevations of plasma glucagon levels with oral and dietary glucose suggest regulation of secretion by intestinal factors; and (3) improvement of glucose tolerance with alpha adrenergic blockade may be related to increased insulin secretion.</AbstractText>"}

Ultrastructural alterations become evident in capillaries and beta cells at a time when large amounts of virus are present in the pancreatic tissue. Although some beta cells become necrotic, degranulation and contraction of intact cells is the prominent lesion. Changes in the capillaries appear early in the course of the infection and later are associated with interstitial fibrosis in and around the islets. During early convalescence, beta cells are degranulated and exhibit striking alterations of cytoplasmic organelles. These changes appear to be consequent to increased metabolic activity by the residual insular tissue. Interestingly enough, specific lesions of the alpha cells are not observed.</AbstractText>"}

DBA/2 animals develop striking inflammatory and necrotizing lesions of the islets of Langerhans; in contrast, alterations of the insular tissue in the C3H mice are minimal.

The three groups did not differ in prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, old infarction or duration of disease. There were no significant differences in number of diseased vessels, coronary score, abnormal left ventricular wall motion or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Angiograms performed 2 weeks postoperatively revealed closure of 3 of 31 grafts (16 patients) in Group A, closure of 3 of 34 grafts (17 patients) in Group B and closure of 6 of 50 grafts (22 patients) in Group C (differences not significant). Postoperative angiograms showed improved wall motion in 37 percent of Group A, 53 percent of Group B and 36 percent of Group C (differences not significant). Postoperative new Q waves appeared in one hospital in Group A and in two patients in Groups B and C. There were no hospital or late deaths. In a mean follow-up period of 29 months, 68 percent of patients in Group A, 61 percent in Group B and 54 percent in Group C were asymptomatic. Thus, bypass grafting was performed with similarly low mortality and morbidity in patients with subendocardial infarction and in those with angina; more than one third of postoperative angiograms in the three groups showed improved wall motion; and late follow-up studies demonstrated functional improvement in the majority of patients in all three groups.</AbstractText>"}

TSAb was detected in 14 of 15 (93%) patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and in 10 of 16 (63%) patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Of the patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, TSAb was detected in 9 of 10 patients who had once been hyperthyroid and in only 1 of 6 patients who had never been hyperthyroid (euthyroid Graves' disease). TSAb was detected in 1 patient with idiopathic Addison's disease (autoimmune adrenalitis) and in 1 patient with juvenile diabetes mellitus (both of whom were euthyroid), and borderline levels were found in 1 patient with Sjögren's syndrome and 1 patient with methyldopa-induced antired blood cell antibodies. TSAb was not detected in normal subjects or patients with other thyroid disorders. The conclusions are: 1) the test is very useful in the diagnosis of Graves' disease; 2) Graves' eye disease may be a frequently associated but separate disorder; and 3) because TSAb may be present in some euthyroid patients with other autoimmune disorders, TSAb production may occur primarily because of a disorder in the immune system.</AbstractText>"}

The conversion of inactive (phosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex into active (dephosphorylated) complex by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase is inhibited in heart mitochondria prepared from alloxan-diabetic or 48h-starved rats, in mitochondria prepared from acetate-perfused rat hearts and in mitochondria prepared from normal rat hearts incubated with respiratory substrates for 6 min (as compared with 1 min). 2. This conclusion is based on experiments with isolated intact mitochondria in which the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction was inhibited by pyruvate or ATP depletion (by using oligomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), and in experiments in which the rate of conversion of inactive complex into active complex by the phosphatase was measured in extracts of mitochondria. The inhibition of the phosphatase reaction was seen with constant concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (activators of the phosphatase). The phosphatase reaction in these mitochondrial extracts was not inhibited when an excess of exogenous pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate was used as substrate. It is concluded that this inhibition is due to some factor(s) associated with the substrate (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate complex) and not to inhibition of the phosphatase as such. 3. This conclusion was verified by isolating pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate complex, free of phosphatase, from hearts of control and diabetic rats an from heart mitochondria incubed for 1min (control) or 6min with respiratory substrates. The rates of re-activation of the inactive complexes were then measured with preparations of ox heart or rat heart phosphatase. The rates were lower (relative to controls) with inactive complex from hearts of diabetic rats or from heart mitochondria incubated for 6min with respiratory substrates. 4. The incorporation of 32Pi into inactive complex took 6min to complete in rat heart mitocondria. The extent of incorporation was consistent with three or four sites of phosphorylation in rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. 5. It is suggested that phosphorylation of sites additional to an inactivating site may inhibit the conversion of inactive complex into active complex by the phosphatase in heart mitochondria from alloxan-diabetic or 48h-starved rats or in mitochondria incubated for 6min with respiratory substrates.</AbstractText>"}

The results suggest that the test is a simple, cheap, and reliable procedure for the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and is suitable for both specialized units and general hospitals. It is particularly useful in the differential diagnosis of patients with steatorrhoea or obstructive jaundice and can often distinguish between malignant and benign lesions, as well as indicating the site of the obstruction. It is of lesser value in the diagnosis of abdominal pain.</AbstractText>"}

Comparison was made to white adipose tissue (WAT) where PEPCK activity is known to be glucocorticoid regulated. PEPCK activity in BAT did not respond to adrenalectomy or dexamethasone, whereas WAT activity was increased and decreased, respectively, by these maneuvers. Three conditions were found in which BAT PEPCK activity was stimulated: 1) fasting, 2) feeding a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet, and 3) during the neonatal period. In each case glucocorticoid treatment prevented the stimulation in PEPCK activity and restored the enzyme to base-line levels. In conditions 1 and 2, enzyme activity was also stimulated in WAT, but in contradistinction to BAT, glucocorticoid administration reduced activity to low levels significantly below base-line activity. Two conditions were found which suppressed PEPCK activity in BAT: exposure to a cold environment and feeding a high-protein/low-fat diet. WAT PEPCK was unaltered by exposure to cold. Thus, differences in PEPCK regulation between BAT and WAT were demonstrated, and the response to glucocorticoids was unique in BAT.</AbstractText>"}

Increased insulin binding was found in cells from diabetic rats, and this was due to an increased number of insulin receptors rather than a change in receptor affinity. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was decreased in adipocytes from diabetic rats when the data are expressed in absolute terms or as percent increased above basal. Although the absolute rate of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport was decreased in adipocytes from diabetic rats, the percent increase above basal of insulin-stimulated glucose transport was not decreased. In conclusion, although the cellular insulin insensitivity exists in adipocytes from diabetic rats, the number of insulin receptors was increased, coupling between insulin receptors and the glucose transport system is intact in adipocytes from diabetic rats, and a defect in intracellular glucose metabolism rather than glucose transport plays a major role in the insulin insensitivity of adipocytes from diabetic rats.</AbstractText>"}

After the development of the chromatographically purified insulins they are to be found significantly reduced, though still particular cases are observed. The simultaneous occurrence of insulin allergy and insulin resistance seems to be not too rare. The immediate type allergy to insulin is mostly released by the presence of IgE-antibodies. Another but not at all rare allergic reaction is the Arthus phenomenon, released by IgG-antibodies. For diagnosis of these allergic states intradermal skin tests with various insulins are used. Also specific IgE-antibodies are to be measured radioimmunologically lately. There is a strong correlation between the outcome of the allergic reactions and the definite degree of the specific IgE-antibodies. Low levels of specific IgE are found in insulin treated diabetics without any visible allergic reactions to insulin. This fact proves that the hormone, though being a clean insulin of a very high degree, is the antigen itself. Not only immunologic mechanism, but also other exogenic influences cause allergic reactions of the immediate type to insulin.</AbstractText>"}

In a first group of ten patients, periods of isolated high glycosuria were obtained by giving an oral glucose load. The second group consisted of ten patients with a severe endogenous insulin deficiency. The subjects of this latter group were investigated before and after a few days of insulin therapy. In group I, the oral glucose load induced a significant increase in the intestinal calcium absorption and had a tendency to lower the urinary calcium excretion. Furthermore, an inverse relationship was found between the changes in the intestinal calcium absorption and the variations of the urinary calcium excretion. In group II, both intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of calcium fell significantly after recovery of satisfactory metabolic control by insulin therapy. From the results as obtained in group I one can conclude that glucose enhances the calcium transfer from the luminal to the serosal pole of both intestinal and renal tubular cells. During severe ketosis as observed in group II, calcium metabolism is considerably accelerated and the increase in the intestinal calcium absorption rate may be interpreted as compensatory mechanism for the high urinary loss of calcium.</AbstractText>"}

The present study was thus designed to assess the effect of L-dopa on the pituitary gland to secrete the growth hormone in the normal subject and the study was further extended to compare the response of the pituitary secretion of the growth hormone following the administration of L-dopa between in the patient with diabetes mellitus and in the normal subject. In the present experiment, 5 normal subjects and 11 diabetes mellitus without obesity were employed and they received a 30 min infusion of 200 mg L-dopa dissolved in 200 ml physiological saline. In normal subjects, serum growth hormone concentration measured by radio-immunoassay was started to increase within 10 min after L-dopa administration and maximum value of serum growth hormone was obtained 60 min after the drug, mean values of it, 30 ng/ml of serum. Then it was declined sharply upto the values of 2-3 ng/ml. In the patients with diabetes mellitus, on the other hand, maximum value of serum concentration of the growth hormone was only approximately 5 ng/ml of serum obtained between 45 and 75 min after the administration of L-dopa. No changes in the serum concentration of IRI (Immunoreactive insulin) and of blood sugar values were observed by the infusion of L-dopa in both normal subjects and diabetes mellitus. From the above mentioned facts, it was concluded that the ability of pituitary gland to secrete the growth hormone was considerably impaired in diabetics when it was compared with normal subjects.</AbstractText>"}

The experimental increase in FFA by a neutral fat infusion in 8 normal subjects decreased this oxidation in spite of the insulin rise. In a group of 5 non-obese, non-ketotic insulin-deficient diabetics, carbohydrate oxidation was found to be normal and directly correlated with plasma glucose levels. On the other hand, in 7 obese diabetics with high plasma insulin levels carbohydrate oxidation was found to be low, suggesting that carbohydrate intolerance could result from the non-oxidation of glucose. This study shows heterogeneity of diabetes, since glucose intolerance could result from non-oxidation of glucose as well as from insufficient pancreatic secretion.</AbstractText>"}

The method of sequential centrifugation has been used to obtain fluid samples from both the renal papilla and inner medulla of the rat.2. Experiments were carried out on Brattleboro rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (DI; homozygous recessive), and on their (heterozygous) litter-mates with normal quantities of neurohypophysial vasopressin. Initial classification of the animals by measurement of urine volume and osmolality was confirmed by post-mortem bio-assay of the pituitary glands, in thirty-five out of forty-seven animals.3. In rats with DI, urine osmolalities comparable to those of heterozygous rats were obtained after four daily injections of 1 u. Pitressin Tannate in Oil (PTO). Under these conditions, when dehydration was superimposed for 72 hr, urine osmolality did not increase markedly. In heterozygous rats dehydrated for the same period of time, urine osmolality increased by some twofold.4. In rats with DI, the administration of PTO induced a rise of both sodium and urea concentrations in renal fluids and in urine. Dehydration during PTO administration caused a further rise of urea concentrations only. Dehydration per se significantly raised urinary and renal fluid urea concentrations, but sodium concentrations did not rise.5. In heterozygous rats dehydration per se increased both urea and sodium concentrations in renal fluids and urine.6. The evidence is discussed that the action of vasopressin involves factors apart from increasing the permeability of the distal nephron to water and urea.</AbstractText>"}

This association was time and temperature-dependent and was absolutely dependent on the presence of exogenous ATP and CoASH and partially dependent on exogenous carnitine. Carnitine dependence was enhanced at lower concentrations of [(14)C]palmitate. At 6.5 micro M [(14)C]palmitate (molar ratio of palmitate to albumin equal to 0.54), the rate of association was linear for 20 sec and was increased more than 100% in the presence of carnitine. Carnitine-dependent association was inhibited by 2-bromopalmitate, an inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferase I, but not by (+)-octanoylcarnitine, a presumed inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferase II. The association of [(14)C]palmitate with mitochondria was enhanced from 190 to 330% in mitochondria isolated from fasted animals and from 160 to 230% in mitochondria isolated from diabetic, ketotic animals as compared to control animals. The enhanced association with mitochondria from fasted animals was inhibited by 2-bromopalmitate. These studies demonstrate a method of evaluating fatty acid association with mitochondria which, because of its dependence on carnitine and carnitine acyltransferase I activity, most likely represents true uptake into mitochondria. Furthermore, these studies indicate that the carnitine-dependent uptake of fatty acids into mitochondria is enhanced in the two ketotic states evaluated and that the carnitine acyltransferase system may be a regulatory site in ketone body production.</AbstractText>"}

The depression of 45Ca washout diminished after culture of the islets in a serum-free medium and it was absent in islets taken from mice homozygous for the gene diabetes. The glucose effect became less pronounced when 50 micron D-600, an inhibitor of the calcium inward transport, was added to the calcium-deficient perfusion medium and abolished in the presence of 20 mM Ca-EGTA. The inhibition of the 45Ca washout observed is not necessarily due to a direct glucose interaction with the outward calcium transport but may also result from stimulation of the uptake and intracellular trapping of the cation.</AbstractText>"}

The same comparisons were made between normal and diabetic Lewis rats recovered after fetal pancreas transplantation in the kidney capsule. In an attempt to clarify the relationship between the metabolic and feeding diurnal patterns, a detailed study of the meal pattern of vagotomized and transplanted rats was performed. It was shown that 1) a truncular vagotomy abolished both the metabolic and feeding diurnal cyclicity; 2) both the metabolic and feeding diurnal rhythms were maintained in case of a selective denervation beta-cells. The relationship between the metabolic and feeding diurnal rhythms and the role of the vagus nerve are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The minimum effective dose of McN-3495 that lowers fasting blood glucose and improves glucose tolerance was found to be about 2.5 to 5 mg-per kilogram, per os, except in fasted monkeys, in which a tenfold greater potency was observed. When McN-3495 was given repeatedly for three to five days, no tolerance to the hypoglycemic activity occurred and no changes in other biochemical parameters were observed. In addition to being three to four times more potent than tolbutamide, McN-3495 also differs from the sulfonylureas in lowering blood glucose concentrations of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and db/db mice, and, moreover, oral administration to normal fasted dogs did not produce the characteristic rise in insulin concentrations observed with tolbutamide. Furthermore, unlike the biguanides, McN-3495 can lower dog and rat fasting blood glucose concentrations and can improve glucose tolerance whether the glucose is administered orally or parenterally. However, McN-3495, as phenformin, fails to work in totally depancreatized dogs.</AbstractText>"}

The only clinical difference between calcifying and non-calcifying forms was a higher incidence of steatorrhea in the first group. Cholelithiasis was present in 17 p.cent, alcoholic cirrhosis in 17 p.cent and a peptic ulcer in 24 p.cent of the whole series. Seventy two patients underwent surgery either for a complication in their course (attack of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudo-cyst, cholestatic jaundice, segmental portal hypertension or antro-pyloroduodenal stenosis) or for cholelithiasis. Course assessed in 70 patients studied for more than 2 years was regressive in almost 60 p.cent of cases.

It was found that the two-minute injection elicited faster and significantly higher absolute hormonal output in both normals and diabetics, and that on both tests the normal subjects secreted significantly more insulin than did the mild diabetics. Comparison of respective 'insulinogenic indexes' (net insulin output per unit of glycemic stimulus) showed that the corrected early insulin responses were in fact the same on both the five-minute and two-minute tests in normal subjects, and also in mild diabetics; but that the corrected insulin output was still twice as great in control subjects on both tests. It was also found that obese mild diabetics had significantly greater absolute insulin responses to both the five-minute and two-minute glucose injections than did their nonobese counterparts. These findings reconfirm that the earliest clinically recognizable state of diabetes mellitus is characterized by an impaired initial insulin secretory response to glycemic stimulus. They also indicate that valid interpretations of the influence of mild diabetes per se on the early insulin response can only be drawn from data obtained in nonobese individuals.

When fed a standard Purina Laboratory Chow diet instead of a leafy vegetable diet, these animals develop the characteristic signs of diabetes mellitus. Tritiated leucine was injected intravenously into pairs of sand rats (one on a vegetable diet and one on a Purina Laboratory Chow diet). Two pairs of animals were sacrificed at 5-, 20- and 60-minute intervals, and pancreatic tissue was studied by electron microscopic autoradiography. At 5 minutes, the relative grain density was greatest over the rough endoplasmic reticulum; at 20 minutes it was greatest over the Golgi complex and at 60 minutes, over the granules. There were no statistically significant differences in the relative grain densities over the rough endoplasmic reticulum, over the Golgi complex or over the secretion granules between the sand rats on the vegetable diet and Chow diet. These results show that in the early phase of the development of diabetes mellitus, the pattern of protein synthesis in the beta cells of the normal and diabetic sand rat compares with that of other endocrine glands. The tritiated leucine was apparently incorporated into the newly synthesized secretory product in the rough endoplasmic reticulum during the first 5 minutes. The formed product migrated to the Golgi complex at 20 minutes, and at 1 hour was seen mainly over the light granules. In addition, there was no obvious difference in this pattern of protein synthesis between the normal and diabetic sand rats. This suggests that the secretory product, considered to be mainly insulin, is produced in the usual or in increased amounts, but it is not fully utilized by the diabetic animal and remains in circulation, thus increasing the plasma insulin level.</AbstractText>"}

Thrombocytopenia was uncommon in the uraemic patients but there was reduced platelet retention in glass bead columns and platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin was slower and less complete than normal. The rate of platelet disaggregation in uraemic patients was significantly reduced. The abnormalities tended to be more severe in more uraemic subjects. In normal subjects no inter-relationships were observed between the various measurements of platelet activity. In patients there were significant interrelationships between the measurements of platelet aggregation with ADP and thrombin and between the measurements of aggregation and retention in glass bead columns. It is suggested that if a common pathway is involved in these reactions it is adversely affected in uraemia. Plasma coagulation defects were uncommon and present in only five of the uraemic subjects. Impaired prothrombin consumption apparently due to defective platelet function was present in half the patients but was not detected by a kaolin activation method. Although platelet coagulation function was activated during ADP aggregation and disaggregation in normal and uraemic subjects, it did not correlate in the latter with impairment of aggregation. It is suggested that aggregation and activation of platelet coagulant activity are not necessarily related aspects of platelet function. An effect of uraemic plasma on normal platelets was demonstrated by mixing experiments consistent with a humoral cause for the uraemic platelet defects.</AbstractText>"}

Both groups had comparable control cell counts that were unaffected by glucose tolerance testing but altered significantly by endotoxin. Different patterns of response to endotoxin were observed for different circulating cell types. The response of diabetics was parallel to that of normals but showed lower neutrophil and monocyte rebound, longer lasting depression of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and greater rebound of basophils on the day following endotoxin exposure. Characterization of distinctive normal response patterns of circulating leukocyte populations to endotoxin and comparison with responses in diabetes revealed abnormalities under conditions of stress that may impair the diabetic's ability to cope with acute infection.</AbstractText>"}

In the present work we have measured the liver-cell concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glycerol 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, malate, oxaloacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, 2-oxoglutarate, ribulose 5-phosphate as pentose phosphates, gluconate 6-phosphate, isocitrate, aspartate in untreated and treated rats (alloxan-diabetic, insulin-treated alloxan-diabetic or starved rats as well as rats fed on carbohydrate- or fat diet). Through analysis of the algebraic correlation between metabolite concentrations, we arrived at the following statements: 1. Under certain physiological conditions the concentration of some metabolites in one compartment determines their total quantity in the cell; 2. NADP and NADPH are comparted within the cytosol; 3. Reduced cosubstrate/oxidized cosubstrate ratios of some enzymic reactions are under certain physiological conditions in mutual equilibrium; 4. Such relationships are first verified after treatment and therefore characterize the metabolite status.</AbstractText>"}

In 10 newly discovered diabetics the average P50 at in vivo pH was normal prior to insulin (26.2 mm Hg), decreased to 24.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) on the day following the initial insulin administration, and was within normal limits (26.9 mm Hg) when the diabetes was finally well controlled and red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) had risen to elevated levels. Oxygen affinity of hemoglobin was closely correlated with the content of red cell 2,3-DPG (r = 0.61, p less than 0.001) but was unrelated to the level of hemoglobin Alc. In 40 juvenile patients the average P50 was also normal prior to insulin administration but was significantly lower 3-4 hr after they had received their usual insulin dose (p less than 0.001). The study indicates that insulin administration to diabetics with high blood glucose levels may lead to transient decreases in red cell 2,3-DPG and in oxygen-releasing capacity of the red blood cells.</AbstractText>"}

There was a significant age-related decline in CBF in both groups, which suggests that diabetes does not affect the rate of decrease of CBF with age. After CO2 challenge CBF increased in most of the controls; in the patients CBF increased in 23, decreased in 26, and remained stable in 10. Thus the reactivity of cerebral blood vessels in diabetics is altered. Diabetics have diminished cerebrovascular reserve and are thus at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease because they are unable to compensate when necessary with an increased CBF.</AbstractText>"}

In the first case the clinical symptoms were diabetes insipidus associated with nodular pulmonary infiltrates and a retroperitoneal mass. In the second case, respiratory failure together with nodular pulmonary infiltrates dominated the picture. The third case was characterized principally by neurological symptoms and paraparesia secondary to the compression of the spinal cord by an intra-rachidial growth. In cases 1 and 3, X-ray studies of the skeleton showed a very peculiar involvement of bone shafts. Anatomical studies either by repeated biopsies or at autopsy showed that in all three cases the disease was characterized by disseminated fibrosclerosis. In the first two cases the involvement was most marked in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, lungs and bones; in the third case the involvement was demonstrated in the intra-rachidial lumbar region, retroperitoneum and in bones. In the first case there was also involvement of the base of the cranium, which was responsible for the clinical symptoms of diabetes insipidus. In this case repeated biopsies and immunological studies suggested that disseminated fibrosclerosis might be related to Weber-Christian's disease.</AbstractText>"}

The formation of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (2-HB) has been studied by animal experiments. 2. 2-HB was excreted in the urine together with lactic acid following intravenous administration of huge amounts of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (sodium salt) to a dog. 3. Rats made diabetic by an injection of streptozotocin were found to excrete large quantities of 2HB in the urine (up to 300 mumol/24 h) together with the development of ketoacidosis. 4. The use of 14-C-labelled precursors clearly showed that the amino acids methionine, threonine and homoserine can be converted to 2-HB. 5. 2-Aminobutyric acid is also converted to 2-HB, with 2-oxobutyric acid as an intermediate metabolite. The ratio between the urinary concentrations of 2-HB and 2-oxobutyric acid was increased by the ingestion of ethanol. 6. In normal rats neither a prolonged fasting period nor loading with large doses of methionine, threonine and homoserine resulted in the excretion of 2-HB. 7. The mechanisms behind the formation of 2-HB are discussed, and it is concluded that an increased NADH2/NAD ratio in the cytoplasma is the most important factor.</AbstractText>"}

This finding supports existing evidence that H.D.L. facilitates the uptake of cholesterol from peripheral tissues and its transport to the liver for catabolism and excretion. Plasma-H.D.L., is reduced in several conditions associated with an increased risk of future ischaemic heart-disease (I.H.D.), namely hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaimia, male sex, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, while subjects with existing clinical I.H.D. have lower levels of H.D.L. than healthy subjects within the same community. It is proposed that a reduction of plasma-H.D.L. concentration may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, and hence I.H.D., by impairing the clearance of cholesterol from the arterial wall.</AbstractText>"}

These facts are compatible with a bihormonal-abnormality hypothesis, which holds that the major consequence of absolute or relative insulin lack is glucose underutilisation and that absolute or relative glucagon excess is the principal factor in the over-production of glucose in diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The time-course for the induction of hepatic glucokinase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, liver-type and muscle-type pyruvate kinases in reponse to various diets and insulin has been investigated over the first 48h of change in both diabetic and non-diabetic rats. 2. The results are consistent with there being separate regulatory mechanisms for the induction of each of the three key enzymes, that is for glucokinase, phosphofructokinase and liver-type pyruvate kinase. 3. To investigate the possibility that induction of these enzymes is mediated through specific metabolites a full metabolite profile has been determined under conditions identical with those in the induction experiments and the results examined for correlations between metabolite concentrations and enzyme activities. 4. Several such relationships were detected and those between glucokinase activity and the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotides and between liver-type pyruvate kinase activity and the concentrations of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and pyruvate are discussed in relation to the concept of inducing metabolites. 5. It is suggested that the induction of glycolytic enzymes by insulin may be secondary to the changes in the concentration of specific hepatic metabolites brought about by the acute effects of the hormone. 6. The details of the metabolite concentrations in the various experimental states have been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50021 at the British Library (Lending Division) (formerly the National Lending Library for Science and Technology), Boston Spa, Yorks.

The lyophilized whole digest, containing less than 2% of unchanged hormone, had an average of 2.3 new amino-terminal groups per mole. The digest had the same potency as the native hormone (a) in causing weight gain in hypophysectomized rats; (b) in stimulating somatomedin production in hypophysectomized rats; (c) in stimulating upake of [(3)H]leucine into isolated diaphragm of hypophysectomized rats; (d) in accelerating transport of [(14)C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid into isolated diaphragm of hypophysectomized rats; (e) in stimulating uptake of [3-0-methyl-(14)C]glucose by isolated adipose tissue of hypophysectomized rats; (f) in accelerating conversion of [(14)C]glucose to (14)CO(2) by isolated epididymal adipose tissue of hypophysectomized rats. The digest also caused glucosuria in partially pancreatectomized rats treated with dexamethasone. These metabolic actions of plasmin-digested hGH in the array of animal tests were confirmed by comparable effects elicited in 11 human subjects (nine pituitary-deficient children and adolescents and two nondeficient adults). A single injection of the plasmin digest caused an increase in plasma free fatty acids and a fall in plasma amino acids. Seven daily injections caused positive balances of nitrogen, phosphorous, sodium, and potassium, gain in body weight, and in two of three subjects impairment of glucose tolerance. The potency of the plasmin digest in producing these metabolic effects in man was comparable to that of native hGH.Thus, 2-3 bonds in the hGH molecule can be cleaved by plasmin without impairing the hormone's growthpromoting, anabolic, diabetogenic, and adipokinetic actions for rat and man.</AbstractText>"}

Abnormal nerve conduction was demonstrated in nine of these and in one further patient who had no abnormal neurological signs. The occurrence of a neuropathy (in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, active chronic hepatitis as well as in alcoholic cirrhosis) could not be related to liver function, although it was associated with higher IgA and IgM values. Clinical diabetes was present in six of the 14 patients with neuropathy but there was no relation in the non-diabetic patients between neuropathy and minor impairment of carbohydrate tolerance. Those with neuropathy had a significantly higher incidence of oesophageal varices and there was also a relationship to a history of previous encephalopathy. Sural nerve biopsy was carried out on 14 patients, eight of whom had clinical or electrodiagnostic evidence of neuropathy. Single nerve fibres were examined by teasing and in all nerves histological evidence was found of an indolent process which had damaged whole Schwann cells and which resulted in demyelination and remyelination. Diabetic angiopathy was not seen and axonal degeneration, which was never severe, was found in all disease groups equally.</AbstractText>"}

Plasma levels and excreta were monitored using the 14C-labelled compound and/or a specific radioimmunoassay. Following oral administration of a 30 mg tablet a maximal plasma level of approximately 600 ng/ml was attained after 2 to 3 h. The compound was eliminated mainly with the bile. Urinary excretion amounted to about 5% only. Comparison of diabetic patients with or without concomitant renal insufficiency did not reveal significant differences with respect to the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug. This holds true also for administration following a multiple dosage regimen where even three doses of 60 mg each a day, did not result in elevated blood levels in either group. AR-DF 16 is metabolized mainly to four products, which were identified besides unchanged drug in bile, stool and urine. All excreta showed quite a similar pattern of distribution. In plasma, however, unchanged drug accounted for at least 80% of total radioactivity up to 8 h besides some biotransformed products, mainly AR-DF 33.</AbstractText>"}

After a critical review of the recent literature about insulin antibodies both without and after exogenous immunization, the following results are presented and discussed. 1) - In 163 diabetic subjects, never previously treated with insulin, the mean value of IB was X = 0,008 mUml (sigma = 0,023 . Sx = 0,002). 2) - In 221 longterm insulin-treated diabetics the mean value of IB was X = 1,50 mU/ml (sigma = 2,15 . Sx = 0,145). 3) -In 46 insulin-dependent diabetics, serial determinations of IB allowed to follow the insulin antibody production during a 5 years treatment with monocomponent insulin )Lente MC). No or slight antibody formation was observed in newly diagnosed patients, never previously treated with insulin. High antibody starting levels showed tendency to a gradual reduction, after switching from conventional insulin treatment to the monocomponent one. These modifications in the IB values have been studied in correlation with the clinical course of conditions possibly referred to an immunologic pathogenesis, such as: brittle diabetes, high insulin requirement, insulin allergy, insulin lipoatrophy, diabetic microangiopathy. No significant variations in IB values were observed after viral infections.</AbstractText>"}

It was established that the frequency of women suffering from spontaneous abortions (SA) was increased as well as the SA frequency among all the pregnancies with natural results in heterozygotes for the PKU gene; it was also established that the frequency of stillborns and of the early mortality of newborns was considerably higher among women with LDM. In both these groups the frequency of congenital malformations among the newborns was also relatively high. In women heterozygous for the PKU gene the pathogenic effect was realized only during the first three months of pregnancy, while in women with LDM it was realized through all the period of pregnancy. The heterozygosity of women for MD proved not to be pathogenic for the progeny. Possible mechanisms realizing the effect of heterozygosity of women for the abovementioned recessive genes during pregnancy are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Accumulation of insulin antibodies with formation of insulin-antibody complexes is pointed out as the prevalent cause of insulin resistance in advanced age. Intravenous insulin treatment with massive doses ensured a beneficial effect. Achrestic diabetes associated with peripheral resistance is regarded as the cause of insulin resistance in juvenile patients possessing no major amounts of antibody. Muscle tissue obtained from these patients showed an insulin resistant impairment of glucose consumption and of Na-transport. This is consistent with the peripheral pathomechanism underlying this condition. A feedback mechanism elicited by latent hypoglycaemia may be the cause of spurious insulin resistance.</AbstractText>"}

No changes in morphology could be detected, suggesting some changes in the biochemical membrane structure that cause the findings of increased permeability of the diabetic basement membrane for plasma proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Control experiments using uninjected or vehicle-injected dogs were also performed. Blood sugar and serum immunoreactive insulin basal levels were not affected by testosterone propionate and/or its vehicle, but serum free fatty acids basal values were increased. The blood sugar curve during the test observed in the dogs in the three conditions differed little; neither glucose space nor glucose 'k' value were affected by treatments. Testosterone administration reduced by 50% the serum immunoreactive insulin peak following glucose load, as compared to vehicle-injected controls. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinaemia induced a fall in serum free fatty acid levels in control groups, followed by a recovery period at the end of the test. Either the fall or the recovery were more intense in testosterone-treated dogs than in vehicle-injected controls. Results are discussed, emphasizing that testosterone exerts a moderate 'diabetogenic' action in male dog, inasmuch as although it intensely promotes lipid mobilization and moderately reduces the insulin response to glucose, fails to induce any glucose intolerance.</AbstractText>"}

Linoleic and arachidonic acids were tested. It was found that in both liver and testis linoleic acid was desaturated to gamma-linolenic acid (18:3) when the conditions were exclusively desaturating. Diabetes deceased the 6-desaturase activity of both tissues. In elongating and desaturating conditions linoleic acid was converted to 18:3, 20:2, 20:3, 20:4, 22:2, 22:5 and 24:2 in both tissues. Alloxan diabetes decreased the activity of the reactions controlled by the 6-desaturase reducing the conversion to 18:3 in both tissues and to 20:4 only in liver. The elongating reactions were not significantly modified. When only elongating conditions were tested, either liver or testis synthetized only 20:2, 22:2 and 24:2 from linoleic acid and 22:4 from arachidonic acid. The elongating activity for both fatty acids was not decreased by diabetes. Therefore, it was proved that alloxan diabetes interferes with the metabolism of linoleic acid in both tissues, decreasing only the desaturation reaction, whereas the elongation of the fatty acid is not reduced.</AbstractText>"}

The previous intake of each of these substances among 519 patients with histopathologically confirmed bladder cancer and an equal number of matching controls in metropolitan Baltimore did not differ significantly in frequency, quantity, or duration. These normal findings persisted after simultaneous adjustment for the effects of smoking, occupation, age, diabetes mellitus, and a number of other potentially  confounding factors. They are substantiated by the failure of the relative risk of bladder cancer to increase with increasing exposure to artificial sweeteners. It is concluded that neither saccharin nor cyclamate is likely to be carcinogenic in man, at least at the moderate dietary ingestion levels reported by the patient sample.</AbstractText>"}

The neurosecretory fibers, especially in the neurohypophysis, show numerous signs of autophagy and tubular proliferation of the axoplasmic reticulum. These structural alterations, as well as the nematosomes of nucleolus-like bodies encountered in the perikarya, may be related to the chronic hyperactivity of the neurons. They can be reduced by administration of exogenous vasopressin. The numerous liposomes in the pituicytes are paralleled in the neuronal perikarya by a great number of lysosomes. Small dense core vesicles observed in the neurosecretory endings and perikarya may indicate a secretory product distinct from oxytocin and vasopressin. In the homozygous Brattleboro rat, endings of the aminergic type are more numerous than in the normal rat. With respect to the role they may play in the secretory processes, their increase might be secondary to the vasopressin deficiency.</AbstractText>"}

The islets are made up of a centrally located mass of insulin-producing B-cells surrounded by a peripheral rim of A- and D-cells. Most islets are richly supplied by unmyelinated nerve fibers which terminate on all three cell types with cholinergic synaptic endings. Early changes in islet fine structure due to ketosis comprise degranulation of A-cells combined with signs of crinophagia of alpha-granules. After the manifestation of hyperglycemia, degranulation of B-cells is followed by deposition of glycogen which in the late phase of the diabetic syndrome forms large masses obscuring the regular cellular organelles. In six- to nine-month hyperglycemic animals degenerative changes are also observed in D-cells in the form of autophagic vacuoles.</AbstractText>"}

Monocomponent (MC) insulins are free of these contaminants. In 49 insulin-treated diabetic patients, antibodies were found to insulin (94%), pro-insulin (68%) and PP (68%). Antibodies to glucagon and somatostatin were not detected. There was a significantly lower mean maximum binding and titre of insulin and PP antibodies and total circulating insulin (i.e. antibody bound and free) in patients receiving MC insulin. In patients treated with MC insulins for longer than 2 years there was a significant fall in the mean maximum binding of insulin and total serum insulin, but no consistent change in diabetes control and daily insulin dose. It seems that except in the special instances of fat atrophy, insulin allergy and certain cases of insulin resistance, there is no need to resort to MC insulin.</AbstractText>"}

Both drugs were ineffective in patients with ADH-resistant diabetes insipidus. Administration of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin did not cause any side effect.

The Chinese hamsters were most susceptible. Only in this species did a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight cause blood-glucose elevations and pancreatic islet damage. At a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight of N-nitrosomethylurea, blood-glucose elevations were recorded in the golden hamster together with damage to the islets and the exocrine pancreatic parenchyma. A toxic dose of 200 mg/kg body weight resulted in hyperglycemia and islet cell destruction in the rat and in slight alterations in the islets of mice. N-nitrosomethylurea was non-diabetogenic to guinea pigs and sand rats. The ethyl derivate of nitrosourea was less toxic and diabetogenic to the Chinese hamsters in comparison with the methyl derivate.</AbstractText>"}

Cephalometry, the technique of which is simple and well documented, is irreplaceable as a method of monitoring high risk pregnancies and as a means of detecting anomalies of foetal growth. However, when there is evidence of chronic foetal distress, thoracometry can compensate for the diagnostic shortcomings of cephalometry. In cases of diabetic pregnancy only thoracometry is able to detect foetal oedema. Combination of the two parameters makes possible, when only one measurement is made, a good approximation of the weight of the foetus even in pathological pregnancies.</AbstractText>"}

A suggestion has been raised that the results of the L/S ratio should be viewed with caution in predicting lung maturity in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes (8). We report our findings on 52 insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies which involved 90 estimations of the L/S ratio on the amniotic fluid. In all cases, the L/S ratio accurately reflected lung maturity, as no hyaline membrane disease (HMD) was observed with a L/S ratio greater than 2. There was no significant difference in the proportion of mature fetal lung between insulin-dependent diabetics and controls for each week of pregnancy between 32 and 38 weeks. There is no statistical difference in the mature L/S ratio between classes B + C and D + F diabetics.</AbstractText>"}

Blood viscosity was found to be statistically significantly decreased in the alloxan diabetic group in comparison to the control group. The decrease is attributed to a slight decrease in mean hematocrit and mean plasma viscosity of the diabetic animals. The possible mechanisms of these changes are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Normalization of the fasting blood glucose was not accompanied by any elevation in the pre-treatment fasting immunoreactive insulin level. Insulin antibodies appeared in 2 patients on the second week of insulin treatment, in 6 others within 87 days. In 4 patients no antibodies were found 200 days after the start of insulin. The appearance of antibodies was accompanied in two patients by a decrease in insulin requirement, in others there was no change. When antibodies were present, the total maximum insulin binding capacity was 4 to 12 U/l, but the total insulin constituted only 3 to 36% of the binding capacity. Insulin wastage caused by the destruction of the immune complexes was calculated to be 0.35 to 5.6 U/die only, and this explains the negligible effect of insulin antibodies on insulin requirement in non-resistant patients.</AbstractText>"}

The fundamental lesion is one of the glomerular basement membrane, a complex layer of collage-like and other peptides; thickening of this membrane, seen microscopically, is due to the presence of an increased amount of membrane material of normal composition. There is little reliable evidence relating the frequency of glomerulosclerosis to the quality of control of the diabetic state, but indirect evidence from patients with secondary diabetes and from a variety of studies in animals indicates strongly that the glomerular lesion is a consequence of the abnormal metabolic state and can be prevented by adequate treatment of the diabetes. A concept of the pathogenesis of the glomerular lesions and renal failure is presented, but there remain large gaps in knowledge of the mechanisms involved. Treatment of chronic renal failure by maintenance renal dialysis and renal transplantation is not as successful in persons with diabetes as in those without this condition; however, the results appear to be improving, and transplantation particularly holds much promise.</AbstractText>"}

The breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier could be quantitated by vitreous fluorophotometry, which revealed very high concentrations of fluorescein in the vitreous after intravenous administration. The decrease in retinal blood flow appeared to be due mainly to appreciable narrowing of the retinal arteriolar vessels.</AbstractText>"}

It has been suggested that herein lies an enigma, since it is believed that these people are considerably exposed to the conventional risk factors for CHD. To test this belief I have assessed the exposure of Black people, in time and degree, to the following CHD risk factors: affluence, age, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, dietary excess, smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes, obesity, hyperuricaemia and hyperinsulinism. Among males only hypertension, and among females only hypertension and obesity, emerged as prominent factors. However, neither of these is significantly atherogenic in the social, nutritional and metabolic milieu in which Blacks generally live, and obesity is a doubtful atherogenic factor, even in westernized populations. It is therefore concluded that the rarity of CHD in Blacks is not enigmatic, but is appropriate to their environmental circumstances.</AbstractText>"}

Seventy-four per cent of the diabetics studied within three months of diagnosis had islet-cell antibodies but only 20% of those studied three years or more after diagnosis. Persistence of these antibodies was associated with a high prevalence of thyrogastric autoimmunity, which suggests that some cases have an aetiology similar to that of 'polyendocrine' autoimmune disease. Retinopathy or nephropathy, or both, was present in 10 diabetics, who were all members of 'autoimmune' families, in which one or more members had organ-specific antibodies. Nine of the 10 healthy relatives with islet-cell antibodies and all families with more than one diabetic were also in this autoimmune group. These data suggest that an autoimmune factor may contribute to juvenile diabetes and that such autoimmune diabetes has a tendency to run in families and may be more likely to cause complications.</AbstractText>"}

None of this group with idiopathic diabetes mellitus developed any clinical evidence of exocrine pancreatic disease over the next five years. Mild abnormalities of exocrine pancreatic function in newly diagnosed patients with diabetes but without clinical evidence of pancreatic disease do not usually develop into overt pancreatic disease, and are therefore probably clinically unimportant.</AbstractText>"}

In each case there was partial to total failure of response to the initial administration of ADH which was slowly corrected by continued administration. This initial failure can lead to misinterpretation of the dehydration test unless the medullary solute washout effect is taken into account in chronically polyuric patients.Treatment consisted of thiazides and/or chlorpropamide. All cases responded well.The response to chlorpropamide suggests that the failure of ADH production is not complete in these patients, and that the major defect is a failure of ADH release in response to normal stimuli. Chlorpropamide may act by either facilitating ADH release or by synergistically interacting with available ADH at the tubular level.</AbstractText>"}

Case histories with review of the literature on 18 cases of chlorpropamide induced hyponatremia].","Journal":"Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift","Date":"Jul 08 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A case of chlorpropamide-induced, symptomatic hyponatremia in a diabetic patient is reported. The hyponatremia was associated with loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms caused reduced food intake which provoked severe hypoglycemia with disturbed consciousness. The hyponatremia developed when the chlorpropamide doses were increased from 400 to 600 mg/day. Withdrawal of chlorpropamide was followed by remission of hyponatremia. Chlorpropamide-induced hyponatremia is a rare complication and is due to an antidiuretic effect of chlorpropamide caused by increased secretion of adiuretin and potentiation of the effect of chlorpropamide caused by increased secretion of adiuretin and potentiation of the effect of adiuretin in the tubuli of the kidney. This case report and the analysis of 18 published cases in the literature show the following characteristics for chlorpropamide-induced hyponatremia: (1) Hyponatremia is a rare complication in the treatment of diabetics with chlorpropamide. The patients typically are female and over sixty. The dosage of chlorpropamide usually was 500 mg daily or even more. (2) Hyponatremia is often unrecognized for a long time because the symptoms are not specific. The characteristic symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusional state and, rarely, convulsions and coma. Recovery occurs spontaneously after withdrawal of the drug. (3) The incidence of this type of hyponatremia is increased in cases of preexisting tendency to water retention such as heart failure and renal failure, and in cases of diuretic therapy. In the light of these findings, the authors believe that chlorpropamide is no longer a drug of choice in the treatment of diabetic women, especially in cases of preexisting tendency to water retention and in diuretic therapy. In such cases, a sulfonylurea without antidiuretic effect is to be preferred.</AbstractText>"}

In an insulin-treated subgroup improvement in diabetic control, confirmed by a decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin concentrations, was accompanied by a significant rise in plasma-H.D.L.-cholesterol concentration. This result suggests that improved diabetic control may diminish the risk of premature ischaemic heart-disease. When three groups of patients on different treatments were matched for age, sex, weight, and diabetic control, diabetic patients receiving sulphonylureas had significantly lower plasma-H.D.L.-cholesterol concentrations than those receiving insulin or on diet alone, or non-diabetic controls. This association suggests that sulphonyl-urea administration may constitute a positive risk factor for ischaemic heart-disease in diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

Using 2-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, 9 different phospholipids were identified. Dynamic surface tension measurements were performed with a modified Wilhelmy balance. Five different groups of infants with typical phospholipid patterns were characterized: i.e., 1. Normal term newborn. 2. RDS in the preterm infant. 3. Acceleration of lung maturity in preterm infants without RDS. 4. Retardation in term infants with RDS. 5. Therapeutic induction of pulmonary maturity in preterm infants following maternal glucocorticoid administration. Mature lung effluent contains high concentrations of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phsophatidylglycerol (PG). In infants with RDS, PC is low and PG absent. Accelerated lung maturity was observed after chronic prenatal stress, such as prolonged rupture of the membranes, chronic vaginal bleeding, and maternal hepatitis or drug addiction. Retardation of pulmonary maturity was seen in infants with alpha-1-AT-deficiency, maternal diabetes and maternal hypothyroidism. Administration of methylprednisolone to the mother 24 h to 72h before birth induced both the synthesis of PC and PG in the preterm infants, resulting in an almost full-term phospholipid pattern as early as 31 weeks of gestation. The significance of these factors on the pathogenesis of RDS is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

They examined 32 patients with coronary disease and 19 control subjects, similar in age and body weight, divided into three subgroups: with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), suspiciously-pathological glucose tolerance (SPGT) and pathological glucose tolerance (PGT). They are led by age conformed criteria in the assessment of the blood sugar curves obtained. For a better idea about the insulin response volume, provoked by glucose loading, they compare the sums of the insulinemic values and 'insulinogenic index', among the control subjects and the patients examined. The study of the carbohydrate tolerance of the patients examined, show that manifested or suspiciously pathological deviations in carbohydrate metabolism were found in almost 60% of them. Insulinemia during the glucose loading was found to be higher than that of the control subjects, maximal point appearing later and restoration to initial values delayed. The highest absolute insulin values and increased volume of insulin secretion were established in the patients with NGT and the lowest--in patients with PGT. The highest insulinogenic index is in NGT patients and is with about 50% higher than that of the control subjects while in patients with PGT it is quite the reverse, i. e.--glucose tolerance deteriorated parallelly with the reducing of insulin response to glucose stimulus or, in other words--normal glucose tolerance in patients maintained by the increased insulin production. The correlation of blood sugar and insulinemic curves with those of triglyceridemia reveals that with blood sugar elevation and insulinemia during glucose loading--triglyceride level rapidly elevates--i.e. a positive correlation was found among blood sugar, insulinemia and triglyceridemia where triglyceridemia correlates with hyperinsulinemia more intimately than with glycemia. Basing on the data obtained and the general theoretical conditons--the problem of pathogenetic commonness (at least in certain relations) between atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes mellitus is discussed. A practical conclusion is drawn that the establishment of increased serum triglycerides and hyperinsulinism in pathological and even in still normal carbohydrate tolerance in one subject may play the role of an important diagnostic test, speaking of the possible development or for the presence of already manifested atherosclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

Maturity-onset diabetics failed to show an increase in serum GH levels after L-dopa administration, while serum peak GH values of juvenile diabetic patients were not significantly different from those of normal adults and children. Hyperglycemia thus failed to prevent L-dopa induced growth hormone response in insulin-dependent juvenile diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

The animals were divided by chance in 3 experimental and 1 control group. 1. group--Aloxanic diabetes rats: treated with 1 unit of NPH insulin every day: after the 4th day of aloxane administration, all rats were killed. 2. group--Aloxanic diabetes rats--treated for 5 days with 1 unit of NPH insulin every day; after the 5th day until the 7th they were treated with 4 units of NPH insulin and were also killed. 3. group--Hyperinsulinism rats--Normal rats were treated for 4 days with 4 units of NPH insulin every day. After the 5th day they were killed. 4. group--Control group--Normal rats, free feeding. They were observed during 4 days and were also killed. The results showed that none difference was observed in the 4 groups of rats about the total and specific activities of lactase, invertase and maltase of the small intestine. In this study, all the animals with aloxanic diabetes were treated with insulin. Then, it is possible that the insulin inhibited the stimulator effect of the diabetes upon the dissacaridases of the small intestine of the rats.</AbstractText>"}

Using the discriminant analysis, all but one of the children in the new group were correctly classified. It is interesting to notice that 'penetration' a Rorschach item indicating a disturbed body-image, has the highest absolute value of the D-estimate. A disturbed body-image development is a common feature in the diabetic group.</AbstractText>"}

They are liberated when the hormones are released; their radioimmunoassay which are methodologically more simple than that of the active nonapeptides can be used in clinical practice. Moreover, the separate assay of each major neurophysins bring a specific index of the release of each hormone. The radioimmunoassay for circulating neurophysins appears to be useful for the differential diagnosis of polyuria, water retention and hypothalamic disease. The neurophysins are however devoided of any antidiuretic or oxytocic properties and their half-lives differ slightly from that of circulating hormones: therefore a basal level or values obtained in the course of an inhibitory test must be cautiously interpreted.</AbstractText>"}

The following indices were determined: thrombocyte numer, thrombocyte adhesion and aggregation, recalcification and heparinrecalcification time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin time, coagulation retraction and thrombelastography. Data for increased blood coagulation are established in diabetics and especially in the presence of nephropathy. Most manifested are the changes in thrombocyte adhesion, in PTT, recalcification and heparin-recalcification time. Changes in thrombelastogram and the rest of the indices are less manifested. In patients with more advanced forms of nephropathy--the increased hemocoagulation is more pronounced. The changes described are considered non diabetes specific and are associated with the accompanying atherosclerosis. Those changes might indicate inclusion of anticoagulants and antiaggregating medicines in the therapeutic program of patients with diabetic nephropathy with the respective indications.</AbstractText>"}

Both drugs caused a prompt increase in urine volume and a decrease in urine osmolality with an associated decrease in urinary ADH excretion. The effects appeared to be dose related and of short duration. Tolerance to butorphanol administration was evident on repeated daily injections. The diuretic effect was not associated with alternation in creatinine excretion, but butorphanol resulted in decreased osmolal, sodium and potassium excretion. Butorphanol prevented the expected rise in urine osmolality and ADH excretion due to 31 h of dehydration. Oxilorphan did not interfere with the ability of administered ADH to cause an antidiuresis. The data indicate that these narcotic antagonists cause a diuresis by inhibiting ADH release from the neurohypophysis.</AbstractText>"}

Blood sugar levels of the KK mice did not differ markedly from those of the C57BL/6J mice at the fed state or after 8 h fasting. They were, however, significantly higher in the KK mice when fasted for 18 h. The serum IRI levels, which were at least twice as high in the KK mice, decreased more markedly after 18 h fasting. The KK mice showed impaired glucose tolerance after 8 h fasting, which became more pronounced after 18 h fasting. The insulin response to glucose in the KK mice was not altered after an 8-hour fast; it was, however, diminished greatly after an 18-hour fast. These data suggest that prolonged fasting is necessary to detect the diabetic traits in the KK mice. The C57BL/6J mice showed neither impaired glucose tolerance nor diminished insulin response to glucose at both periods of fasting. Studies with the F1 hybrids (KK male X C57BL/6J female), which carry half of the diabetic genes, suggest that the mode of inheritance of diabetes in the KK mice might be polygenic.</AbstractText>"}

The incidence of toxaemia was 55%. Insulin requirement decreased some days before delivery in 8 cases (14%). The perinatal mortality rate amounted to 17%. Birth weights were found between 2500 and 3000 g in 9 cases, below 2500 g in 8 cases with signs of intrauterine growth retardation. The majority of placentae showed medium-sized to severe diabetic disturbances of maturation on an average more severe than in diabetics without angiolopathy. A 'modification' or 'mascing' of maturation disturbances by severe toxaemia is discussed. The antenatal retardation of fetal growth in some cases was attributed in part to the diabetic maturation disturbances of the placentae. Another cause may be the defective uteroplacental circulation caused by narrowing processes of myometrial and decidual arteries in consequence of long-term diabetes and hypertension.</AbstractText>"}

The degree of severity of the disease was classified according to the schema of White. Related to the gestation period different degrees of severity of diabetes mellitus revealed nearly the same weight of the placentas. Similar relations were found referred to the height of the placenta-child-index. Implantation lesions occured in 56, 7% of all cases, most of these in cases with strong diabetes mellitus. The greater number of lesions were insertion anomalies of the cord. All placentas-showed disturbed circulation by dominance of disturbed blood supply. A relation to the degree of the severity of the disease wasn't provable. Very often we found villi necrosis and proliferations of the syncytiotrophoblast. Also we could see alterations of the villi vessels and a compensatory angiomatosis. 83,3% of diabetes cases showed disturbed maturation of the villi; the grade of these changes could not be referred to the degree of severity of this disease; it was merely a ramification block. The authors point out that in diabetes mellitus the degree of danger to the pregnancy does not depend on the severity of the maternal disease. It is always necessary to have a sufficient metabolic condition.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":1212541,"Title":"Diabetes mellitus: a challenge for the countries of the region.","Journal":"Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>PAHO recently convened a meeting of experts on diabetes mellitus for purposes of underlining the importance of the disease as a health problem and developing recommendations to assist the countries of the Region in establishing control programs. Existing data on the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in different countries are not comparable, since population samples are not always representative and diagnostic criteria vary. Ten different countries set the prevalence figure at anywhere from 1.2 to 6.9 per cent. Mortality from diabetes reveals only part of the problem, largely because of registration difficulties. The figures that are available, however, show that the situation is very serious in several Carribbean countries; that is, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica rank first, second, and third, respectively, among 22 countries in the Americas. The data now available on morbidity and mortality, expected population growth, and probably increases in the relative size of older population groups lead to the assumption that diabetes mellitus, together with its complications, will become an increasingly serious problem in the Region over the next 10 to 15 years. Programs for the control of diabetes mellitus should include educational campaigns for patients, the public, and health professionals; early detection of the disease in high-risk groups; registration and followup of cases and the organization of systems for providing comprehensive care. Promotion of basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research directed at local problems and seeking to acquire a better understanding of the nature of the disease and its complications is also highly recommended. Naturally, each country should adapt current methods of treatment to local socioeconomic and cultural circumstances, especially with regard to dietary therapy, prescribed insulin dosage, and use of the controversial oral hypoglycemic drugs. Despite the important contribution that research can make to a better understanding of diabetes mellitus, it is the health authorities, the patients, and the public who still have the major task of coping with this increasingly prevalent disease, which more and more is revealing the consequences of its chronic  nature and complications in our Region.</AbstractText>"}

The authors propose to use this method for the study of the process of demyelinization in the brain stem and for early diagnosis of disseminated sclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

Some form of predisposing factor was present in nearly all cases. There was a remarkably high incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease among the parents of the stroke victims. Only 50% of the patients with hypertension known prior to the stroke had received adequate treatment. There were six females on oral contraceptives. The immediate mortality, i.e. within one month, was 35% essentially caused by a very high initial mortality among patients with cerebral haemorrhage. The patients were checked after 30 months. At this time, 16 patients were still alive and 11 able to perform some sort of work. Among the survivors there was a high incidence of diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism, to judge from intravenous glucose tolerance tests. The chances of survival and vocational rehabilitation seem to be fairly good, compared with higher age groups, thus urgently calling upon the resources of the community for active therapeutic measures and training. Individuals with hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, with heredity for vascular disease and diabetes seem to be especially at risk for early stroke. Health surveys should be directed to tracing these subjects early.</AbstractText>"}

Most of these patients had intestinal or biliary fistulas or abscesses and were seriously ill. Major  contributing factors to the development of candidal infections included the extensive use of multiple antibiotics, multiple operations, advanced age, and debility. Thirty additional patients had cultures positive for candida from skin and subcutaneous isolates. Candida appeared to contribute to the poor healing of wounds in some of these patients, particularly those with peripheral vascular ischemic lesions and decubitus ulcers. Antibiotics and concurrent diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, renal failure, and cardiovascular disease, were common factors relating to the development and growth of candida in these patients. There is often considerable difficulty in determing whether or not candida is only a contaminant or is an infectious agent contributing to the illness of the patient. This must be determined in each individual instance. In spite of the fact that candida appeared to be a significant infectious agent in many of these patients, specific antifungal therapy was used sparsely. It is suggested that appropriate antifungal drugs be used in patients with significant disease and that there should be greater awareness of the factors leading to the development of these extremely serious candidal infections.</AbstractText>"}

Over four years, 36 patients started PD with the intention of carrying out home treatments. Thirty of the 36 succeeded and 22 completed at least six months of home treatments, seven have so far been treated for over one year. No neuropathy developed except in diabetic patients. No patient, including four who had undergone bilateral nephrectomy, was depenedent on blood transfusions. Predialysis serum creatinine values were questionably higher (p less than 0.07) in a group of six patients who at another time had been maintained on hemodialysis (HD). In this group serum albumin was (mean +/- 1 S.D.) 3.3 +/- 4 g/100 ml on PD and 3.8 g/100 ml on HD (p less than 0.05). Sixteen of the 36 patients had bacterial peritonitis on 22 occasions; the average incidence was once every 14 months of patient exposure. An epidemic of sterile peritonitis involving 40 episodes in 16 patients was resolved after machine techniques were changed. Catheter failure occurred in 15 of the 22 patients in the long-term group, but catheter replacement was not difficult.</AbstractText>"}

The exact nature of the lesion and its etiology remain unknown. Morphologically there appear to be two courses this disease may follow. There is a benign course, which occurred in 89 per cent of our series of adult diabetic patients, consisting of concurrent thickening of the capillary basement membranes and diffuse glomerulosclerosis. The benign course is slowly progressive over many years, and rarely leads to renal failure. The accelerated course, in our experience is always superimposed on the changes of the benign course, and consists of a more rapid progression with the development of glomerulocapillary microaneurysms. Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, exudative-deposit lesions, and glomerulocapsular adhesions leading to glomerular obliteration and renal failure. Data are presented to support the concept that large Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules are formed by the organization of the glomerulocapillary microaneurysms.</AbstractText>"}

Plasma IRI was significantly reduced in a streptozotocin treated diabetic rat 8 weeks after streptozotocin injection. In normal rats oral administration of Sodium tolbutamide (TOL) and Glybenclamide (GLI) produced a significant fall in BS and a concurrent increase in plasma IRI, but phenformin (PHE) was without any effect on both these parameters. Unlike normal rats streptozotocin treated diabetic rats did not show lowering of BS and increase in plasma IRI following TOL and GLI. PHE, however, did produce a significant fall in BS. Oral glucose load did show a typical glucose tolerance curve and insulin release in normal rats. However, in the diabetic rats there was no significant increase in plasma IRI following glucose load. It is therefore concluded that streptozotocin treated diabetic rats differ from the maturity onset diabetic as regards the responses of TOL and GLI are concerned and this animal model can therefore be useful in differentiating the two types of oral hypoglycemic agents.</AbstractText>"}

Journal canadien d'ophtalmologie","Date":"Jul 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>We examined 9 cataracts from maturity onset diabetics and 4 senile posterior subcapsular cataracts by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence for crystallin proteins and actin, histochemical methods and x-ray diffraction. The cataractous regions contained spherical globules up to 20 mu in diameter, often in a fibrous matrix. Some were extracellular Morgagnian globules, apparently formed by blebbing from the cell surface; others appeared to have been formed intracellularly. The area of globular degeneration was usually 300 mu deep, but had deeper fusiform extensions. Morphological changes in the cell cytoplasm varied according to their depth in the cataract. Electron microscopy showed intracellular and extracellular globules, many of them were bounded by lipid bilayer membranes. Immunofluorescent staining showed that all the globules contained gamma-crystallin; some contained alpha- and beta-crystallins and actin. All the globules contained higher concentrations of cysteine or cystine than the surrounding lens tissue but they did not react to stains for carbohydrate or calcium. X-ray diffraction studies showed that crystalline calcium salts were absent. Globules and cavities averaged 45% of the total area in cross section. Assuming an area of cataract to be 300 micron thick and that globules 1 mu in diameter scattered, while 2--20 mu in diameter reflected light, we calculated that light passing through such a thickness would be reduced by 65%. Thus the globules could account for most of the opacity of the cataractous area. Presumably the fibrous degeneration of the cells causes enough light scattering to account for the remainder of the reduction. Cataract patients complain of decreased visual acuity, a golden halo around objects, and difficulties when driving while facing oncoming traffic at night. These probably result from light scattering. In our previous experiments, globular bodies containing gamma-crystallin were found in cells grown in tissue culture, and blebs with increased acitn content similar to Morgagnian globules were formed in tissue culture by treating differentiated rat lens cells of stage 2 by cytochalasin D (which impaired microfilament function). These results suggest the possibility of simulating in tissue culture the morphological alterations seen in the cataractous cell.</AbstractText>"}

Prevalence was lower than in our urban Zulu study. Blood pressure rose with age, but there was a greater rise in systolic than in diastolic blood pressure. Prevalence in males and females under 40 years were equal. There was an association between hypertension and diabetes mellitus. More effective screening and therapeutic programmes should be initiated in the Indian population because of the high prevalence of hypertension which may lead to complications if untreated, and because 58% of the hypertensive subjects were untreated or had discontinued therapy.</AbstractText>"}

Acromegalic patients with arterial hypertension (AH) show a twice higher incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiomegaly with obvious or latent cardiac failure, arrhythmias, which frequently lead to death. The uncertain pathogeny of cardiomyopathy implied: hypoxia due to heart hypertrophy (over 500 g and increased cross-section of the fibre to over 26/mu), adrenergic deficiency resulting from increased protein synthesis and decrease in thyrosine, a precursor of myocardic cathecolamines. The increased incidence of coronary pathology is favoured in acromegalic patients by diabetes, hyperlipoproteinemia, low endogenous heparin, increased ureic acid and platelet adhesivity. Hypophysectomy by hypophysolysis (20 cases) brings relief and cures cardiovascular pathology, reduces AH, corrects the coronary risk factors, cures hypophyseal diabetes. The existence of AH and cardiovascular pathology is an indication for surgical treatment in evolutive acromegaly.</AbstractText>"}

Furthermore the patients with carcinoma of the uterine corpus had an earlier menarche, a later menopause, a smaller number of deliveries and more menstrual abnormalities.

Hyperplastic alterations are established most frequently in the presence of diabetic nephropathia and azotemia. They could be explained with the development of a secondary hyperparathyroidism, associated with chronic renal insufficiency. In single cases, an effect of the disturbance of the calcium-phosphorus metabolism in diabetes is admitted. Changes in the parathyroid glands, from the type of generalized diabetic microangiopathy, is suspected in one of the deceased patients. Two microadenomas were found in another case, predominantly with dark basic cells. No dependence was established between the morphological alterations and the severity, diabetes form, nor with the presence of pyelonephritis. Certain dependence was established between the age of the deceased and the stage of the azotemia.</AbstractText>"}

Pathological responses were characterized by reduced amplitude, desynchronization and decreased conduction velocity (CV). Four groups of patients with increasingly severe nerve dysfunction were distinguished. The presence and severity of clinical neuropathy in the upper limbs could be related to decreased maximal sensory nerve CV in the proximal segment of the limbs. When maximal sensory nerve CV was normal above the wrist, neuropathy usually remained latent. In severe cases where no sensory nerve potentials could be recorded, the cerebral evoked potentials nonetheless permitted a precise evaluation of the somatosensory conduction. In these cases, maximal sensory nerve CV was very low. In five patients with a so-called diabetic mononeuropathy, abnormal nerve potentials were recorded in the median nerve, although no clinical signs could be seen in the corresponding territory. It is proposed that the diabetic nature of a mononeuropathy can be assessed by the finding of latent abnormalities in seemingly normal nerve.</AbstractText>"}

The incidence of diabetes among the different groups of relatives is expressed as the risk of developing the disease at specified ages. It is concluded that the risk of siblings or children of early-onset diabetics developing the same disease is about ten times that of a normal population chosen for comparison, whereas the risk of siblings developing diabetes later in life does not differ from this normal population. On the basis of the data presented here, combined with reanalyses of previously published data from other authors, it is concluded that early onset and late onset diabetes cannot have an identical genetic background.</AbstractText>"}

A retrospective review of consecutive angiographic procedures performed over a six month interval revealed a 12 per cent incidence of renal failure following angiography. The degree of failure was severe in approximately 30 per cent of these cases and was associated with a significant mortality even though renal function usually recovered. The occurrence of renal failure was associated with the presence of renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, diabetes mellitus, hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria at the time of angiography to a statistically significant level. Furthermore, combinations of these factors, particularly preexisting combined renal insufficiency and impaired liver function, were associated with an increased incidence of acute renal failure. It is concluded that angiography poses a significant hazard to patients with underlying medical problems, particularly those involving the excretory routes of the contrast agent.</AbstractText>"}

Intravenous nitroprusside reduces left ventricular filling pressure and increases cardiac output while modestly reducing blood pressure and not changing heart rate in patients with heart failure in whom this response is characteristic. Comparably reduced blood pressure during nitroprusside infusion in normal subjects or hypertensive patients without failure results in a decrease in cardiac output and tachycardia. Long-acting vasodilators are also effective in patients with congestive heart failure. Nitrates, predominant venodilators, decrease left ventricular filling pressure as much as nitroprusside does, but increase cardiac output less. Hydralazine, an arterial dilator, increases cardiac output similarly to nitroprusside but decreases filling pressure less. Combining hydralazine with nitrates results in hemodynamic effects almost identical to those of nitroprusside. The quinazoline derivatives, trimazosin and prazosin, are also effective vasodilators, which act on both arteries and veins in patients with congestive heart failure. The hemodynamic response to vasodilators is influenced by the underlying hemodynamic status, as the change in cardiac output is directly related to base line ventricular filling pressure as well as systemic vascular resistance, and inversely related to the base line cardiac output. Response to vasodilators does not appear to be altered by age, diabetes, acute myocardial infarction or the cause of congestive myocardiopathy.</AbstractText>"}

Smoking pattern and blood pressure status were established in 1951 and job activity was assessed annually during the followup period. Lower levels of energy expenditure predicted increased risk of fatal heart attack and perhaps of stroke. Heavy cigarette smoking predicted increased risk of death from heart attack, cancer, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure were associated with death from all cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis. Tacit to these findings: sedentary living takes its toll largely through heart disease and stroke; the toxicity of cigarette smoking is associated with a broader range of diseases, including heart attack, cancer, and respiratory disease; and higher level of blood pressure related to an even broader range of cardiovascular disease than either of the other characteristics studied.</AbstractText>"}

Gestational maturity was assessed by ultrasonic measurement of the fetal biparietal diameter and by analysing constituents of amniotic fluid (creatinine, bilirubin, fat cells) while pulmonary maturity was assessed from the L/S ratio in the amniotic fluid. Each individual method has a wide margin of error, however, ultrasound cephalometry gave the best prediction for determination of fetal age. In 135 selected cases lung maturity was assessed by using two techniques, a thin layer chromatographic determination of the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio in the amniotic fluid and a rapid semiquantitative test to determine the titre of surfactant which generates stable foam in presence of ethanol. The results obtained by the two methods correlated well and were reliable in predicting the respiratory distress syndrome. It appears that these methods make it possible to obtain greater margins of reliability. The role of fetal and maternal factors in the maturation of fetal lungs was also studied in several pathological conditions and it was noted that in many cases of maternal diabetes mellitus lung maturity was reached at a later age than in normal pregnancies. It is condluded that if termination of pregnancy is indicated, the physician should rely more on the assessment of lung maturity than on indicators of gestational age.</AbstractText>"}

The capillaries in the group of patients with nephritis were found to undergo two main changes: thickening of the adventitia reticularis and perivascular cellular infiltration in an inverse ratio. This infiltration was seen to be made up of mononuclear cells and an increased number of mast cells in various stages of degranulation. Changes in the basement membrane as seen by electron microscopy are not constant. All of the above changes were absent in the controls and are similar to what has been described in previous studies in both experimental and spontaneous pathologic conditions, such as experimental hypertension, diabetes mellitus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Small vessel involvement in chronic nephritides could be part of a process of diffuse microvascular damage that includes the kidneys or it may be related to hypertension or to the biochemical changes which follow uremic and pre-uremic states.</AbstractText>"}

Combined hyperlipidemia was slightly more common (21%) than isolated increase of either cholesterol (17.9%) or triglycerides (12.6%). Using other cut-off limits for the definition of hyperlipidemia, a striking change in the distribution between these three types of hyperlipidemia occurred. In our patients, the frequencies of different blood groups were not significantly different from those of a comparable population.

Erythema was found to be more intense in young than in old controls after 1 and 7 days. The late erythematous reaction was more pronounced in short-term diabetic animals than in controls of the same age, indicating that the diabetic metabolic derangement per se alters the reaction. In addition, long-term diabetic rats had a markedly increased skin redness after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days when compared with controls of the same age. Thus, long-term diabetes enhances the erythematous reaction. As to the extent of necrosis, there was no significant differences between the experimental groups. There was, however, a tendency for an increased amount in the long-term when compared with the short-term diabetic rats.</AbstractText>"}

The ratio of the maximal amplitudes of the H/M potentials studied usually decreased in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with analogous indices in healthy persons. However, in the presence of labile or ketoacidotic forms of diabetes H/M increased considerably. Accelerated restoration of the H-reflex amplitude in coupled stimulations of the nerve in such patients indicated intensification of the facilitating cerebrospinal influences. A marked increase of the tendon and H-reflexes amplitude in patients with diabetes against the background of Jendrassik's method pointed to a possible deafferentation of the spinal centres. The results obtained indicated that, irrespective of the manifestations of the neuropathy symptoms, there were functional disturbances of both the segmental and suprasegmental formations controlling the motor function.</AbstractText>"}

The number of motor neurons taking part in the reflex proved to be less in diabetic animals; rhythmic H-reflex was depressed. These disturbances were primarily connected with the functional changes of the primary afferent terminals of the segmental spinal cord level. In animals with moderately severe diabetes the operative mediator fraction was readily exhausted and the mediator emission decreased. Besides, animals with a severe form of alloxan diabetes displayed postsynaptic disturbances. A positive correlation between the extent of the H-reflex depression and the severity (duration) of alloxan diabetes was demonstrated.</AbstractText>"}

Its changes were two-stage in character and depended on the state of the venous outflow. Diabetic retinopathy of the II stage served as the stage during which there was a sharp reduction of compensatory possibilities of hemodynamics, and further progress of vascular disturbances were observed. Rheoophthalmography permits to assess indirectly the degree of compensation of hemodynamic disturbances and can be used to asses clinical evolution of diabetic retinopathy.</AbstractText>"}

There were no maternal deaths, and ther perinatal mortality rate was 0.49%. The second stage of labor was prolonged in 9.7% of primigravidas and in 2.2% of multiparas. Shoulder dystocia and perineal lacerations were related to increasing birthweight. Difficult deliveries resulting in clavicle fracture or brachial plexus injuries, and facial trauma contributed to the 11.4% perinatal morbidity rate. Asphyxia was observed in 7.7% and hypoglycemia in 5.2% of the neonates. Congenital anomalies (1.5%) were not increased in the large fetus group. Close surveillance for diabetes mellitus and anticipation of the potential complications associated with delivery of a large infant may reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity rates and maintain low mortality rates.</AbstractText>"}

Because of reports that treatment of the mother before delivery with estrogens or glucocorticoids results in a decreased incidence of RDS in newborns the relationship between endogenous estradiol and cortisol levels in cord plasm was investigated. There was no significant correlation between the concentrations of these steroids in 65 specimens; the cortisol levels associated with two cases of severe RDS were low.</AbstractText>"}

There is also evidence that some infants of individuals with low insulin response might have a carbohydrate metabolism that is in some respects similar to that of newborn infants to diabetic mothers (Edström et al. 1974). In the present study 15 infants to low insulin responders (ILR) and 22 infants to high insulin responders (IHR) were subjected to an intravenous glucose load (IVGTT) at 2-24 h age. A significant difference in glucose tolerance was found between the groups, the mean k-value for the ILR being 1.39 plus or minus 0.41 and that for the IHR 1.05 plus or minus 0.09 (P smaller than 0.05). No mothers were found to have a gestational diabetes (with the possible exception of one low insulin responders) but during late pregnancy the mean k-value at IVGTT in the low responders decreased from non-pregnant values (the mean difference being 0.41 plus or minus 0.20, P smaller 0.025) while the high responders did not show a corresponding decrease (mean difference 0.12 plus or minus 0.25, P greater than 0.05). No other differences between the groups of infants that could influence the k-value could be found apart from the mothers being low or high insulin responders. Our findings show that a low insulin response in the mothers might effect the glucose tolerance of the foetus even in the absence of continuous maternal hyperglycaemia in late pregnancy.</AbstractText>"}

The blood was first subjected to rapid viscometric flow (460 sec-1, all RBC dispersed and aligned in flow) and then brought abruptly to full stop. In normal human blood, primary and secondary RCA occurred simultaneously, and were completed within 8 to 10 sec after stop. Blood from pregnant women at term, known for its pronounced red cell aggregation, shows a dissociation between the formation of short primary rouleaux (initiated even before full stop and completed 1-2 see thereafter) and secondary RCA completed 3-5 see after stop. RCA increases the light transmission of blood (measured by an increase in photovoltage V), the process and its first derivative (dV/dt equals I) can be recorded. After flow stop, there is an exponential decay of I(I equals t-I-o with e-lambda-t). The half time of this decay is recorded and correlated to the kinetics of red cell aggregate formation In human blood the half time of this process varies between 1.0 and 6.0 sec. In suspensions of human RBC in artificial plasmas, t-1/2 decreases with increasing concentration of fibrinogen and/or Dextran 250000, the second component appearing at concentrations above 500 mg-%.

Two had died, one in the postoperative period and one 10 years post-operatively. The remaining nine were traced and eight of them were personally interviewed and tested. All nine were well and free from recurrent symptoms. Five of the eight had evidence of subnormal insulin production in response to oral glucose. Glucose tolerance was impaired in three. Minor anomalies were found in the electroencephalograms of all these patients and major abnormalities in two.The results of this survey suggest that other patients who have had islet cell tumours removed may now have unsuspected diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

A fiber-optic light pipe surrounds the probe tip used for deep vitrectomy in conjunction with an irrigated fundus lens. A film will illustrate the use of the roto-extractor in two diabetic patients with old unabsorbed vitreous hemorrhage and membranes. In the first case, a pars plana incision was used for vitrectomy in conjunction with a cataract extraction. In the second case, the para plana vitrectomy was combined with an optical iridectomy necessitated by the presence of an updrawn pupil following previous cataract extraction complicated by vitreous loss.

The patients were allotted to three groups according to the severity and extent of the inflammatory involvement at operation. The diagnostic findings obtained at the preoperative evaluation correlated well to these groupings. In some patients, however, the inflammatory process was mainly confined to the ductal system, as revealed by pancreatography, while in others the changes were most marked in the parenchyma, as found at histologic examination. 21 caudal pancreatico-jejunostomies and 8 longitudinal anastomoses were performed. Overall results were excellent in 20 patients, good in 6, fair in 3, and poor in none. The rate of postoperative complications was low; no mortality, one spontaneously healed anastomosis insufficiency, subphrenic abscess developed in 2 instances and postoperative diabetes in 5. Only one patient had a recurrent attack of acute pancreatitis postoperatively. Re-anastomosis was successfully performed.</AbstractText>"}

Three quarters of these had been referred directly to the endocrine clinic at the Middlesex Hospital. The remainder were referred from the Royal Post-graduate Hospital because they were thought unsuitable for yttrium implantation. The patients were studied by clinical assessment of severity, by measurement of basal growth hormone levels on three separate mornings, and by a review of possible complications. Particular attention was paid to diabetes, hypertension, cardiomegaly, respiratory, vascular and skeletal changes as well as visual field defect. Aggressive treatment was recommended in 77 patients. It was not recommended in the remainder on account of age, intercurrent illness or the apparent mildness of the condition. Fifty-nine patients were treated by trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. In 46 of the 59 patients the mean basal growth hormone level has been reduced to 5 ng/ml or less. In 39 this followed operation, in five operation and subsequent X-ray therapy and in two operation and the continuing effect of previously implanted yttrium. Of these 46 patients in whom the growth hormone level has been reduced to normal, 26 do not show any deficiency of anterior pituitary trophic hormones, 13 have gonadotrophin defect (in eight of these it was present before the operation) and seven require full replacement therapy. One patient died at home six weeks after the operation from a pulmonary embolus. There was one case of CSF rhinorrhoea which stopped spontaneously and three of acute frontal sinusitis. Trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy is shown to be an effective means of treating acromegaly. If the basal level of growth hormone is not reduced to normal by six weeks after operation, it is recommended that a course of X-ray therapy should be given. This does not apply if irradiation has been used before operation.</AbstractText>"}

In florid diabetes, classical symptoms of diabetes and high glucose in blood and urine make the diagnosis easy. For asymptomatic diabetes; if confirmed fasting blood glucose measures over 125 mg per 100 ml, the diagnosis is accepted. When the fasting blood glucose measures under 125 mg per 100 ml, I recommend an oral glucose tolerance test and apply suitable criteria for interpretation. The United States Public Health Service criteria represent a reasonable, moderate approach when one modifies the interpretation by cognizance of environmental factors in the patient and by identifying interfering influences as drugs, physical inactivity, fever or starvation. Indeed, one should postpone a glucose tolerance test until these interfering factors abate. Management of the patient with an abnormal glucose tolerance test includes sharing the prognostic dilemma with the patient regarding the likelihood of deterioration in glucose tolerance to florid diabetes. In this situation the term, abnormal glucose tolerance test, is preferred over chemical diabetes. The physician and the patient must develop some degree of comfort with a clinical state that often remains nebulous. Though the writings of authorities occasionally sound dogmatic, rigid, and conflicting, they reflect a viewpoint which opines that no clear answers are available; that the clinician and his patient must accept this posture; and that together they must develop the best therapeutic program for the individual in question.</AbstractText>"}

The basal serum hormone levels revealed the following findings: Serum testosterone was markedly lower in diabetics than in normals ( 177 +/- 24 resp. 618 +/- 52 ng/dl). This is in contrast to other studies, but it may reflect decreased testicular function due to an early, clinically not apparent atherosclerotic disease. Serum T3 was significantly lower in diabetics than in normals (110 +/- 16 resp. 145 +/- 19), suggesting an early 'low T3-syndrome' in juvenile-type diabetics. However, increased serum rT3 levels were not observed, and serum T4 and TSH were normal. Mild prolonged exercise had no major effects on these nonglucoregulatory hormones. In juvenile-type diabetics the degree of metabolic control had no influence on the response of the mentioned hormones. However, an increased cortisol/testosterone ratio in ketotic diabetics in the basal state with a further increase during exercise was demonstrated, indicating an aggravation of the catabolic state in these patients during exercise.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, a glucose production from the working muscle took place in about 40 percent of both the diabetic patients and the starved obese subjects. The nonutilization of glucose during physical work in the diabetic like states was accompanied by a significantly diminished lactate output. The arterial concentration of FFA, glycerol beta-HOB and Acac was markedly elevated in the starved obese patients. The FFA-uptake at rest and during exercise, however, was not different from results of controls. Whereas an effux of beta-HOB has been observed during exercise, Acac uptake was increased in these patients.

The diuresis did not change in ADH-resistant diabetes insipidus patients. The investigations suggest that carbamazepine exerts an ADH-like effect, and can be applied with good results in the treatment of ADH-sensitive diabetes insipidus.</AbstractText>"}

In two cases the P wave abnormalities were intermittent. In agreement with the results of Castillo and Vernant right atrial activation appears to be normal and coincides with the initial positive deflection of the P wave in leads II, III, and aVF. Left atrial activation starts at the end of the right atrial activation, coinciding with the terminal negative deflection of the P wave in leads II, III,  and aVF and shows an abnormal progression from the lower part to the upper part of the atrium. This pattern of atrial depolarisation can only be explained by a block of the superior interatrial pathways. On the basis of the present findings it is supposed that the block occurs in a specialized type of atrial tissue rather than in the common atrial myocardium. From the  clinical point of view it is of some interest to point out that this abnormal pattern of atrial depolarisation does not necessarily prolong the atrial deloparisation and may not determine a terminal negative deflection of the P wave in lead II.</AbstractText>"}

Patients were allocated to either drug at random and recived either 2 capsules (100 mg. elemental iron) or 1 tablet (105 mg. elemental iron) daily for 30 days. Haemoglobin levels and packed cell volume were measured before and at the end of the trial period. The results, analysed in 57 patients (28 on 'Eryfer' and 29 on the slow-release iron) indicate that treatment with 'Eryfer' produced a significantly more predictable response in haemoglobin regeneration, the response being dependent on the initial haemoglobin level. Both treatments, however, produced a highly significant increase in haemoglobin levels in the patients (mean increas: 'Eryfer' 1.09 g. and slow-release iron 0.76 g.).

{"PMID":1143049,"Title":"The role of insulin and glucagon in regulating glucose turnover in dogs during exercise.","Journal":"Medicine and science in sports","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>During exercise the flux of glucose is regulated so that the increased demand of glucose by the muscle is met by a corresponding increased release of glucose by the liver; plasma glucose concentration does not change markedly, while glucose turnover increases. These precise regulatory mechanisms can be studied by quantitative isotope dilution methods; measurements of plasma glucose concentrations do not necessarily reflect any changes in glucose fluxes. Insulin is considered to be an important regulatory hormone during exercise. Its concentration decreases during exercise in part because of a decrease in insulin secretion by the pancreas and in part because the removal of insulin is increased. This conclusion was reached because insulin concentration in plasma decreased both in normal and in depancreatized insulin-infused dogs. A sudden decrease of portal insulin concentration facilitates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. At the same time blood flow decreases in those areas which are inactive during exercise such as the splanchnic beds, while increased blood flow and opening of the capillary beds increases the total amount of insulin perfusing the muscle. Therefore, even in presence of low insulin concentration in plasma the insulin supply to the working muscle can presumably be maintained at an adequate level. We considered that exercise changes the distribution of insulin in relation to the liver and the muscle; such a distribution pattern may represent an important physiological regulatory mechanism. The question whether glucagon is essential in regulating glucose production during exercise could not be resolved because depancreatized insulin-infused dogs had essentially normal plasma concentrations of immunoreactive glucagon. Glucagon concentration increases during strenuous but not during moderate exercise of normal dogs. This increase is apparently not indispensable because during strenuous exercise depancreatized insulin-infused dogs did not increase IRG</AbstractText>"}

However, in most respects, coronary artery disease in young women does not appear to differ from coronary disease in other patients.</AbstractText>"}

In addition, the insulin requirements were recorded. Weight and height proved to be within the normal range, and height at onset of diabetes was normal. After a long duration of diabetes, however, there occurred a reduction of height increment of obout 1/2cm/year. This reduction was greater in children who rarely attended as compared with those who frequently attended a sub-specialized clinic. The daily dose of insulin increased with age, the greatest increase coinciding with the growth spurt. During the first 4 years of diabetes the 24-hour dose/kg body weight increased, indicating a decreasing endogenous insulin production. Later it was constant at around 0.9 i.u./kg. Modern management of diabetic children leads to normal adult stature.</AbstractText>"}

The infusion of 10% mannitol in 0.9% saline avoided the hypertonic saline overload and the fluid restriction period, both badly tolerated by infants and small children. In a control group of children aged from two months to seven years, the values of T(H2O) plotted against C(OSM) allowed to calculate the adjustment curve y=0.80x0.75, r=0.98 (p is less than 0.0001). In six patients with pituitary diabetes insipidus (PDI), the test was used in order to quantify the degree of ADH deficiency and evaluate the carbamazepine and clofibrate effect, in the renal concentrating mechanism. The test was tolerated perfectly in every case, obtaining qualitative and quantitative data and avoiding the hyponatremia and hypokalemia produced by the mannitol.</AbstractText>"}

This study tested for the first time in man the hypothesis that the mode of action of endogenous insulin differs from peripherally injected insulin. In 11 nondiabetic and six diabetic patients we compared the effects on peripheral glucose utilization (PGU) and degree of hypoglycemia of the following: (1) glucagon-free insulin rapidly injected and slowly infused into the portal circulation via percutaneous splenic puncture; (2) peripheral intravenous inslin; (3) peripheral intravenous sodium tolbutamide. The arteriovenous glucose difference (A-V) and (A-V)/A ratios were calculated as parameters for measuring PGU. In nondiabetics our experiments showed: (1) similar magnitudes of hypoglycemia for insulin given by both routes, and (2) a significantly smaller (A-V)/A and therefore PGU, after the intraportal route, particularly after a slow infusion. Intravenous tolbutamide produced marked hypoglycemia and a small PGU comparable to that of slow intraportal infusion of insulin. In diabetics, results were similar. These findings suggest that, compared to the action of peripherally administered insulin, intraportally injected exogenous insulin or tolbutamide-induced endogenous insulin has a greater hepatic and a lesser peripheral effect on glucose metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

A critical review of the literature is also presented. The permanence of diabetes is demonstrated by the duration of insulin therapy still necessary after 30 months. Insulin-stimulation tests have been performed some for the first time in such a young diabetic. They have shown a nearly total failure in beta-cell response, only very high doses of glucagon provoking a moderate insulin secretion. The absence of acetonuria is discussed. It can perhaps be explained by the hyperglycemia which, by a mass effect, brings about cellular glucose penetration and this stops liberation of Nefa's from adipose tissue.</AbstractText>"}

Retinopathy was present in all patients and nephropathy in four. Plasma albumin concentration and plasma volume were reduced (P smaller than 0.05). The previously reported decrease in the intravascular albumin mass in long-term diabetics was thus confirmed by an average of 59.0 g/m2 surface area, compared with a normal value of 71.7 g/m2-(minus18%) (P smaller than 0.005). The albumin metabolic rate was increased, the fractional disappearance rate being an average 13.2% of the intravascular albumin mass per 24 hr, compared with a normal value of 8.4% (+ 57%) (P smaller 0.001). The rate of synthesis was 7.7 g - 24 h-1 - m-2 in contrast to a normal rate of 6.2 g - 24 h-1 - m-2 (+24%) (P smaller 0.001). Total body albumin mass was decreased proportionally to the intravascular mass. Confirming previous observations, we found an increase in the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (fraction of intravascular albumin mass passing to the extravascular space per unit time) from a normal average of 5.6% - hr-1 to 7.4% - hr-1 (+32%) (P ssmaller than 0.001). This finding can best be explained by an increased microvascular permeability to plasma proteins. A positive correlation between the transcapillary escape rate and fractional disappearance rate of albumin was demonstrated ( r equals 0.74; P smaller than 0.01). This supports the concept that albumin is catabolized in connection with its permeation through the microvascular endothelium.</AbstractText>"}

Clinically patients behaviour was changed and with electroencephalgraphy an encephalopathy was found in 7 cases. 4. Electroencephalograms were in more than 50% of cases slightly abnormal. 5. A myastenic reaction, confirmed by electromyography, occurred in one case (but not in its sibling who had also a pigmentary retinopathy.) 6. In 14 cases electromyogram was showing a neurogenic damage. Motor nerve conduction speed was lowered in 2 cases, in 5 cases it was at the lower limit of normal. In 6 cases very long distal latence times were noted. In 2 cases action potential was shortened but this could not be considered as  a myopathy for certain. 7. In 6 cases a hyperlipoproteinaemia occurred.  In 2 cases a mild diabetes mellitus, in 7 cases uric acid level in serum was raised. The number of cases was too small to give a statistical importance to those findings. 8. Cerebrospinal fluid was found normal in all cases. 9. This study should lead to further investigations.

Major findings included common failure to define the consultation purpose or document adequately follow-up visits, incomplete professional adherence to published guidelines for perioperative diabetic management, and correlation between failure to document the consultant's own physical examination and failure to reach new conclusions.

Only a small fraction of the county-to-county variation in mortality was explained by these variables, in contrast to their strong correlation with other common neoplasms. The only geographic cluster occurred in an area encompassing parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. Throughout the country, however, the rates for pancreas cancer were higher in urban areas, especially in males, and in counties with many residents of Scandinavian and East European (particularly Russian) descent. No associations were found with socioeconomic, industrial, or alcohol-consumption indices. The mortality patterns for pancreas and lung cancers were highly correlated in males, suggesting the influence of tobacco consumption on both tumors. In females, pancreas cancer was significantly correlated with diabetes mellitus, consistent with other evidence linking these two diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Although the biopsy specimens showed only early to moderate diffuse glomerulosclerosis without either nodular or exudative lesions, approximately 70% of glomeruli examined showed specific fluorescence for fibrinogen in a discontinuous linear pattern along the capillary basement membrane and diffusely in the mesangium. Moreover the immunofluorescence findings correlated well with the distribution patterns of material thought to be fibrin both in the light microscopy studies, by virtue of its staining properties, and by electron microscopy, because of periodicity, texture, and electron density. It is suggested that electron-dense granular deposits seen on electron microscopy may represent intermediate compounds in the fibrinogen to fibrin conversion, and that endothelial and mesangial trapping of fibrinogen or other macromolecules may initiate or accelerate mesangial enlargement, nodule formation, and irregularity of the basement membrane.</AbstractText>"}

In most cases acute pancreatitis is associated with alcoholism or biliary tract disease. Elevated serum or urinary alpha-amylase is the most important finding in diagnosis. The presence of methemalbumin in serum and in peritoneal or pleural fluid supports the diagnosis of the hemorrhagic form of the disease in patients with a history and enzyme studies suggestive of pancreatitis. There is no characteristic clinical picture in acute pancreatitis, and its complications are legion. Pancreatic pseudocyst is probably the most common and pancreatic abscess is the most serious complication. The pathogenetic principle is autodigestion, but the precise sequence of biochemical events is unclear, especially the mode of trypsinogen activation and the role of lysosomal hydrolases. A host of metabolic derangements have been identified in acute pancreatitis, involving lipid, glucose, calcium and magnesium metabolism and changes of the blood clotting mechanism, to name but a few. Medical treatment includes intestinal decompression, analgesics, correction of hypovolemia and other supportive and protective measures. Surgical exploration is advisable in selected cases, when the diagnosis is in doubt, and is considered imperative in the presence of certain complications, especially pancreatic abscess.</AbstractText>"}

The following determination were made: spontaneous fibrinolytic activity of the blood; fibrinolytic response to standardized venous stasis (stimulated fibrinolytic activity, 'fibrinolytic capacity'); histochemical determination of fibrinolytic activators in the walls of superficial veins collected by biopsy. Diabetic patients were found as a group to have an impaired fibrinolytic system with the above fibrinolytic parameters decreased to various degrees in comparison with those of the controls. Less clear differences were observed between patients with and without ophthalmoscopically visible diabetic changes of the retina. However, patients with beginning angiopathy were found to have a significantly higher amount of fibrinolytic activators in their vessel walls than patients with more advanced retinopathy and without ophthalmoscopically detectable retinopathy. Furthermore, unlike patients without retinopathy, patients with retinopathy increased less or did not increase at all their spontaneous and stimulated fibrinolytic activity along the duration of the disease. The defective fibrinolytic system of diabetic patients may contribute to the occurrence of the vascular complications frequently seen in this disease. In the diabetic group, those patients who develop retinopathy show an impaired fibrinolytic defense with the duration of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Nine rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus were studied using standard micropuncture and clearance techniques. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from inulin clearance, urine and plasma osmolality (U/Posm) and urine flow rate (V) were determined in eight of nine animals. During either sustained diuresis (five animals) or vasopressin-induced antidiuresis (four animals), individual surface convolutions of distal convoluted tubules or early cortical collecting ducts were preserved for ultrastructural examination by intraluminal microperfusion with a glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde fixative followed by a second microperfusion with a lanthanum tracer. Mean GFR during diuresis was 6.31 plus or minus se 0.63 ml/min/kg of body wt and v=797 plus or minus se 108 mul/min/kg or 13.6 plus or minus se 2.2% of the filtered load of water. After administration of exogenous vasopressin, V fell to 311 plus or minus 157 mul/min/kg or 5.2 plus or minus se 3.8% of the filtered load of water and U/Posm rose from 0.658 plus or minus se 0.043 to 2.124 plus or minus 0.454. Tight junctions of cortical and outer medullary segments of the collecting duct resisted lanthanum penetration. Tight junctions of the inner medullary and papillary segments of the collecting duct were freely permeable to lanthanum suggesting the presence of a paracellular shunt pathway for solute and water movement. The results were independent of the presence or absence of vasopressin. Physiological studies have previously demonstrated that cortical and outer medullary segments of the collecting duct have a low urea permeability while inner medullary and papillary segments of the collecting duct have a relatively high urea permeability. The possibility is suggested that urea movement across the inner medullary and papillary segments of the collecting duct may occur, at least in part, via a paracellular pathway formed by the nonoccluding tight junction and the lateral intercellular space.</AbstractText>"}

In 48 cases multiple cysts were present, while in 65 only a single cyst satisfying the criteria was found. There was an excess number of infants of low birthweight score among those with multiple cysts and the results were highly significant. Cysts, whether single or multiple in distribution, were commoner with increasing gestation, and possibly occurred more commonly in the infants of diabetic mothers and in infants where pregnancy had been complicated by rhesus isoimmunization. The nature of the changes seen in the granulosa lining and theca internal layer surrounding the cysts suggested that these cysts were not some degenerative phenomenon but occured in response to stimulation. It is suggested that homologous changes may occur in the testis of the dysmature male. The possible significance of these findings with regard to hormonal imbalance in the growth-retarded infant is considered, and the need for closer attention to endocrine function in these infants stressed.</AbstractText>"}

Arterial thrombosis, emboli, trauma, congenital heart disease, sepsis, dehydration, coagulopathies, and venipuncture are other possible causes which should be considered.

The mean follow-up time was 15 months (354 months). A significant improvement of symptoms and signs occurred in all but three patients. The level of plasma immunoreactive growth hormone (IRGH) was reduced in all but two patients and a normal level of plasma IRGH was achieved in sixteen patients. Skin thickness, the level of serum inorganic phosphorus and the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and calcium were significantly decreased in the great majority of the patients. The operation was not accompanied by any visual complications, but cerebrospinal rhinorrhoea, subsiding spontaneously, developed in two and postoperative meningitis in one patient. Hypothyroidism and adrenocortical deficiency developed in eight, gonadotrophin deficiency in thirteen, and persistent diabetes insipidus in one patient. It is concluded that transsphenoidal hypophysectomy with cryapplication is a safe and effective method for the treatment of acromegalic patients.</AbstractText>"}

In the homozygous rats there was a marked hypertrophy of the hypothalamic magnocellular structures when stained either for neurosecretory material or neurophysin-like antigens. Neurophysin was present in both the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of homozygous and heterozygous animals. Less than half of the cells in the PVN and SON were stained for neurophysin. This observation was less apparent when histochemical stains were used to visualize the distribution of neurosecretory material. Although it is generally considered that the homozygous Brattleboro rat does not synthesize vasopressin, a positive reaction was observed in the PVN and SON when anti-[8-lysine]-vasopressin serum was employed in the immunohistochemical procedure.</AbstractText>"}

In the families of MODY: 1) twenty-two of twenty-six (85 per cent) propositi had a diabetic parent; 2) 46 per cent of families showed direct vertical transmission of diabetes through three generations; 3) of forty-seven tested siblings twenty-five (53 per cent) had latent diabetes; 4) the diabetic phenotype in the families was consistent, most affected individuals having a noninsulin requiring type of disease. These findings are compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance of MODY, although they do not exclude multifactorial inheritance. In contrast, in the families of JOD: 1) only four (11 per cent) of propositi had a diabetic parent; 2) three generation inheritance was found in only two (6 per cent) of JOD families, and 3) of seventy-four tested siblings eight (11 per cent) were diabetic. This difference provides further evidence of genetic heterogeneity in diabetes mellitus and indicates that there is a need for careful definition of the phenotype of diabetes in populations in which the genetics of diabetes is to be analyzed.

Lymphocytes from twenty-six (42 per cent) of the diabetics showed significant blastogenesis to bovine or porcine insulin, as compared with two (7 per cent) of controls; the phenomenon was shown by both established and newly diagnosed patients including four who had never recieved insulin. The results indicate that cellular hypersensitivity to insulin, as judged by an in vitro test, is relatively common in insulin-treated diabetics without in vivo evidence of allergy, and suggest that hypersensitivity may also be present in untreated diabetics. Lymphocytes from twenty-one of the twenty-six diabetics who responded to intact insulin were further tested using bovine and porcine insulin A chain bovine B chain as antigens. The A chain of either insulin induced significant blastogenesis in only one diabetic but bovine B chain induced significant blastogenesis in fourteen (67 per cent) of the patients tested. These results suggest that B chain is the major antigenic site determining cellular hypersensitivity to insulin. Diabetes 24:36-43, January, 1975.</AbstractText>"}

Relative insulin deficiency was demonstrated although several phenomena characteristic of phenformin-associated lactic acidosis obscured its reflection in the usual indices. From data presented and a review of the literature the following pathogenesis is proposed for the observed metabolic derangement. A background of relative insulin deficiency would permit enhanced pyruvate (and hence lactate) formation from protein sources. Insulin deficiency would also lead to inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase which slows pyruvate removal. Phenformin accumulation (cf impaired renal function) further reduces pyruvate removal by decreasing its conversion to glucose, but in addition alters the redox state. For the lactic acidosis which results, insulin administration may thus constitute specific therapy. Diabetes 24:28-35, January, 1975.</AbstractText>"}

Plasma Beta-OH butyric acid (Beta-OHB) increased to 2.5-4.5 mM and plasma FFA to 1,000-1,400 muEq/L. in normal weight individuals after five to seven days' starvation and in obese subjects after ten to fourteen days' fasting. Acute elevations fo the plasma FFA greater than 1,500 muEq/L. for sixty minutes in fed normal weight and obese subjects with a fat meal-heparin regimen resulted in peak elevations of plasma Beta-OHB (0.25-0.45mM), only 10 percent of that seen during fasting. When plasma FFA were lowered acutely during fasting with the antilipolytic agent Pyrazole to control levels (400-600 muEq/L.), plasma Beta-OHB decreased 35 plus or minus 5 per cent. Comparable lowering of plasma FFA in normal weight or obese starved subjects given dexamethasone to maintain elevated fasting plasma insulin levels resulted in an 87 plus or minus 3 per cent decrease in plasma Beta-OHB. Similar studies in obese fasted subjects pretreated with an intravenous infusion of insulin (1.0 U/hr. for eight hours) before receiving Pyrazole resulted in a 65 plus or minus 5 per cent decrease in plasma Beta-OHB. Plasma Beta-OHB half-life, determined after injections of 12 gm. Beta-OHB, increased significantly during fasting (110 plus or minus 15 minutes) and was decreased when the fasting subjects were maintained on dexamethasone (65 plus or minus 7 minutes). These studies indicate that accelerated hepatic ketogenesis during starvation is a result of both enhanced activity of the enzymatic system(s) involved in ketone body production as well as an increased FFA load. The increase in plasma Beta-OHB during fasting reflects not only an accelerated rate of hepatic ketogenesis but also an impairment of peripheral utilization, both processes apparently being sensitive to insulin.

Systemic features in the patients with DON did not differ from those reported for Graves' disease patients except that patients with DON were older (mean age, 61 years) and did not show female preponderance. Congestive symptoms always preceded visual loss, which was gradual in onset and bilateral in most patients but acute and asymmetrical in several. Presenting acuities were poorer than 20/60 in 50% of cases; central scotomas, sometimes combined with inferior depression, were the predominant field defects. Congestive signs were of moderate intensity without severe proptosis or exposure keratopathy. Bilateral and symmetrical ductional restriction was the most common motility disturbance. Oral corticosteroids were effective in restoring visual function in ten of 21 eyes treated. Many steroid-unresponsive eyes were improved promptly by supervoltage orbital irradiation or surgical decompression. In general, therapeutic intervention appeared to hasten recovery and improve visual outcome.</AbstractText>"}

However, the mean values for the group before and after OGTT remained statistically unchanged, 3) three of eight overt diabetic subjects (38%) showed moderate increase the chromium excretion and Cr/Cre ratio after OGTT, but the mean values were not effected. The creatinine values in urine remained constant before and after OGTT in all groups.

Somatostatin inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release and reduced plasma glucagon by 50%--65%. The rise in plasma glucose after glucose ingestion was initially (at 30--120 min) reduced by somatostatin. However, beyond 3 hr, plasma glucose levels were 50--200 mg/100 ml higher, with somatostatin reaching concentrations at 6 hr that were twofold higher than those observed with saline ( p less than 0.005). The degree of late glucose intolerance was inversely related to postglucose plasma insulin concentrations (p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate a biphasic effect of somatostatin on oral glucose tolerance in maturity-onset diabetes. The exaggerated later hyperglycemia is related to suppression of insulin secretion. The initial blunting of postprandial hyperglycemia may reflect decreased carbohydrate absorption and/or hypoglucagonemia-mediated enhancement of glucose disposal.</AbstractText>"}

The diabetic averages did not differ significantly from the nondiabetic subjects; however, when hyperglycemia was induced by glucose infusion in the nondiabetic subjects so as to simulate the fasting hyperglycemia of the diabetics, mean glucagon fell to 57 mumug (+/-8), which was significantly below the diabetic mean. In 28 healthy subjects the infusion of arginine elicited a rise in glucagon of at least 100 mumug/ml with a peak level averaging 331 mumug/ml (+/-22) at 40 min. This response to arginine was diminished but not abolished during hyperglycemia induced by simultaneous glucose infusion. In everyone of 45 diabetic subjects tested the infusion of arginine elicited a rise in glucagon of at least 140 mumug/ml to levels significantly greater than in nondiabetics. The peak glucagon level in juvenile-type diabetics averaged 458 mumug/ml (SEM +/-36) and in adult-type diabetics averaged 452 mumug/ml (SEM +/-38). The glucagon response to arginine was unrelated to duration of diabetes, to body weight, type of diabetic treatment, or to other known factors. Marked hyperresponsiveness of glucagon to arginine infusion was observed in two patients with advanced Kimmelsteil-Wilson disease. Glucagon levels were markedly elevated in certain patients with severe diabetic ketoacidosis before treatment with insulin. The findings suggest that alpha cell function is inappropriately increased in diabetes mellitus and could play a significant role in the diabetic syndrome.</AbstractText>"}

In all patients serum potassium levels decreased from admission values; one patient became symptomatically hypokalemic. Low serum potassium levels on admission and early vigorous bicarbonate therapy are emphasized as major predisposing factors of symptomatic hypokalemia.

To study this hypothesis, groups of rats were made either hyperinsulinemic or hypoinsulinemic by daily insulin injections, or streptozotocin treatment, respectively. Different levels of hypoinsulinemia were produced by using different doses of streptozotocin (40 and 55 mg/kg). The mean (+/-SE) 9 a.m. plasma insulin level for each experimental group was: hyperinsulinemic animals, 65+/-5 muU/ml; controls, 32+/-3 muU/ml; low dose streptozotocin group, 18+/-3 muU/ml; and high dose streptozotocin group 5+/-2 muU/ml. Isolated adipocytes were prepared from each animal and glucose transport was assessed by measuring the initial rates of uptake of the nonmetabolyzable hexose 2-deoxy glucose. The V(max) and K(m) values for adipocyte glucose transport were calculated from the 2-deoxy glucose uptake data. The results demonstrated that in cells from control animals the V(max) of in vitro adipocyte glucose transport was 7.1+/-0.7 nmol/min per 10(6) cells in the basal state and 22.9+/-0.9 nmol/min per 10(6) cells in the presence of a maximally effective insulin concentration (25 ng/ml) in the buffer. In cells from the experimentally hyperinsulinemic animals these V(max) values were increased to 11.7+/-0.8 and 44.2+/-1.1 nmol/min per 10(6) cells. Using adipocytes from both groups of streptozotocin-treated (high dose, 55 mg/kg; low dose, 40 mg/kg) insulin-deficient diabetic animals, V(max) values were found to be progressively decreased. Thus, in the low dose group, basal-and insulin-stimulated V(max) values were 1.6+/-0.5 and 5.7+/-0.7 nmol/min per 10(6) cells, as compared to values of 0.9+/-0.2 and 1.7+/-0.6 in the high dose group. Thus, when considered as group data a positive relationship was found between circulating plasma insulin levels and adipocyte glucose transport V(max), with increased V(max) values in hyperinsulinemic rats and decreased V(max) values in hypoinsulinemic rats. Furthermore, when the individual data were analyzed, highly significant correlation coefficients were found between the height of the plasma insulin level and both the basal (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.001) and insulin-stimulated (r = 0.93, P &lt; 0.001) V(max) values. The apparent K(m) for 2-deoxy glucose uptake was the same under all conditions. In conclusion, assuming that the V(max) of transport is some function of the number of glucose transport carriers per cell, then these results support the hypothesis that in addition to acute acceleration of glucose transport, insulin is also an important long-term regulator of the number of available adipocyte glucose transport carriers.</AbstractText>"}

The MCR of C-peptide did not differ in normal subjects (4.4 ml/min per kg; range, 3.7-4.9) and in diabetic subjects (4.7 ml/min per kg; range, 3.7-5.8). Employment of both techniques in one subject gave similar MCR. The average half-life of C-peptide in plasma calculated from the last 1-h period of the single-dose injection studies was longer in the insulin-dependent diabetics (42.5 min; range, 39.4-48.5) than in the normal subjects (33.5 min; range, 24.9-45.3). These results indicate that the beta-cell secretory capacity of normal and insulin-dependent diabetic subjects can be compared by measuring the C-peptide concentration in peripheral venous plasma. The difference in the half-life of C-peptide in plasma between diabetics and normals suggests an altered kinetics of the disappearance of the peptide, while the overall metabolism, as expressed by the MCR, is similar.</AbstractText>"}

The biguanide concentration that enhanced Ca2+ uptake maximally was at least 15 times lower than that required for 50 per cent inhibition of respiration. Kinetic studies indicated that the enhanced rate of Ca2+ transport resulted from an increase in Vmax, while Km for Ca2+ was unaffected by the biguanide. Several other organic cations known to lower blood sugar in intact animals or to block the hepatic gluconeogenic response to glucagon also enhanced the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake rate; three of these compounds did not inhibit respiration even at high concentrations. One organic cation, triethyltin, which is a potent respiratory inhibitor that does not affect blood sugar, had no effect on Ca2+ uptake. We concluded that enhancement of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake rate is related to the mechanism of therapeutic blood sugar lowering by these drugs, probably by impairing the gluconeogenic response of the liver to glucagon.</AbstractText>"}

To determine whether this restoration of the acute insulin response is glucose dose dependent and whether complete restoration can be achieved, adult-onset diabetics with a mean fasting plasma glucose value of 216 +/- 20 mg. per deciliter (x +/- S.E.) were stimulated with various doses of intravenous glucose. Restoration occurred in a glucose dose-dependent manner. Complete restoration could not be achieved with the maximal tolerable glucose dose (80 gm.). Second phase insulin secretion also improved in a glucose dose-dependent manner. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that defective insulin secretion in adult-onset, hyperglycemic diabetics is not due to absolute deficiency of insulin but may be a result of defective recognition of glucose signals by pancreatic B-cells--a defect that can be partially reversed by sodium salicylate.</AbstractText>"}

After four months of diabetes, glomeruli of the unclipped kidney of hypertensive diabetic rats had markedly increased diabetic changes, including mesangial matrix thickening and mesangial immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) and complement (C3) localization, when compared with glomeruli of the contralateral-clipped kidneys. Further, glomeruli of the unclipped kidneys of hypertensive diabetic animals had more mesangial thickening and IgG and IgM staining than glomeruli of normotensive diabetic rats. Although glomeruli of clipped kidneys in hypertensive diabetic rats had less mesangial thickening than glomeruli of normotensive diabetic rats, this did not reach statistical significance. However, these glomeruli did have significantly less IgG, IgM, and C3 staining compared with glomeruli of normotensive diabetic animals. Mesangial thickness in glomeruli of clipped and unclipped nondiabetic hypertensive rats did not differ from that in normal animals. However, there was less mesangial IgG staining in clipped than in unclipped kidneys of nondiabetic hypertensive rats or in kidneys of normal animals. We have interpreted these results to imply that alterations in nephron hemodynamics combine with the diabetic state to influence the rate of development of diabetic glomerulopathy in rats.</AbstractText>"}

The results were as follows: Most of the juvenile and intermediate type diabetics were poorly controlled, with the glomerular lesion progressing rather rapidly. In contrast, many cases of the adult type were able to be maintained under good control and the renal lesion neither developed nor progressed. Two of the adult type diabetics with poor control showed slowly and slightly progressing renal lesions. The progression of glomerular lesions was significantly related to the control of blood glucose, type of diabetes, age at onset, type of treatment, and degree of obesity, but not to the duration of diabetes or the length of the follow-up period. There was a significant correlation between the type of diabetes and the control of blood glucose over the years. Arteriolar lesions developed concurrently with the progression of the glomerular lesion. Retinopathy also had a tendency to develop in proportion to the progress of glomerular lesions although it was not statistically significant. We have discussed the clinical factors responsible for the progression of diabetic glomerulosclerosis and have suggested that the type of diabetes rather than the degree of control of blood glucose might be more important in determining the development and progression of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that successful control of blood glucose may prevent or retard the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

In the medically treated group, anticoagulant therapy reduced the frequency of TIAs, but did not appear to protect patients from stroke. Mortality was 23% at four years, 57% of deaths being attributable to myocardial infarction and 38% to stroke.</AbstractText>"}

Supine PA in group 1 was 38 +/- 7 ng. per deciliter, whereas in normals it was 24 +/- 2 ng. per deciliter (P less than 0.05); beyond that, neither supine nor upright PA or PRA differed significantly from normal in groups 1 and 2. By contrast, in group 3, supine PA was 13 +/- 1 ng. per deciliter and PRA 2.0 +/- 0.2 ng./ml. and upright PA was 39 +/- 7 ng. per deciliter and PRA 3.8 +/- 0.5 ng./ml., all significantly lower than those in the other groups (P less than 0.01). Nine patients, one in group 1 and eight in group 3, had low supine and upright PA and PRA; four had hyperkalemia. An additional nine patients in group 3 had low upright PA, with normal or low PRA; two had hyperkalemia. Of the 18 patients with low upright PA, K correlated with glucose (R = 0.46, P less than 0.05). These results suggest (1) the renin-aldosterone system generally responds normally in diabetics without nephropathy but responds subnormally when nephropathy is present, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is frequent in diabetics with nephropathy but may occur in the absence of clinical nephropathy, and (3) hyperkalemia in some diabetic patients may be secondary to hypoaldosteronemia and hyperglycemia.</AbstractText>"}

We report here on values obtained by the use of mercury-in-rubber strain gauge plethysmography on 15 middle-aged, adult-onset diabetics who had minimal clinical evidence of microangiopathy. Standard tests are described for assessing forearm vascular function at rest, during tonic exercise of the fingers, and after interrupted repetitive exercise of the fingers. When matched against a similar aged nondiabetic group, the diabetics had slightly higher forearm vascular resistance at each level of exercise, a marked reduction (approximately 50 per cent) in capillary filtration coefficient, which is believed to be related to vascular filtering surface area, and a slight reduction in venous capacitance at all levels of exercise. The method of mercury-in-rubber strain gauge venous occlusion plethysmography provides the clinician with a sensitive and inexpensive tool with which to follow the evolution of angiopathy in diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

Employing arbitrary criteria, we calculated a 'reproducibility index' as a quantitative measure of blood glucose variability in each subject. No significant difference was found in the reproducibility of OGTT versus IVGTT, nor in normals versus the offspring. Only about 50 per cent of the tests in normals and in the offspring could be considered to be 'reproducible.' The offspring revealed greater correlations of several parameters, particularly insulin secretion, between the two IVGTTs and between the two OGTTs as compared with the normal group. However, the blood glucose variations tended to be considerably greater in the offspring from one to the other test.</AbstractText>"}

Arterial and hepatic venous concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, free fatty acids, fructose, and oxygen were measured. Hepatic blood flow was also determined. At constant rates of splanchnic fructose extraction, an 82 per cent diminution of the arterial hepatic venous concentration difference of the ketones was observed but the arteriovenous difference of free fatty acis rose moderately. Since hepatic blood flow was only slightly increased (17 per cent) there was no doubt that total hepatic ketone body formation was reduced. The magnitude of this antiketogenic action became apparent from the continuous fall of the arterial ketone concentrations. Since splanchnic oxygen uptake rose 40 per cent, it is suggested that the antiketogenic effect of fructose was due not only to enhanced re-esterification but also to accelerated oxidation of free fatty acids.</AbstractText>"}

A modification of the monocyte insulin radioreceptor technique permitted distinct separation of human erythrocytes with their bound insulin from the free insulin. When incubated with 80 pg. per milliliter of 125I-insulin (pH 8.0, 3.5 hours, 15 degrees C.), erythrocytes from 17 normal volunteers specifically bound 10 per cent (+/- 1.450 S.D.) of the total 125I-insulin. Less than 15 per cent of the total 125I-insulin bound was nonspecific. Binding of 125I-insulin to human erythrocytes was dependent on pH and temperature. Less than 5 per cent of the insulin available to the plasma membrane was degraded. Both calcium and magnesium enhanced 125I-insulin binding by 100 per cent but had no synergistic effect when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. Scatchard analysis of the binding data resulted in a curvilinear plot with characteristics typical of negative cooperative interactions between receptor sites and with an unoccupied site affinity constant of 0.1 X 10(8) M-1. Human erythrocytes have 2,000 insulin binding sites per erythrocyte with 14 sites per square micrometer of surface area. The readily available human erythrocyte, thus, has both specific insulin binding sites and binding characteristics similar to other human cell types. These studies have provided the basis for further clinical investigation of polypeptide hormone receptors on human erythrocytes.</AbstractText>"}

To study that possibility, ISO was infused into normal rats and rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus (DI rats) due to a genetic defect in ADH production. Doses previously used (0.2 mug per kg per min, and doses 10 and 100 fold less were infused. At 0.002 mug per kg per min, urine osmolality in both groups of rats declined (DI rats from 177 plus or minus 22 to 141 plus or minus 13 MOsm per kg, P greater than 0.01, and normals from 162 plus or minus 17 to 142 plus or minus 15 MOsm per kg, P greater than 0.05).

Compared with the normal group, the patients with cystic fibrosis had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and significantly lower serum immunoreactive insulin levels during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests; serum insulin levels were also significantly lower after intravenous administration of tolbutamide in the patients with cystic fibrosis, but the reduction in blood glucose concentration in each group was not significantly different. During an intravenous insulin test, the decrease in blood glucose concentration was the same for both groups, in spite of significantly lower serum insulin levels in the patients with cystic fibrosis .The percentage fall in plasma free fatty acids was at least as great in the patients with cystic fibrosis as in normals during the test procedures; while a significant decrease in plasma alpha-amino nitrogen after intravenously administered insulin was seen only in the patients with cystic fibrosis. These studies suggest that the carbohydrate intolerance of cystic fibrosis is consequent upon an impaired insulin response to glucose, but that this insulin deficiency is partly compensated for by increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin.</AbstractText>"}

Brachial artery and hepatic vein catheters were inserted and splanchnic blood flow determined using indocyanine green. The glucagon infusion resulted in a mean circulating plasma level of 4,420 pg/ml. In the normal subjects, the glucagon infusion resulted in stimulation of insulin secretion indicated by rising levels of immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide immunoreactivity. Arterial glycerol concentration (an index of lipolysis) declined markedly and net splanchnic total ketone production was virtually abolished. In contrast, the diabetic subjects secreted no insulin (no rise in C-peptide immunoreactivity) in response to glucagon. Arterial glycerol and net splanchnic total ketone production in these subjects rose significantly (P=&lt;0.05) when compared with the results in four diabetics who received a saline infusion after undergoing the same catheterization procedure.Net splanchnic glucose production rose markedly during glucagon stimulation in the normals and diabetics despite the marked rise in insulin in the normals. Thus, the same level of circulating insulin which markedly suppressed lipolysis and ketogenesis in the normals failed to inhibit the glucagon-mediated increase in net splanchnic glucose production. It is concluded (a) that glucagon at high concentration is capable of stimulating lipolysis and ketogenesis in insulin-deficient diabetic man; (b) that insulin, mole for mole, has more antilipolytic activity in man than glucagon has lipolytic activity; and (c) that glucagon, on a molar basis, has greater stimulatory activity than insulin has inhibitory activity on hepatic glucose release.</AbstractText>"}

A review of the literature reveals that this technique and other transsphenoidal routes to the hypophysis were performed more than half a century ago.These procedures fell into disfavor because fo low magnification and insufficient illumination of the operative field, infection and inadequate postoperative endocrine replacement therapy. With today's antibiotic therapy and hormonal replacement, plus the use of the operating microscope, the transsphenoidal route to the hypophysis has gained renewed interest among neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists. Each of the transsphenoidal routes and the advantages of the 'from below' approach are described. The applications of transsphenoidal approach and the nonsurgical modalities for hypophysectomy are reviewed. The simplicity and safety of the sublabial transseptal transsphenoidal approach depend on a thorough familiarity with the surgical anatomy, proper positioning of the patient, and the availability of appropriate instrumentation. Photographs of specially prepared whole head anatomical specimens plus skull dissections with radiographic correlation illustrate the pertinent anatomy. Some of the vital structures to be identified and avoided are the optic canals, carotid arteries, circular sinuses, cavernous sinuses, III, IV, V, VI cranial nerves, foramen rotundum, medial walls of the orbits, medial walls of maxillary sinuses, medial pterygoid plates and pterygoid canals. A method for preoperative determination of key distances within the patient's skull is described along with other preoperative tests. This paper discusses the self-retaining speculum and other new instruments for this procedure. A gauge mounted on the front end of the speculum is calibrated to measure the size of the opening at the tip of the speculum. Thirty cases are included in this report, six of which are presented in detail. No operative mortality, CSF rhinorrhea, visual damage carotid or cavernous sinus hemorrhage fracture of the medial pterygoid plates or maxilla were encountered in this series. Three patients developed diabetes insipidus and two patients had meningitis which responded to antibiotic therapy.</AbstractText>"}

Each of the patients received insulin in a dose of 0.1 U/kg BW by the im, sc, and iv routes in a randomized fashion on 3 different days. Plasma glucose, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), and immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) were measured at intervals over the first 4 h. The t1/2 (mean +/- SEM) after iv administration of insulin in obese and lean diabetics was, respectively, 5.3 +/- 0.2 and 4.8 +/- 0.4 min; these were not significantly different. Intravenous injection produced its highest level of IRI in 2 min in both groups. Thereafter, a rapid drop was observed with return to the basal level by 90 min. Equivalent amounts of im and sc insulin produced a maximal increase in plasma IRI at 60 min in both groups. Plasma IRI after iv insulin injection was significantly higher than after sc and im insulin injections at 10 and 20 min (P less than 0.001) and significantly lower than the im and sc groups at 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min (P less than 0.001). After iv insulin, plasma glucose at 30, 40, 50, and 60 min was significantly lower than after im and sc insulin (P less than 0.001), but over the 4-h study period, the glucose-lowering effect and the area under the curves for glucose response to IRI by the three routes were the same in both lean and obese diabetic subjects. The mean basal IRI in lean patients was 18 +/- 4 microU/ml, which was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in obese patients (26 +/- 2 microU/ml). No significant difference was observed in fasting IRG in lean (96 +/- 12 pg/ml) vs. obese (108 +/- 10 pg/ml) patients. No significant increase in IRG was noted with equivalent amounts of sc, im, and iv injection in the lean and obese patients. These studies demonstrated that although iv injection of insulin produces a more rapid initial decline in plasma glucose, the overall glucose-lowering effect by insulin given iv, im or sc is similar in nonketotic lean or obese diabetic subjects.</AbstractText>"}

The diet must take into account not only the metabolic requirements of the mother, but also those of the developing fetus. A total weight gain of 22 to 26 pounds is recommended, with the pattern of weight gain being more important than the total amount. Pregnancy is not a time for weight reduction. Caloric requirements can be met by the addition of 300 kcal. per day to the prepregnancy meal plan, or about 36 kcal. per kilogram. This can be met by the addition of 50 gms., carbohydrate and 30 gms. protein. Diets will contain approximately 1800 to 2500 calories a day. Calcium, iron, folic acid, and sodium also require attention in meal planning. The importance of regular meals and snacks must be emphasized. In particular, bed-time snacks are important because of the tendency towards overnight hypoglycemia and ketosis.</AbstractText>"}

Of 411 nondiabetic persons screened on admission to the Jewish Home for the Aged (J.H.A.) since 1968, 15 per cent had abnormally elevated levels of postglucose blood sugar (PGBS) as compared with 25 per cent in the period 1964-1968. Fewer positive reactors were discovered with annual screenings and with the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Although the proportion of positive reactors and of diabetic-type GTT curves was higher in subjects over age 80 than under age 80, there were 83 residents screened annually for five to nine years who retained normal glucose tolerance despite advancing age. The relatively lower rate of deterioration of glucose tolerance in the second period was attributable to: 1) the younger age of residents admitted since 1968, and 2) the diabetes-oriented diet plus emphasis on exercise and prevention of obesity. The reactive hypoglycemia found in 6 per cent of the residents was asymptomatic, whereas iatrogenic hypoglycemia was usually symptomatic and often severe. This led to a deliberate policy of undertreatment. Dietotherapy induced a lasting remission in about 60 per cent of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes, often to the point of normal glucose tolerance. Early diagnosis of chemical diabetes, by postponing or obviating the need for antidiabetic therapy, reduced the incidence of iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Diabetes-oriented measures are recommended for the aged in general, and for residents of homes for the aged in particular.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":1109356,"Title":"Restricted replicative life-span of diabetic fibroblasts in vitro: its relation to microangiopathy.","Journal":"Federation proceedings","Date":"Jan 1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The finding that diabetic microangiopathy is caused by accumulation of multiple layers of basal lamina and experiments in which similar basal lamina layering is produced when new cell generations repopulate preexisting basal lamina scaffolding (from which previous cell generations have shed) indicate, that the rates of cell death and cell replenishment are accelerated in diabetics. Because the lesions are focal and regional and develop at different ages and in different time sequences, we have proposed that the accelerated cell turnover is probably caused by increased vulnerability of diabetic cells to injury which in turn may represent the expression of a genetically transmitted defect. To test whether this aberration can be detected in vitro, we examined the replicative life-span of skin fibroblasts from three nondiabetics, three age- and sex-matched diabetics and one individual with acquired hyperglycemia due to pancreatitis. Cells of diabetics exhibited about half the number of population doublings as cells from nondiabetics (0.01 less than P less than 0.025). Cells of the individual with pancreatitis generated a normal number of cell doublings. The interpretation that fits best with all data is that decreased replicative life span of diabetic fibroblasts in vitro is also an expression of increased susceptibility of diabetics' cells to injury and dying.</AbstractText>"}

The body and tail of the pancreas were transplanted into the side of the Roux-en-Y retroperitoneal limb of jejunum. A dual venous anastomosis of the splenic vein to the vena cava was utilized to avoid venous congestion. Mean survival with normoglycemia was 32.4 days in thirty dogs with autografts and 24.6 days in twenty-seven dogs with allografts. Two dogs with autotransplants remain alive at 106 and 128 days, and the longest normoglycemic survival achieved with an allograft was 85 days. With experience the incidence of pancreatitis and abscess formation decreased. The problem of venous thrombosis was eliminated and the patency of the pancreatic duct was maintained.</AbstractText>"}

Eighty-eight per cent of the entire group have functioning kidneys at present, and 93 per cent of those in the high risk group have functioning kidneys. Evaluation of pretransplant mixed lymphocyte cultures, HL-A antigen, and immune responder status; close follow-up observation of lymphocyte culture and humoral responses by in vitro testing; and the use of antilymphoblast globulin are considered to be the reasons for the improved results.</AbstractText>"}

It has been stressed that monitoring is an ongoing process which begins with the initial evaluation and continues throughout the patient's hospital stay. The level of monitoring and thus the parameters to be monitored are determined on an individualized basis according to the patient's clinical status and his level of stupor and coma. It has been suggested that for mild head injuries, adequate monitoring includes periodic evaluation of the neurological status and vital signs; but the more severely injured patients require extensive and frequent monitoring of a large number of clinical and physiological parameters. Among the many parameters, the continuous monitoring of ICP and the respiratory system are perhaps the most useful indicators of the patient's condition. Several methods for continuous ICP monitoring which are readily adaptable to most neurosurgical practices have been discussed. These include the intraventricular catheter, subarachnoid screw, and the closed Rickham reservoir connected to a ventricular catheter. In our institution, the Rickham reservoir has been used to monitor ICP and at the time of this report, satisfactory ICP recordings have been obtained in 27 of 30 head injury patients. Although this method requires a small surgical procedure, we believe that the decreased incidence of infection, the rapid access to ventricular fluid, and its potential for long term monitoring justify its use. Suggestions for monitoring other physiological parameters have also been presented. Particular emphasis has been placed on the management of infants and children with head injuries. The clinical entity of chronic subdural hematoma in infants and children has been used to illustrate the value of ICP monitoring as a guide to further treatment. Finally, we have briefly discussed the place of computers in day to day patient care, research, and monitoring.</AbstractText>"}

Sixteen of the grafts were preserved for 24 hours, nine with continuous hypothermic albumin perfusion, seven with hypothermic storage. Five dogs died from early postoperative bleedings. Fifteen surviving dogs had a satisfying endocrine function assessed by blood glucose and serum insulin during fasting and after glucose load. In six dogs the glucagon release from the graft was investigated and significant release was evident in all dogs. A high release was found after L-arginine stimulation. The endocrine function was satisfying after 24 hour preservation both with hypothermic storage and continuous hypothermic albumin perfusion. During such perfusion the pancreas became very oedematous. This did not influence on the outcome of the transplantation. The grafts were enlarged four to eight days after transplantation. Oedema, fibrotic changes and collagen depositions in the interstitial tissue were observed in light microscopy. These changes seemed to come earlier in glands preserved for 24 hours. Islet cells were identified in all functioning grafts and seemed histopathologically and ultrastructurally unchanged. A duct-ligated pancreatic segment was allografted to one diabetic patient in a pilot experiment. There was a satisfying endocrine function for 40 days. After that the graft became necrotic due to thrombus formation.</AbstractText>"}

In the early phases of the disease, alterations in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, glomerular permeability and tubular capacity for glucose reabsorption occur. In the late stages of juvenile onset diabetes, renal failure is a common cause of death. For this reason, increasing attention is being paid to the possibility of long-term dialysis and renal transplantation in these patients. The kidneys play an important role in regulating insulin metabolism. The renal arteriovenous difference is approximately 30-45% and a linear relationship exists between the arterial insulin level and the renal arteriovenous concentration difference. The renal extraction of insulin is 200 ml/min in man, and it is estimated that 6-8 U are removed and degraded by the kidney in 24 h. The quantity of insulin in urine is small. However, its clearance is relatively constant over a wide range of serum concentrations and is 0.15-0.5 ml/min. The mean basal insulin excretion is 3.6 muU/mg creatinine, and a fourfold rise occurs following a glucose load. The urinary insulin values in neonates, children and patients with diabetes and renal failure are reviewed. In diabetic patients, progressive renal disease is accompanied by decreasing insulin requirements. In contrast, nondiabetic patients who develop renal failure frequently show abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism, the commonest of which is a pseudodiabetic state.</AbstractText>"}

Antibodies against arginine vasopressin (AVP), lysine-vasopressin (LVP) and oxytocin were raised by injecting these hormones that were covalently bound to thyroglobulin into rabbits. The vasopressin-immunized rabbits showed periods of diabetes insipidus, while histoloty of the 'hns revealed an intact neurosecretory system with signs of increased endogenous hormone synthesis in the supraoptic nucleus and increased release in the neuro-hypophysis of some rabbits. The daily water intake of the oxytocin-immunized rabbits was similar to that of control rabbits. The development of antibodies against vasopressin as measured in the immunofluorescence procedure showed a course that was quite different from the curve of the titer as determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Also the specificity of the antibodies used in the immunofluorescence procedure was found to be quite different from their specificity in a RIA system. Potency and specificity of the antibodies have to be studied therefore within the immunofluorescence procedure itself. Using freshly frozen acetone-postfixed hypotalami or pituitaries, no sharp localization of immunofluorescence could be obtained in the HNS. Therefore prefixation was performed. Both, the type and the duration of prefixation revealed quite different results regarding the immunofluorescence in the neurosecretory cell boides in the hypotalamus and of their endings in the neurohypophysis. The best immunofluorescence results were obtained using 6 hours glyoxal-prefixation for the hypothalamus and 24 hours formalin-prefixation for the pituitary. The cross-reaction of the antibodies for oxytocin or vasopressin was tested on synthetic hormones that were bound to CNBR-activated agarose beads and mounted on glass sides. All anti-plasmas showed cross-reaction on beads containing the heterologou- antigen. The plasmas were purified by incubation with  beads containing the heterologous hormone until the cross-reacting component had been removed. Using purified antibodies, the distribution of oxytocin and vasopressin cells within the HNS was investigated. More oxytocin containing cells were localized in the rostral part and more vasopressin in the caudal part of both, the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Comparable percentages of oxytocin and vasopressin containing cells were found in the SON and PVN. The absolute amount of oxytocin containing cells was 2.5 times more in the SON than in the PVN, which seems to contradict the 'classical' view that the PVN predominantly or entirely synthetizes oxytocin. In addition, fluorescence was found using antobodies against vasopressin in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in Wistar rats and heterozygous Brattleboro rats, but not in this nucleus of homozygous Brattleboros.</AbstractText>"}

Special foods for individuals with diabetes mellitus are not necessary to achieve the dietary objectives recommended by leading United States and European authorities. They can be achieved conveniently and at minimum expense through enlightened choices of commonly available food items. At present, specific and unique characteristics of food products with special therapeutic properties for diets of diabetic individuals cannot be delineated or defined on rational nutritional grounds. Such terms as 'diet', 'dietetic', and 'diabetic' on food labels have no uniform meaning for consumers, and diabetologists have observed that patients tend to consume such foods without regard to their energy content. Some consumers regard the reduced-calorie and low-calorie prepared food products as convenient in diets for weight reduction and diabetes although their use in dietary management of diabetes has no therapeutic basis other than weight reduction and maintenance. When fed as pure substances to fasted subjects, the nonglucose carbohydrate nutritive sweeteners, fructose, xylitol, and sorbitol, are absorbed relatively slowly and produce less postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin response than sucrose or glucose. Adequate studies of their long-term effectiveness when ingested as part of mixed meals have not been conducted. Although these sucrose substitutes are generally considered safe, the significance of recent information on possible carcinogenicity of oral xylitol in long-term feeding studies has not been fully evaluated. In view of the lack of certain essential information on the long-term effectiveness of various diets in preventing or mitigating the chronic debilitating complication of diabetes, suggestions for future research are included.</AbstractText>"}

The current controversy about the risks of their use to human health has surfaced from research findings that report an increased incidence of cancer, primarily of the urinary bladder, in certain animal species and man chronically exposed to these agents. The April 1977 proposal by the Food and Drug Administration to restrict use of saccharin was based on these investigations. The intense public response against any ban has led to Congressional deliberations over the fate of saccharin during the present moratorium and information-gathering period. Since diabetic patients are among the principal users of this compound, it appears timely to review the evidence for and against its carcinogenic potential.</AbstractText>"}

Forty-seven of these patients had osteomyelitis, and 13 had joint infections, including 3 prosthetic replacements. The patients' average was 35 years and there was no predilection for any particular skeletal location. Only 6 patients had no associated predisposing medical problems. Of these problems fracture, diabetes and narcotic abuse were most common. Thirty patients had Psuedomonas infection, and 15 others had multiple pathogens including Pseudomonas. Aminoglycoside antibiotics had been previously used in 25. Amikacin was given for an average of 22 days with a mean dose of 13.4 mg/kg. Bone and synovial fluid levels of amikacin were in therapeutic range. At least 48 patients had concurrent local wound treatment in addition to parenteral administration of amikacin. In 47 patients enough information was available to determine the efficacy of treatment. Twenty-seven (57%) of these patients were considered cured, both clinically and for bacteriologic response; and additional 9 (19%) were considered partially cured. Amikacin is effective against susceptible pathogens in bone and joint infections and is a reasonable choice when aminoglycoside antibiotic is indicated.</AbstractText>"}

The template activity of the chromatins of insulin-treated diabetic rats is found to be 28 per cent greater than that of chromatin from liver of diabetic rats not treated with insulin. Time course studies show that the template activity of liver chromatin of rats injected with a single dose of insulin reaches a peak at two hours, which is some hours before the appearance of a typical insulin-induced liver enzyme, glucokinase.

The latest step in the purification of insulin extracted from pork pancreas now allows treatment of diabetics with protamine-pork-insulin without causing formation of insulin-antibodies in at least 90 per cent treated with insulin through several months. In only 3 out of 51 diabetics was it possible to demonstrate insulin-antibodies. This new step may be of great interest in two ways 1) it is now possible to make insulin-estimations in the plasma of insulin-treated cases and 2) it will be possible to find out whether elimination of insulin-antibody-formation will reduce the degree of vascular lesions in diabetics, such lesions being the greatest problem in clinical diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

Drugs acting on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle have a powerful but short acting diuretic effect; they include frusemide, ethacrynic acid and bumetanide. The benzothiadiazines and related compounds have a moderate diuretic action spread over a longer period, whilst the potassium-sparing diuretics, triamterene, amiloride and spironolactone, have only a weak diuretic effect but a marked ability to diminish urinary potassium excretion. The fourth group is made up of miscellaneous substances which function as vasodilator or osmotic agents. The pathogenesis of oedema formation in heart failure is outlined and a logical approach to treatment suggested. Duiretics are being increasingly used in the treatment of non-oedematous states, in particular hypertension, diabetes insipidus and hypercalciuria; their exact role in pregnancy and acute renal failure remains controversial. Side-effects can be related to their effect on electrolyte excretion and include hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hyperuricaemia. The incidence of disturbed carbohydrate tolerance in previously normal individuals is low. Other less common side-effects are also discussed.</AbstractText>"}

A clinical and histopathological study of three cases treated with diazoxide and subtotal pancreatectomy.","Journal":"Acta pathologica et microbiologica Scandinavica. Section A, Pathology","Date":"Jan 1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Two boys and one girl developed persisting hypoglycaemia 12, 24, and 48 hours after birth. Although there was no known history of hereditary diabetes mellitus, the birth weight was high in two cases, and some additional traits of foetopathia diabetica could not be excluded clinically. All had high serum insulin levels with frank hyperinsulinaemia in one case. Glucose tolerance tests also indicated hyperinsulinism. Diazoxide (8 to 27 mg/kg) elevated the blood glucose levels, but did not prevent severe hypoglycaemic episodes. The effects of subtotal pancreatectomy were only transient. The patients have now been kept on permanent diazoxide therapy for 2-4 years at dosages slightly lower than those used before operation. No islet-cell tumour was found at the subtotal pancreatectomy. In all 3 cases, the pancreatic islets were markedly hyperplastic and of irregular shape with the occurrence of large B-cells with giant hyperchromatic nuclei and chromophobe 'agranular' or sparsely granulated cells. The predominating kind of islet cells showed tinctorial features of A2-cells but--in the absence of available material set aside for ultrastructural analysis--it could not be settled whether this was a result of a proliferation of A2-cells only or of 'type IV cells' as well. Against the background of previously published reports, the present cases serve to illustrate that additional accuracy of diagnosis and classification of neonatal persistent hypoglycaemia requires quantitative information about the structural changes in the pancreatic islet cells, and that this can be obtained from conventional biopsy specimens.</AbstractText>"}

It must be noted that photocoagulation and pituitary ablation impede but do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Pars plana vitrectomy can be highly effective for removing blood from the vitreous of the eye, allowing better vision, particularly if the retina has been shown to be functional by electrophysiologic testing and ultrasonography. In addition, vitrectomy allows the ophthalmologist to visualize, evaluate, and treat the diabetic retina by photocoagulation or other methods. Attempts at better regulation of blood sugar have reduced the development of microangiopathy in experimental animals and recently in man. The benefits of rigorous regulation of the blood sugar has been noted in a policy statement by the American Diabetes Association. The development of a practical, beneficial pancreas has been undertaken, and may be required in order to reap the full benefits of rigorous blood sugar control. It has been recommended that all patients be evaluated by an ophthalmologist as soon as they have been found to have diabetes, that all diabetics be examined ophthalmologically on an annual basis, and that patients with significant retinopathy be seen at 6 month or shorter intervals by their ophthalmologist. The evaluation and treatment of diabetic retinopathy has progressed enormously during the past decade. It is hoped that the cause of diabetic microangiopathy and retinopathy will be discovered in the near future so that treatment will ultimately cure rather than control the process of diabetic retinopathy.</AbstractText>"}

No differences were detected between males and females or between kidney-transplanted and nontransplanted diabetics. No correlation was noted between intensity of staining and duration of diabetes. The presence of certain serum proteins within vascular and nonvascular basement membranes in diabetics is not restricted to the kidney and may reflect widespread alterations in extracellular membranes that permit entrapment of these proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Hormonal investigation showed that basal prolactin levels were moderately elevated the first two years after the accident, but later returned to normal. There was no rise in prolactin after administration on chlorpromazine, and the response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone was attenuated. Basal luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were low and there was no change after administration of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone. There was also no growth hormone elevation following arginine infusion. On the other hand, there was a normal but delayed elevation of thyrotropin in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Appropriate stimulation tests showed normal responsiveness of the thyroid, adrenals and testes. These findings are compatible with an injury to the pituitary stalk, damaging the neurohypophyseal tract and affecting the blood supply to the pituitary gland.</AbstractText>"}

Segmental and focal fluctuations in basement membrane width appeared to be the most important cause of variance, particularly in thick walled vessels, although multiple instrumental and technical sources of error were also present. As a result, in diabetics there was a mean variability of +/-25% when measurements from two different sets of capillaries in the same subject were compared. Patients older than 12 years and diabetics with longer duration of the disease or abnormal findings on ophthalmoscopic examination exhibited a significant increase in capillary basal lamina. The mean ABLT averaged 1.8 times the mean MBLT, but the relative individual measurements as well as statistical correlations with clinical parameters were similar. Muscle capillary basement membrane hypertrophy, as quantitated by the present methods, does not seem to be an early, sensitive or consistent finding to identify individual diabetics.</AbstractText>"}

There was a prompt (1 month), significant (p smaller than 0.05 minus 0.001), and sustained (36 months) lowering of serum cholesterol in the colestipol HCl-treated group, but no significant change in the placebo group. Serum triglycerides increased in both treatment groups in parallel; the reason was not apparent. Side effects were equally distributed between colestipol HCl and placebo and were primarily gastrointestinal (upper abdominal distress, constipation). Colestipol HCl appears to be a safe and effective treatment for hypercholesterolemia; tolerance does not seem to develop.</AbstractText>"}

In order to compare the exocrine pancreatic function in these three groups of animals, pancreatic secretion was collected from each animal following an intravenous infusion of secretin and pancreozymin. Pancreatic enzyme activity, bicarbonate concentration, and the total volume of pancreatic secretion were all significantly decreased in guinea pigs with overt diabetes, but not in those with latent diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic histologic changes characteristic of both latent and overt diabetes were beta-cell hyperplasia and generalized fatty degeneration of the acini. Only the animals with overt diabetes showed total degranulation and severe vacuolation of theta-cells. The same type of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction observed in guinea pigs with spontaneous overt diabetes mellitus is found in human diabetics, and is particularly common in the juvenile type. The guinea pig, therefore, appears to be a suitable animal model for the study of human juvenile diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

Statistically significant basement membrane thickening is seen in all diabetic groups in most true capillaries and vessels proximal to them, especially in terminal arterioles and metarterioles, although the degree and extent of the changes vary among different clinical groups and vessel types. The basement membrane thickening is characterized by increased amorphous, granular, and fibrillary material with occasional scattered collagenous fibrils. Although nonspecific, basement membrane thickening in microvessels at, and especially proximal to, the level of true capillaries is intimately related to diabetes. Gingival biopsy may possibly be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The replicative capacity of cells is dimished in diabetes mellitus and certain related disorders such as progeria and Werner's syndrome, all of which feature accelerated aging. Expression of HL-A antigens is reduced in progeria fibroblasts compared to normal cultures at corresponding stages of passage. Normal cells show more subtle alteration during aging in vitro probably related to clonal heterogeneity and/or selection within mass cultures. Early-passage fibroblasts interact rapidly with polymerizing fibrin to form a mature clot which is then retracted by a process dependent on cellular integrity and active metabolism. Late-passage cultures are less active in both parameters as are fibroblasts from a subject with progeria. These observations, in total, may relate to altered self-recognition and certain autoimmune concomitants of aging in vivo. They may also help to explain impaired wound healing and increased predisposition to atherothrombosis in aging and diabetic individuals. This system of cultured human fibroblasts should serve as an excellent model to investigate the cellular and molecular basis of diabetes mellitus, aging and related pathology.</AbstractText>"}

Previous abortion was most rare among women having their first baby and increased with increasing birth order up to the fourth, thereafter decreasing. It was positively correlated with maternal age and negatively with age at marriage. There was no effect of years of schooling, when other variables were taken into account, but there were significant differences between ethnic groups, abortion being commonest among Jewish women from North African countries and more prevalent in those from western and Asian countries than in the second-generation Israel-born or in Arab women.Women who reported abortions were less likely to be strict as regards religious observance and less likely to have had a previous stillbirth or child death, other variables being equal. They were more likely to be smokers or former smokers and to be delivered of their babies in certain obstetric units. They more often reported vomiting, bleeding, and medication in early pregnancy. On the other hand, there was no significant association with diabetes, anaemia, blood groups, or season of birth.The findings show that women reporting previous induced abortions differ significantly from other pregnant women in a wide range of demographic and health characteristics. Such women may also be biased for complications of pregnancy and outcome, particularly if selected from a clinic population. Observations that indicate a deleterious effect of induced abortions on subsequent pregnancy outcomes must therefore be interpreted with considerable caution.</AbstractText>"}

Pancreatic carcinoma, especially, may have an improved prognosis with earlier detection as a result of refinements in arteriography, cytology, pancreatic radioisotopic scanning, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Acute pancreatitis results most commonly from alcoholism, biliary tract disease, and trauma. Management is directed primarily at decreasing pancreatic exocrine secretion. Surgery is usually best avoided in the acute phase. Chronic pancreatitis is most often a result of recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. Diabetes and malassimilation become manifest as pancreatic destruction progresses. Management consists of replacement of pancreatic enzymes and diet supplements. Once chronic pancreatitis is established, surgery can only be directed at complications of the disease. Pancreatic ascites is usually associated with a break in the pancreatic ductal system. Ascites caused by trauma responds well to surgical intervention, but the alcoholic type is less amenable to treatment.</AbstractText>"}

However, when WAG spleen and pancreas were transplanted en bloc to AGUS rats, endocrine pancreas graft function persisted for up to 6 weeks. This finding of a transient protection of pancreas allografts by donor-strain spleen allografts led to further experiments. AGUS recipients first received WAG spleen allografts which then were removed after 3 to 5 months, at which time WAG pancreas allografts were inserted. Sixty-eight per cent of these grafts survived and cured their hosts of streptozotocin-induced diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The characteristic changes of diabetic angiopathy are already visible in the angiogram before the ophthalmoscopic and biomicroscopic features of d.r. become manifest (preretinopathic stage). Like in the later stages of d.r., hyperpermeability of the retinal capillaries predominates in certain patients, whilst stenosis and obstruction of the precapillaries and arterioles prevail in the remaining patients. Hyperpermeability frequently causes a decrease in, or a failure of perfusion of the retinal capillaries due to compression by the swollen perivascular tissue. D.r. is characterised by phasic development. In cases of primary exudative angiopathy an increase in the capillary hyperpermeability can precede phases of progression. Cases of primary occlusive angiopathy display a jerky type of involvement of larger and larger retinal vessels. An additional exudative component accelerates progression of the angiopathy. Large zones without visible capillaries or multiple small areas with deficient capillarisation, IRMAs and shunt vessels herald the imminent onset of the proliferative stage (preproliferative stage). The primary exudative types show slow evolution, whilst the primary occlusive types show rapid, phasic progression...</AbstractText>"}

The 'three-in-one concept' for the development of diabetic microangiopathy and a rational approach to its prophylaxis.","Journal":"Acta medica Scandinavica. Supplementum","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Evidence for a causative relationship between prolonged tissue hypoxia and diabetic retinopathy and glomerulosclerosis are presented. Based on the assumption that one of the most fundamental requirements for optimal cellular metabolism is a constant cellular oxygen tension, the 'three-in-one concept' for the development of diabetic microangiopathy is formulated. The term 'three-in-one' is employed because this concept partly or completely includes 'the glycoprotein-', 'the hypoxia-', and 'the growth hormone hypothesis'. Diabetics show evidence of variability in the tissue oxygen availability/demand ratio which is compensated by three self-regulating factors: 1) an increase in local flow, 2) an increase in red cell 2,3-DPG leading to a shift to the right of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, and 3) an increase in the oxygen-binding capacity or the haemoglobin concentration. The level of plasma inorganic phosphate (Pi) is of importance in maintaining high 2,3-DPG levels. However, since Pi fluctuates depending upon changes in the control of diabetes, the regulatory mechanism of the 2,3-DPG modulated unloading of oxygen from the erythrocytes often becomes insufficient, and therefore in poorly regulated diabetics with less than optimal 2,3-DPG levels, the main load of compensation against tissue hypoxia is placed on an adjustment in the microcirculation of the organ involved. However, in order for the microvascular dilatation to occur, the cells must experience a hypoxic stimulus. The summation of the infinite number of discrete and occasionally pronounced hypoxic injuries to the tissue cells in association with the adverse effect of local vasodilatation with increased plasma permeation through the vessel walls might over the years lead to diabetic microangiopathy. Based on this theory the high level of Pi in diabetes becomes of particular significance. Our experience with a high phosphate diabetes diet in the treatment of diabetics is presented. This dietary regimen leads to a significant increase in the oxygen release capacity of the erythrocytes, suggesting an improvement in tissue oxygenation, and may therefore become of value in the prophylaxis of diabetic microangiopathy.</AbstractText>"}

In the bulbar conjenctiva and in the kidney the changes are associated with vascular dysfunction and may be due to autonomic neuropathy. The role of autoregulation in these vascular beds is not clear. In the limb muscles and in the retina the functional abnormality in early diabetes and in those with only mild retinopathy is increased blood flow. This increase in blood flow is probably the result of autoregulatory adaptation to hypoxia induced by 2,3 diphosphoglycerate deficiency. Lactic acid accumulation may also contribute. Breakdown of the autoregulation in the retina results in the development of diabetic retinopathy. The late stages of retinopathy, new vessel formation, are an attempt at revascularisation of areas of capillary non-perfusion.</AbstractText>"}

The overall prevalence (36%) and the age-related characteristics of fasting hypertriglyceridemia were similar to distributions reported in groups of patients with coronary artery disease. Fasting hypercholesterolemia occurred in four patients (2.5%), in three of whom there was evidence of associated hyperchylomicronemia on lipoprotein electrophoresis. For effective application of the OGTT response to the detection of hypertriglyceridemic patients, somewhat lower blood glucose levels than those generally accepted for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus are necessary. Fasting hyperglycemia and the retention of body weight gained after age 25 were features of hypertriglyceridemic patients. Insufficient basal insulin action could explain the development of fasting hypertriglyceridemia in patients in whom the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is being considered.</AbstractText>"}

Nonhormonal immunoreactivity associated with the plasma proteins is eliminated by acetone precipitation before assay, leaving unaltered a component that is immunologically and chromatographically indistinguishable from standard AVP. Storage of plasma results in a decline in AVP concentration and, thus, must be carefully regulated. The plasma AVP values obtained by our method approximate the anticipated levels and vary in accordance with physiologic expections. In recumbent normal subjects, plasma AVP ranged from (mean +/-SD) 5.4+/-3.4 pg/ml after fluid deprivation to 1.4+/-0.8 pg/ml after water loading, and correlated significantly with both plasma osmolality (r=0.52; P&lt;0.001) and urine osmolality (r=0.77; P&lt;0.001). After fluid restriction, plasma AVP was uniformly normal relative to plasma osmolality in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia but was distinctly subnormal in all patients with pituitary diabetes insipidus. The infusion of physiologic amounts of posterior pituitary extract caused a dose-related rise in plasma vasopressin that afterwards declined at the expected rate (t(1/2)=22.5+/-4 min). We conclude that, when used appropriately, our radioimmunoassay method provides a useful way of assessing AVP function in man.</AbstractText>"}

Survival times and glucose and nitrogen excretion were significantly greater in dogs with ligation of the hepatic artery than in dogs with an Eck fistula. The dogs with ligated hepatic arteries also showed a significantly slower rise in plasma ketones. The course of diabetes was compared in three additional groups of partially depancreatized dogs consisting of a) dogs with ligated hepatic arteries, b) dogs with Eck fistulas, and c) controls. Hepatic arterial ischemia: 1) increased survival, without insulin treatment (a--650, b--167, c--124 days) 2) did not decrease tracer-determined rate of glucose production 3) led to a greater urinary excretion of glucose, ketone bodies and nitrogen than portal ischemia. Partially depancreatized dogs with either arterial or portal hepatic ischemia maintained a high rate of glucose disappearance on acute deprivation of endogenous insulin (clamping of vessels of their pancreatic remnant) due probably to decreased insulin degradation by the ischemic liver. The dogs died in coma after losing all fat depots. There was severe fatty change in the livers of dogs with hepatic artery ligation, slight in those with Eck fistulas and no fat in the livers of controls.</AbstractText>"}

Four simulated patients-with diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism with bleeding ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and cancer of the large intestine-tape recorded 20- to 30-second segments on 12 topics pertaining to their illness. Six topics dealt with the patients' physical problems; six with psychological aspects of the problems. In the tests for nurses' willingness both to listen and to pass along information to the next nurse, the 48 tape-recorded segments of patient information were played for 16 volunteer nurses in a laboratory set up for the purpose. Although the nurses had an option of listening or preparing a medication, they were expected to listen to at least 16 of the 48 segments. Following this, they were asked to tape record a report on the patient for the nurse who would follow them. The nurses, on average, listened to 29 of the 48 segments. The diabetic patient was listened to least; the cancer and the colitis patients each received a similar amounts of attention. The nurses gave substantial amounts of information as well as interpretive data about the patients so that the methodology seemed to prove that nurses could become sufficiently involved in a simulated patient setting.</AbstractText>"}

Male patients 30-52 years old suffering from IHD were subdivided into two groups: those in whom IHD was not associated with risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetes or smoking (group I); and those in whom heavy smoking was the only major risk factor recognized (group II). The controls were patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group III). Skin fibroblasts obtained from these patients were cultured and investigated with respect to metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL), synthesis of cellular lipids and induction of cholesterol ester accumulation in the presence of chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal hydrolases. After 24 h incubation, the uptake and degradation of LDL protein in cells from patients of group II was significantly higher than in the controls, group III, but not different from those of group I. Hydrolysis of [3H] cholesterol linoleate, and incorporation of [3H] oleic acid into total lipids and into cholesterol esters was similar in cell cultures of the 3 groups studied. After exposure to chloroquine and LDL, the cells from the different donors accumulated cholesterol ester to a similar extent. Thus, whereas no significant difference was encountered in the lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in cells of patients with IHD without risk factors and controls, some increase in LDL metabolism was seen in cells from patients with IHD and with a history of smoking. It remains to be determined whether this increase was causally related to smoking.</AbstractText>"}

All patients with Lisfranc's fracture-dislocation and without a specific history of acute trauma should be evaluated for the possibility of diabetes mellitus or another cause of sensory neuropathy.</AbstractText>"}

Blood branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels were elevated in diabetic ketosis and decreased in patients with insulinomas. Blood concentrations of BCAA were significantly correlated to blood glucose levels, and in diabetics they were also correlated to blood ketone bodies, serum free fatty acids, and glycerol levels. These data indicate an inverse relationship between circulating effective insulin levels and blood BCAA concentrations. It is suggested that blood levels of BCAA might represent an indicator of insulin-dependent alterations of protein metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

The better therapeutic effect of GCL is obvious as compared with chloropropamide and butyl biguanide, but not so well manifested as with tolbutamide. The therapeutic GCL effect is better in almost all followed up ages, the most advanced incld., which is not cogent for the rest of the oral preparations.

The degree of severity of this disease was classified according to the typing of Liley. There was found an increase of placental weight in relation to the degree of severity of rhesus sensitization. Similar relation was seen referred to the height of the placenta-child-index. Implantation lesions occurred in all degrees of sensitization. In the most cases we found insertion anomalies of the cord or shape abnormalities. All the placentas showed a disturbance of circulation, in 70% only in small areas. A relation to the degree of the severity of this disease wasn't provable. Nearly all placentas showed villi necrosis and proliferation of the syncytiotrophoblast. A compensatory angiomatosis was seen only 3 times. The authors found 85,7% distrubed maturation of the villi in rhesus sensitization; there was a relation between the degree of the changes and the degree of the severity of the disease. Dominant was the discordant retardation of the villi. These pathological findings have to be seen in correlation to the aetiology of this disease, causal treatment is not possible.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover a new 'privileged position' for the islets grafts is proposed and is as uneventful as a liver biopsy. The functional value of this grafting procedure has been assessed on biological and functional criteria. The transplanted islets are easily retrievable and histological and especially immunocytochemical studies demonstrate the morphological behaviour of such islets. Finally the preliminary survival of allogeneic grafts into the liver supports the concept of the role of the liver during enhancement of facilitation and will be the subject of further investigations.</AbstractText>"}

The follow up of the four therapeutical parameters (number of hours, amount of fluids, insulin and KCl necessary for equilibration) showed that this classification of ketoacidosis reflects the degree of metabolic and hydroelectrolytic disorders, suggesting at the same time the intensity of the treatment to be administered in view of correcting them.</AbstractText>"}

In addition to diet 17 patients had basic treatment with sulfonylureas with or without biguanides, one patient was treated with insulin. In all patients carbohydrate metabolism was not well controlled, 14 patients had elevated triglycerides. Following a control period of 2 weeks the patients received increasing doses of MPC in addition to basic treatment (25825825 mg; 50,25,25 mg; 50, 50, 25 mg). Blood samples were taken in the fasting state before the first dose of MPC. Free fatty acids almost doubled under the influence of MPC. This was due to a rebound effect at night following suppression of lipolysis during the day. Blood glucose levels showed a tendency to fall, urinary glucose excretion, separately examined for day and night ,did not change consistently. Triglycerides fell markedly by 25%, but this reduction was not statistically significant. Cholesterol decreased by 5%. 40% of the patients showed an increase in urinary ketone bodies. Body weight did not change. Side effects due to MPC included flushing, gastrointestinal distress and cardiovascular complaints and were observed in 75% of the patients. Due to the high frequency of side effects it does not seem to be worthwhile to further investigate the therapeutic effect of MPC in a larger number of patients with different dosage regimens.</AbstractText>"}

Interaction of insulin and exercise on glucose uptake.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Jan 1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>1. The interaction of insulin and isometric exercise on glucose uptake by skeletal muscle was studied in the isolated perfused rat hindquarter. 2. Insulin, 10 m-i.u./ml, added to the perfusate, increased glucose uptake more than 10-fold, from 0.3-0.5 to 5.2-5.4 mumol/min per 30g of muscle in hindquarters of fed and 48h-starved rats respectively. In contrast, it did not stimulate glucose uptake in hindquarters from rats in diabetic ketoacidosis. 3. In the absence of added insulin, isometric exercise, induced by sciatic-nerve stimulation, increased glucose uptake to 4 and 3.4 mumol/min per 30g of muscle in fed and starved rats respectively. It had a similar effect in rats with moderately severe diabetes, but it did not increase glucose uptake in rats with diabetic ketoacidosis or in hindquarters of fed rats that had been 'washed out' with an insulin-free perfusate. Insulin, at concentrations which did not stimulate glucose uptake in resting muscle, restored the stimulatory effect of exercise in these situations. 4. The stimulation of glucose uptake by exercise was independent of blood flow and the degree of tissue hypoxia; also it could not be reproduced by perfusing resting muscle with a medium previously used in an exercise experiment. 5. At rest glucose was not detectable in muscle cell water of fed and starved rats even when perfused with insulin. In the presence of insulin, a small accumulation of glucose, 0.25 mM, was noted in the muscle of ketoacidotic diabetic rats, suggesting inhibition of glucose phosphorylation, as well as of transport. 6. During exercise, the calculated intracellular concentration of glucose in the contracting muscle increased to 1.1-1.6mM in the fed, starved and moderately diabetic groups. Insulin significantly increased the already high rates of glucose uptake by the hindquarters of these animals but it did not alter the elevated intracellular concentration of glucose. 7. In severely diabetic rats, exercise did not cause glucose to accumulate in the cell in the absence of insulin. In the presence of insulin, it increased glucose uptake to 6.1 mumol/min per 30g of muscle and intracellular glucose to 0.72 mM. 8. The data indicate that the stimulatory effect of exercise on glucose uptake requires the presence of insulin. They suggest that in the absence of insulin, glucose uptake is not enhanced by exercise owing to inhibition of glucose transport into the cell.</AbstractText>"}

Immunological studies indicated that the antibody was a 7S IgG directed against the beta subunit of LH, which is not species-specific. The demonstration of immunoassayable LH in a commercially available pitressin preparation strongly suggests that this patient was immunized by bovine or porcine LH. Although studies of her urinary LH excretion and serum LH (by an interstitial cell bioassay system) suggest that at least some of her endogenous LH is not bound by the antibody, the possibility remains that this type of immunization may have important implications for the development and maintenance of normal adult pituitary-ovarian relationships.</AbstractText>"}

Dietetic candies and cookies contained more calories than the regular ones. These differences were significant only for candies (p less than 0.005). In contrast, dietetic fruits and preserves/syrups had significantly fewer calories than the regular ones (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.005 respectively). Dietetic puddings/gelatins were significantly less expensive and contained fewer calories than the regular products (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.005, respectively). Dietetic ice creams were generally more expensive with varying amounts of carbohydrate content. Most dietetic products contained higher amounts of protein than regular food products. Since the dietetic products constitute only a fraction of total food intake, the differences in their composition have little or no effect on the relationship of nutrients consumed within a 24-hour period. Thus, in most cases the consumer receives little or no nutritional benefit from the higher cost of dietetic products.</AbstractText>"}

Recording of the His potentials showed that the resultant rhythm was of supra-ventricular origin. The absence of mechanical atrial activity was confirmed radiographically, on the jugular venogram, on the apexogram, and on the tracings of right atrial and pulmonary capillary pressure. A search was made for muscular or neuromuscular dystrophy which has often been found in association with this arrhythmia, but none was found. There may be an etio-pathological relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and atrial paralysis, as certain authors have suggested.</AbstractText>"}

The nuclear diameters were measured with an analyzer of particle size--the 'TGZ-3 Zeiss'--, the cut surface of the nuclei was determined and the nuclei categorized accordingly. 1. The normal liver in each age group is characterized by a well-defined nuclear pattern that is specific for this organ. In the 3rd decade nuclei of the main class predominate. In later decades 2 classes of large nuclei gradually appear and reach their mximum after the 50th year. In the 7th decade a reduction of the cut nuclear surface takes place in all the categoreis, presumably determined by a reduction of function. 2. The increase in the number of large nuclei is explained by abortive karyokineses which in the course of the normal turnover of cells ('Zellmauserung'), increasingly replace normal mitoses. This is This is attributed to disturbances of the achromatic apparatus that occur with increasing age. 3. Alcoholic, and even more so diabetic, fatty change leads to the formation of particularly large nuclei. This appears to depend on the volume of the individual fat droplet within the individual cell rather than on the degree of fatty change of the whole liver. 4...</AbstractText>"}

As compared with the control group, it was discovered that there was a sharp increase in mast cells in the group with insular amyloidosis and in the group with diabetes; the number of mast cells tended to increase even more in the presence of both pathological conditions. With these data in hand, it is assumed that the increase in mast cells in the islets of Langerhans is not only due to the presence of amyloidosis, but that it is also brought about as a direct consequence of diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

A, Pathological anatomy and histology","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>30 parotid biopsies of patients with sialadenosis--a symmetrical, painless, non-inflammatory, recurrent parotid swelling--were studied by electron microscopy. The patients suffered from different diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, liver diseases, hypertension and other affections. Parotid biopsies from 25 patients with slight parotitis or with oral cancer were used as controls. Morphometric studies reveal that the parotid swelling is caused by an enlargement of acinar cells. In controls the average diameters of the acinar cells are 30 to 40 mu. In sialadenosis the diameters are enlarged to 50 to 70 mu, in some cases to a maximum of 100 mu. Histologically the cytoplasm of the enlarged acinar cells shows either a granular pattern due to a numerical increase in secretory granules or a vacuolar transformation. Ultrastructurally the vacuolar transformed acinar cells also contain an increased number of granules with less electron density than the surrounding cytoplasm. Three types of sialadenosis can be distinguished with regard to the electron density of the acinar granules: a) a dark granular type, b) a pale granular type and c) a mixed granular type. The mixed granular type probably develops from the dark granular form. Alterations leading to the destruction of the myoepithelial cells were observed in all three types of sialadenosis with minimal changes in the dark granular type. Degenerative alterations of the autonomic nervous system are evident in all three groups with most pronounced changes in the pale granular type of sialadenosis. The ultrastructural alterations are interpreted as a disturbance of secretion, probably primarily caused by the degeneration of the autonomic nervous system. The alteration of the autonomic nervous system is suggested to be the common pathogenetic principle in all types of human sialadenosis occurring with different basic diseases. The enlargement of the acinar cells is the result of an intracellular disturbance in the secretory process due to the preceding defect of the autonomous nerval structures.</AbstractText>"}

Following this the patients were divided into two groups. Group A received Bactrim for three months and Group B received a placebo for three months. Urine cultures were carried out six times during this three month period. In Group A, 13 patients (25%) were infected preoperatively and 9 patients (17%) postoperatively. In group B, 10 patients (22.8%) were infected preoperatively and 9 patients (20.5%) postoperatively. There was no significant difference between the results in the two groups. These and other results allow the following conclusions: 1. Routine postoperative long term treatment with antibacterial substances has no significant effect on the postoperative urinary tract infection. 2. Long term preoperative indwelling catheter treatment increases the incident of postoperative urinary tract infection. This can be prevented by operating patients early following the first urinary retention. It is confirmed that there is an increased risk of persistent urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder disturbances, preoperative ureteral dilatation, diabetes mellitus and various other complications.</AbstractText>"}

Measurements were made in the basal postabsorptive state and during the administration of glucose at a rate of 2 mg/kg per min for 45 min. In the basal state, net splanchnic glucose production did not differ significantly between diabetics and controls. However, splanchnic uptake of alanine and other glycogenic amino acids was 1(1/2)-2 times greater in the diabetics, while lactate and pyruvate uptake was increased by 65-115%. Splanchnic uptake of these glucose precursors could account for 32% of hepatic glucose output in the diabetics, as compared to 20% in the controls. This increase in precursor uptake was a consequence of a two- to threefold increment in fractional extraction of these substrates inasmuch as arterial levels of alanine, glycine, and threonine were reduced in the diabetics, while the levels of the remaining substrates were similar in the two groups. Peripheral output of alanine and other glycogenic amino acids as reflected in arterio-femoral venous differences was similar in both groups. An elevation in arterial valine, leucine, and isoleucine was observed in the diabetics, but could not be accounted for on the basis of alterations in splanchnic or peripheral exchange of these amino acids. Administration of glucose (2 mg/kg per min) for 45 min resulted in an 80% reduction in splanchnic glucose output in controls, but failed to inhibit hepatic glucose release in the diabetics despite a twofold greater increment in arterial glucose levels. In both groups no consistent changes in arterial glucagon were observed during the infusion. It is concluded that in nonketotic diabetics (a) total splanchnic output of glucose is comparable to controls, but the relative contribution of gluconeogenesis may be increased by more than 50%; (b) accelerated splanchnic uptake of glucose precursors is a consequence of increased hepatic extraction of available substrates rather than a result of augmented substrate supply; and (c) the failure of glucose infusion to inhibit hepatic glucose output suggests that the exquisite sensitivity of the liver to the infusion of glucose in normal man is a consequence of glucose-induced insulin secretion.</AbstractText>"}

The mean rise in blood glucose level after the intake of 50 g glucose, was 53% in normal cases, and only 41% in the prediabetic cases, due to increased insulin secretion in the prediabetic group. This group of pregnants gave flat-topped curves in 60% of the cases studied, as compared to 10% of the normal pregnant cases in the same study. This was attributed to delayed insulin secretion in the prediabetic group. On the other hand, all diabetic cases gave peaked glucose tolerance curves during the first hour after glucose intake. The results of insulin-glucose tolerance test, effect of fasting for four hours and tolbutamide sensitivity test suggested that the prediabetic pregnants showed hyperinsulinemia which became evident during fasting. The pancreas of the prediabetic responds more readily, by the release of insulin, to the stimulus of oral hypoglycemic agents, such as sodium tolbutamide, than in the case of normal pregnants. Measurements of serum inorganic phosphorus, serum potassium and serum alkaline phosphatase of these 3 groups of pregnants, showed a definite disturbance in the liver function of the prediabetics which became more obvious in the diabetic group.</AbstractText>"}

What coincidental alterations of the ratio A-cells to B-cells do occur in the islets of Langerhans?</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='MATERIALS AND METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>120 male Wistar rats of averagely 180 g body weight were fed a standard diet ('Rehbrücke') with drinking water ad libitum. After deprivation of food for 15 hours the animals were sacrificed by heart puncture under ether anesthesia. The caudal part of the body was rinsed free from blood by ice-cooled physiological saline via the aorta. After removal of the livers each 2 g of liver tissue were homogenized in 0.25 M saccharose or 70% ethyl alcohol. For the study of impairment of ribonuclease activity in the liver following different lesions the animals were divided into 3 test groups of 35 animals each: group 1: alloxan diabetes; group 2: liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy; group 3: alloxan diabetes in combination with liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. From each group always 4 to 6 animals were sacrificed at the following time intervals: 2nd day and 4th day as well as after 3, 4 and 6 weeks. In 8 animals the enzymatic activity was not influenced. RNA content and dry weight of the livers of all test animals were determined. In liver homogenates with saccharose the ribonuclease activity was measured according to the method of FIERS (1961) using highly purified yeast RNA for substrate. This technique is especially suitable for raw tissue homogenates. After 30 min incubation at 37 degrees C and precipitation of the high-molecular polynucleotides as well as of protein by means of methylglycol and barium perchlorate the not precipitable low-molecular oligonucleotides which were produced by ribonuclease action, were spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatant at 260 nm. The deltaE-value was calculated for the employed quantity of RNA related to mg of protein brought into action. Demonstration and determination of the ribonuclease inhibitor was abandoned. Two different RNA substrate concentrations were used; in the higher concentration the activity was measured at pH 5.5 to 6 and 7.5, in the lower concentrations at pH 7. Protein measurement was performed after the method of LOWREY (LOWREY et al. 1951) as modified by GLASER and KLEINE (1962); blood sugar was determined in tail vein blood by means of o-toluidine technique. In the liver homogenate with ethyl alcohol the RNA extraction was modified according to the data given by OGUR and ROSEN (1950); RNA determination was done colorimetrically using orcin hydrochloric acid. For dry weight determination the same homogenate was used. Alloxan diabetes was induced by injecting the rats 175 mg/kg b.w. of alloxan after fasting for 24 hours. The 5% alloxan solution in citrate buffer (pH = 4) was prepared immediately before injection. For further experimentation only those animals with blood sugar values of greater than 300 mg/100 ml were employed...</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":98675,"Title":"Oral hypoglycemic agent update.","Journal":"The Medical clinics of North America","Date":"Jul 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The treatment of diabetes is still a problem more than a half-century after the discovery of insulin. Patients are now living significantly longer but until the development of oral hypoglycemic agents, the only direct treatment modalities were exercise, diet, and insulin. Before evaluating the effectiveness of treatment, a therapeutic goal must be determined. While there are no absolutely 'hard' facts proving that 'good control' is beneficial in preventing chronic complications of diabetes, increasing accumulation of 'soft' data strongly suggests that normal blood glucose levels are most desirable, when possible, but not at the cost of severe or disabling hypoglycemic reactions. The development of the oral agents was a great public health advance in that many persons with early diabetes, but fearful of insulin injections, had less dread of 'the pills' and sought treatment. The oral agents simplified care but this very simplification process often undermined the need for proper diet and good fundamental care. This often led to mediocre diabetes care. While useful, the oral agents have marked limitations and in some are effective only temporarily. The presently available oral agents are sulfonylureas and require a viable beta-cell system for success. This limits the number of diabetics responsive to such treatment. The general indications for tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, acetohexamide and tolazamide are in maturity-onset diabetics, generally beyond the age of 40 with diabetes of less than 10 years. They are contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetics, in pregnant women, and usually in patients undergoing major surgery, and can become ineffective during periods of extreme stress or during severe infection. They can lower blood glucose levels if used in proper doses in properly selected patients. Contrary to several decades of documentation, it has become popular to suggest that the oral agents are not effective. They can be effective but for many reasons apparently were not in their use by the U.G.D.P. researchers. This might not be the fault of the oral agent used. If ineffective, they should be discontinued. Many, but not all, patients may respond to diet therapy, which is then the treatment of choice. Obviously insulin, though difficult to use for many persons and in itself able to induce several severe reactions if not used properly, is the only treatment (with diet) for the severe diabetic. There is a large spectrum of patients inbetween in whom the oral agents may be useful. The use of phenformin (phenethyl-biguanide) has been effectively curtailed because of many reported cases of lactic acidosis, and while it is doubtful that phenformin alone, in the absence of complicating factors, is the causative factor, it is capable of being an augmenting influence when other conditions, such as decreased kidney function, prevail...</AbstractText>"}

Effect of maternal diabetes on congenital malformations.","Journal":"Birth defects original article series","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The effect of maternal diabetes on the risk of congenital malformations was investigated in 23,695 pregnancies of white mothers, inclucing 339 patients of the Joslin Clinic, and in 24,742 pregnancies of Negro mothers, drawn from the prospective Collaborative Perinatal Project. Of these, 372 mothers had gestational diabetes and 567 had overt diabetes (before and during pregnancy). Pregnancy outcomes studied included stillbirths and live births. Among core women (excluding the Joslin Clinic cases), the frequencies of diabetic pregnancies were 1.31% and 1.18% for white and Negro mothers, respectively; in both groups, approximately two thirds of these pregnancies had gestational diabetes. There was no increase in malformation risk in the pregnancies of mothers with gestational diabetes over that of nondiabetic mothers in either racial group. However, the risk of malformation for white mothers with overt diabetes was double that of nondiabetic mothers for both major and minor categories of malformations. The incidences of major and minor types of malformations in the pregnancies of white mothers with overt diabetes were 17.94% and 10.94%, respectively, compared to the corresponding incidences of 8.34% and 6.25% for the white nondiabetic group. In Negro mothers with overt diabetes, a smaller increase of risk was seen only in major malformations; the incidences were 13.64% and 8.45% for the diabetic and nondiabetic groups, respectively. The increased risks for malformations were distributed generally throughout the organ systems. Multiple malformations occurred more frequently in the overt diabetic than in the nondiabetic group, suggesting that maternal diabetes must act adversely an an early stage of fetal development. Two cases with the caudal regression syndrome were observed in children of diabetic mothers, whereas none was found among births from nondiabetic mothers. Insulin (or analog) therapy of diabetes neither decreased nor increased the risk of malformation in the fetus. However, duration of diabetes had a significant effect on the malformation risk: the longer the mother had the disease, the higher was the incidence of malformations in the fetus. Paternal diabetes did not contribute to increase in risk. These observations suggest that maternal diabetes per se, through its adverse effects on maternal metabolism, is the responsible factor for the increase of malformations in the offspring.</AbstractText>"}

Controlled studies and clinical experience have shown that it possesses anorectic activity at least as good as that of other therapeutically useful drugs of its type, but like these drugs it has only a limited role in the overall management of obesity. Tolerance to the anorectic effects of fenfluramine may possibly develop more slowly than to other chemically related drugs in patients with refractory obesity. The mechanism of its anorectic action is probably by an effect on the appetite control centres in the hypothalamus, rather than by an effect on glucose and lipid metabolism. However, its effect in enhancing glucose uptake into skeletal muscle may be of advantage in diabetes mellitus, preliminary studies suggesting that it is of potential use in maturity-onset obese diabetics who cannot be adequately controlled by dietary measures alone. The starting dosage in obesity of 40mg daily should be increased gradually over 2 to 4 weeks to 60 to 120mg. In general, little extra benefit is gained by higher dosage. When a course of therapy is to be discontinued, fenfluramine dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 2 to 4 weeks in order to avoid mood depression which has occurred in some patients on abrupt withdrawal of the drug. With these recommendations, the majority of patients tolerate fenfluramine satisfactorily, although some patients may have to discontinue the drug because of troublesome gastro-intestinal problems, diarrhoea, drowsiness or dizziness. Unlike other amphetamine-derived anorectics, fenfluramine is not a central stimulant in therapeutic doses, and it probably has little abuse potential.</AbstractText>"}

Being one of the enzymes of the gamma-glutamyl cycle, it is involved in aminoacid transport, catalysing a transpeptidation reaction between gamma-glutamyl peptides and most common amino acids. Methods of assay of the enzyme are based on its ability also to act on synthetic amides of glutamic acid; kinetic methods monitoring the release of p-nitroaniline from the substrate L-gamma-glutamyl p-nitroanilide are the most satisfactory. In diseases of the liver, the highest levels occur in association with cirrhosis, alcoholism, hepatic secondaries and cholestasis. As the enzyme is present in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte, its activity is increased in situations leading to microsomal enzyme induction. Raised levels can also occur in pancreatitis, diabetes, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, chronic renal failure, cerebrovascular accidents, cerebral tumours and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although the lack of specificity must be recognised, the estimation can be useful in the elucidation of some clearly defined problems arising during investigation of patients with suspected hepatic disease, especially where performed as part of a biochemical profile.</AbstractText>"}

These fluctuations of 2,3-DPG are mediated by variations in plasma inorganic phosphate as indicated by a close correlation. While 2,3-DPG was markedly decreased in diabetic ketoacidosis, it tended to be increased in ambulatory, non-acidotic patients. Since in the non-acidotic patients the oxygen-carrying capacity, i.e. the haemoglobin concentration was simultaneously elevated, these findings suggest the presence of relative tissue hypoxia in diabetes. Both in non-acidotic and in ketoacidotic patients there was a strong correlation between the amount of 2,3-DPG and the P50 at actual pH as an experssion of the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin. In order to guarantee an optimal erythrocyte oxygen release in diabetics the content of red cell 2,3-DPG and plasma inorganic phosphate should be higher than normal.</AbstractText>"}

Its relation to the early functional changes in the microcirculation of diabetic subjects.","Journal":"Acta medica Scandinavica. Supplementum","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The underlying cause leading to the reversible functional changes in the microcirculation of insulin-dependent diabetic subjects early during the disease prior to any clinical signs of retinopathy and nephropathy (functional microangiopathy) is discussed. It is suggested that the initial microvascular dilation observed in diabetics is due to an autoregulatory response to relative tissue hypoxia providing an increased tissue perfusion in order to improve tissue oxygen delivery. Supporting evidence for this suggestion is derived from the findings that diabetics simultaneously may show increased tissue oxygen consumption and decreased ability of the circulating blood to release oxygen to the tissues. The latter defect is likely to be caused by two interrelated factors: 1. an increased proportion of haemoglobin A1c with high oxygen affinity, and 2. difficulties of maintaining a sufficiently high concentration of plasma inorganic phosphate in order to provide an optimal 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) content in the erythrocytes. The basal oxygen demand of diabetics may fluctuate even within a few hours dependent upon the state of metabolic control and is increased at times of poor regulation. Hence, diabetics may suffer from innumerable cellular hypoxic injuries, which during the first years of the disease are counteracted in the microcirculation by an autoregulatory response. These microvascular reactions associated with increased plasma permeation may over the years be of major importance for the development of the degenerative microangiopathy in diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The development of inhibitors of the aldose reductase enzyme affords new means for preventing and treating some of these complications. Nevertheless, we are still hampered by the lack of knowledge of the normal role of this pathway in tissue metabolism. Many technical problems still exist concerning sensitive and specific assays for the products of the sorbitol pathway in tissue studies, as well as with valid techniques for the measuremtn of the activity of this pathway in clinical situations.

Simultaneously, the acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and inulin clearance rates were measured, and acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate reabsorption rates were calculated. Renal clearance of blood acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate remained constant. In contrast, acetoacetate reabsorption rate increased significantly from 47 plus or minus 10 mumoles/min on day 3 to 106 plus or minus 15, 89 plus or minus 10, and 96 plus or minus 10 mumoles/min on days 10, 17, and 24, respectively. Similarly, beta-hydroxybutyrate reabsorption rate increased significantly from 154 plus or minus 27 mumoles/min on day 3 to 419 plus or minus 53, 399 plus or minus 25, and 436 plus or minus 53 mumoles/min on days 10, 17, and 24, respectively. Both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate reabsorption rates increased linearly when plotted against their filtered loads. Thus, no tubular maximal transport rate exists for acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate during physiologic ketonemia. Conservation 450-500 mmoles of ketone bodies/day prevents large urinary losses of cations during prolonged starvation. Since ammonium becomes the major cation excreted during prolonged fasting, the increased renal reabsorption of ketone bodies minimizes body protein loss and aids in maintaining high circulating acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations.</AbstractText>"}

Monographia","Date":"1975","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The author of the present study examined electric activity of the muscle in three types of chronic arterial occlusions, i.e. in obliterating atherosclerosis, obliterating thromboangiitis and diabetic angiopathy. He obtained two different electromyographic patterns. One, present in patients suffering from obliterating atherosclerosis, showed signs of a peripheral nerve-damage (characterized by broad action-potentials) and another, found in patients with obliterating thromboangiitis and in diabetics suffering from diabetic angiopathy, with a pattern corresponding to a combined injury--of impaired muscle-fibre and peripheral nerve (characterized by pathological action-potentials of short and long duration). The last group could be further divided into a subgroup where both electromyographic lesions were distinctly noted, comprising patients with obliterating thromboangiitis, and another subgroup, clearly characterized by primary myogenic disorder with a milder disturbance of peripheral nerves. The last subgroup consisted of diabetic patients suffering from diabetic angiopathy. According to the author's suggestion, the divergence in electromyographic patterns in individual diseases of peripheral arteries may be conditioned by different in individual diseases of peripheral arteries, may be conditioned by different localisations of arterial occlusions. Various preferential levels of arterial occlusions give to various diseases a different clinical, as well as electromyographical feature. Neurogenic findings in obliterating atherosclerosis is determined by occlusions of large arteries. From these vessels afferent branches divert for the nutritive supply of the nerve-trunk of the leg. This results in ischaemic lesions of nervous fibers of various degrees in the leg. In the periphery a total of fine or gross changes may be registered on the electomyogram--as a sign of a peripheral nervous lesion. Electromyographic pattern of obliterating thromboangiitis reveals changes similar to those of obliterating atherosclerosis--namely a picture of a peripheral nervous lesion--but in addition there appear regular changes indicating a primarilly muscle impairment. The interpretation means that nervous impairment is present. In fact, no occlusions of the main arteries take place at the level of the diverted nutrient branches of the nerve-trunk, but obliterating thromboangiitis, affecting small and medium vessels, presses the occlusions more proximally to the nervous trunk. The final result and effect is the same and in more severe instances even more striking. Nutrient muscle-arteries, being vessels of medium caliber, are obturated--in cases of obliterating thromboangiitis--commonly with main trunks in the tibial and foot-zone. Possibilities of a collateral circulation in instances where medium and small arteries are obturated, are worse than in large artery-occlusions and the blood-flow becomes more impaired. Realizing the adjacent diffuse affection of arteriolar muscle-net, we get a picture described by Scalabrino and Bianchi...</AbstractText>"}

It is our tentative impression that in psychogenic impotence nocturnal REM erection may be normal in amount and degree and an excellent indicator of erectile potential. In these cases a marked discrepancy exists between the amount and degree of nocturnal erection and the patient's daytime performance level attained during attempted coitus or masturbation. In the organic patients, on the contrary, such a discrepancy does not exist; instead, the maximal nocturnal erection attained corresponds closely to and mirrors the patient's impaired waking performance. This new method may be very useful in the diagnosis, prognosis, and decision as to type of treatment, especially in difficult cases.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":97354,"Title":"Contribution of omega-oxidation to fatty acid oxidation by liver of rat and monkey.","Journal":"Journal of lipid research","Date":"Jul 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Contributions of omega-oxidation to overall fatty acid oxidation in slices from livers of ketotic alloxan diabetic rats and of fasted monkeys are estimated. Estimates are made from a comparison of the distribution of 14C in glucose formed by the slices from omega-14C-labeled compared to 2-14C-labeled fatty acids of even numbers of carbon atoms and from [1-14C]acetate compared to [2-14C]acetate. These estimates are based on the fact that 1) the dicarboxylic acid formed via omega-oxidation of a omega-14C-labeled fatty acid will yield [1-14C]acetate and [1-14C]succinate on subsequent beta-oxidation, if beta-oxidation is assumed to proceed to completion; 2) only [2-14C]acetate will be formed if the fatty acid is metabolized solely via beta-oxidation; and 3) 14C from [1-14C]acetate and [1-14C]succinate is incorporated into carbons 3 and 4 of glucose and 14C from [2-14C]acetate is incorporated into all six carbons of glucose. From the distributions found, the contribution of omega-oxidation to the initial oxidation of palmitate by liver slices is estimated to between 8% and 11%, and the oxidation of laurate between 17% and 21%. Distributions of 14C in glucose formed from 14C-labeled palmitate infused into fasted and diabetic rats do not permit quantitative estimation of the contribution of omega-oxidation to fatty acid oxidation in vivo. However, the distributions found also indicate that, of the fatty acid metabolized by the whole animal in the environment of glucose formation, at most, only a minor portion is initially oxidized via omega-oxidation. As such, omega-oxidation cannot contribute more than a small extent to the formation of glucose.</AbstractText>"}

The results can be summarized as 1) there was no significant difference between the observed 24 hr chromium excretion and 24 hr excretion calculated from the one 4 hr samples, 2) a diurnal variation was observed when urinary excretion was expressed as chromium per minute, but no time-related variation could be established when chromium/creatinine (Cr/Cre) ratios in samples from three different periods of the same day were compared, although a significant positive correlation existed between urinary chromium and creatinine concentration, 3) the Cr/Cre ratio was found to be age-dependent, 4) in malnourished children the Cr/Cre ratio was very high and significantly different from that of normal infants, 5) This ratio for the eight diabetics was found to be significantly higher when compared with normal adults. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that morning 4 hr urinary chromium reflects the daily chromium excretion and that the Cr/Cre ratio of single urine samples obtained during this period is a reliable criterion in the evaluation of chromium nutrition of individuals in different conditions, provided that the influence of age is taken into consideration.</AbstractText>"}

It is an acute infection of the gallbladder caused by a specific group of bacteria that may be aided by some aspect of local ischemia. Cholelithiasis does not seem to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of emphysematous cholecystitis, and this, in association with some dependence upon ischemia, may account for the predominance of this disease in males rather than females. Gangrene is a common feature of the pathologic process, and thus it is not surprising that the diagnosis of emphysematous cholecystitis implies a risk of gallbladder perforation that is five times that expected from ordinary acute cholecystitis. The key to identifying this disease is the plain abdominal roentgenogram which in most instances will make the diagnosis and provide an impetus for early operative intervention.</AbstractText>"}

Estrogens in hamsters usually produce intermediate lobe tumors of the pituitary associated with hypothalamic degeneration. Sex hormone-secreting adrenal tumors can follow surgical gonadectomy in mice. Spontaneous corticoid-secreting adrenal tumors may occur spontaneously in Osborne-Mendel rats. Secretory gonadal tumors have been induced by transplantation of a gonad into the spleen of a gonadectomized host. Both secretory and non-secretory ovarian tumors can be produced by irradiation or chemical carcinogens in mice. In some mice, secretory testicular tumors can be produced by estrogen administration. Thyroid tumors can be induced in rodents by various kinds of goitrogens and irradiation. Parathyroid hyperplasia may occur with spontaneous renal disease in rats.

Serine-synthesizing activity was found to be distributed in various rat tissues such as kidney, brain, testis, spleen, pancreas, and fat pad. However, only in the liver was the synthesis regulated by dietary protein. In the liver, the three enzymes of the phosphorylated pathway were found to be repressed by high-protein diets or by starvation and induced by low-protein diets. The dietary induction of the enzymes required the presence of insulin and was suppressed by glucocorticoids.

These seasonal variations in mortality are seen in infants under 1 year of age and in older people but not in youths and young adults. The amplitude of the seasonal variation in mortality increases with increasing age because of the higher incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in older people. Seasonal variations in air temperature are a more important determinant of seasonal variations in respiratory and cardiovascular deaths than are fluctuations in air pollution; there is usually a time-lag of up to a week in the change in air temperature before the mortality rate for these diseases increases; a run of 4 - 5 days of stressful temperatures (either hot or cold) has more effect on mortality than an isolated hot or cold day. Examination of the seasonal variations in all causes of death of the four population groups in South Africa shows that Whites and Asians display the typical pattern of a winter high and a summer low mortality of populations in developed countries. The seasonal variation in mortality of Coloureds and Blacks is quite different. It shows two peaks, one in winter and one in summer. This bimodal pattern in the seasonal variation is due to the fact that one-third of all Coloured and Black deaths occur in infants under 1 year of age and most of these deaths occur in summer as a result of gastro-enteritis. Comparison was made of the seasonal variations in mortality rates for all causes of death and for respiratory and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) deaths of Whites over 40 years of age in Durban and Johannesburg. This showed that the seasonal variation for all causes of death is greater in Johannesburg than in Durban, i.e. proportionately more older Whites die during winter in Johannesburg than in Durban. The reason for this difference is that the seasonal variation in respiratory disease mortality is much greater in Johannesburg than it is in Durban, but the seasonal variation in IHD mortality is the same in the two cities.</AbstractText>"}

Besides measurement of glucose tolerance one hour after the ingestion of 100 g glucose the following parameters were analyzed: cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid and blood pressure. Male persons had a slightly decreased glucose tolerance; a distinct relationship with age was found in both sexes. After elimination of volunteers in whom pathological results were obtained with respect to other examined parameters, a significantly greater glucose tolerance was found in the remaining 'normal' group. There are no parameters which are closely correlated with glucose tolerance although it was possible to reject the null-hypothesis in several cases due to the large sample involved. For statistical reasons (test sensitivity, test specificity, prevalence of disease) single glucose-tolerance measurements do not give enough evidence for diagnosing diabetes mellitus. Depending on the aims of the screening program one has to define the detection limits as well as frequency of retesting.</AbstractText>"}

A distinct tendency was observed in Group II cases towards a shorter duration of diabetes prior to the manifestation of retinopathy, i.e. less than ten years. The pre-proliferative phase of the retinopathy is similar in duration and manifestation in both groups. There is no difference in the ophthalmoscopic findings or development of proliferative retinopathy either, except that its course is more aggressive in Group I, in contrast to the slower course with longer remissions seen in Group II cases. Thus, the basic characteristics of proliferative retinopathy appear to be independent of the form of diabetes, in keeping with the concept of diabetes mellitus as a single disease entity.</AbstractText>"}

Occurence of acute respiratory illness was ascertained weekly by telephone and calculated as an annual rate. Persons with chronic bronchitis not only experienced more acute lower respiratory illness than healthy comparison subjects, but total illness rates were somewhat higher as well. Infection rates were determined from blood samples taken 3 times from each participant during the surveillance year. Antibody tests were performed for respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza types A and B, coronavirus OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Differences in serologic infection rates among the subgroups of the population were similar to those seen in the clinical data, with more frequent infection among those with bronchitis than among the comparison subjects. This finding indicates that some degree of increased susceptibility to actual infection existed among those individuals with bronchitis. Influence of smoking on illness and infection rates was also examined. Infections were, in general, more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but illness rates were reversed, suggesting that perception of disease differed in the 2 groups. Rates of illness and infection of other adults in the families of the index individuals with bronchitis were not influenced by the higher rates seen in the index individuals; however, it was of interest that children of persons with bronchitis did have somewhat higher rates of infection than children of comparison subjects.</AbstractText>"}

During recent years a host of additional diseases traditionally thought to have some genetic predisposition but with obscure etiology have been suspected of being autoimmune in nature. Rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, myasthenia gravis and thyroiditis are diseases of widely divergent organ systems, yet may well have common pathways of pathology via immune complexing mechanisms. Herein we present evidence supporting the concept that renal artery stenosis (occurring primarily in association with the middle aortic syndrome or after renal transplantation) is of immune etiology. Although the specific antigenic agent is still to be defined there is growing acceptance of the theory that medium and large vessels are subject to autoimmune vasculitis in many aspects similar to the autoimmune affections of small vessels. Several cases are presented. Some of these suggest an immune reaction by the natural history but without evidence of immunochemical reactants in the involved vessels, presumably because active disease was arrested at the time to study. In other cases immunofluorescent preparations demonstrate reactants in the walls of the vessels to document the hypothesis more convincingly.</AbstractText>"}

The study population consisted of 46,689 single and multiple live births and fetal deaths about whom complete information was available on all study variables. Included in the analysis were 5 general malformation categories, 27 specific major, and 7 specific minor malformations. Several new associations were detected between epidemiologic factors and risks of specific malformations while other previously reported associations were confirmed by the present investigation. The analysis of general categories of malformations showed that multiple births had a higher frequency of major malformations than single births; whenever sex differences in incidence were noted, males, with few exceptions, had an excess of malformations over females; and maternal diabetes during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of major malformations in the fetus. Among specific findings of possible etiologic significance were that the risk for microcephaly was associated with infrequent prenatal visits and the presence of maternal hyperthyroidism; and unusually low weight gain and infrequent prenatal visits were associated with increased risk for lung hypoplasia. There was no significant effect of inbreeding of the fetus or mother on the risks of general or specific types of malformations. Anencephaly was more frequent among white than among Negro infants, whereas no difference in incidence was noted in spina bifida between the two racial groups. This finding points to an inconsistency in the hypothesis of common etiology for these malformations. Whites were also found to have significantly higher incidences over Negroes of pyloric stenosis, congenital dislocation of the hip, micrognathia, and pectus excavatum, while Negroes have higher incidences of metatarsus varus and inguinal hernia.</AbstractText>"}

During modest hyperglycemia of about 130 mg/100 ml, induced by glucose infusion, the infusion of secretin at the same rate elicited even more dramatic suppression of pancreaticoduodenal glucagon levels to virtually unmeasurable concentrations. At a lower rate of infusion (5 U priming injection followed by 1 U/min for 20 min) significant suppression of glucagon secretion during hyperglycemia was also observed. Stimulation of endogenous secretin release by the intraduodenal administration of 14 mEq of HCl in 10 dogs during intravenous glucose infusion was followed by a decline in pancreaticoduodenal vein glucagon from 130 pg/ml (SEM+/-34) to a nadir of 99 pg/ml (SEM+/-32) 5 min later (P &lt; 0.05). The infusion of secretin at a rate of 10 U/min in alloxan-diabetic dogs was associated with a significant decline in peripheral venous plasma glucagon, from a mean preinfusion level of 272 pg/ml (SEM+/-39) to a nadir of 128 pg/ml (SEM+/-22) (P &lt; 0.01). It was concluded that exogenous secretin in the doses employed in this study is a potent suppressor of glucagon secretion, particularly during hyperglycemia. HCl-stimulated endogenous secretin also suppresses glucagon secretion. The ability of secretin to augment the glucagon-suppressing effect of ingested glucose qualifies it uniquely for a physiologic role as a modifier of the islet cell response to ingested glucose. The fact that it lowers the hyperglucagonemia of alloxan-diabetic dogs suggests that its glucagon-suppressing activity may not be insulin dependent.</AbstractText>"}

One pool is a readily available small storage pool which is refilled by a second, larger, more slowly responding pool that controls basal and steady-state insulin output. The identical protocol was employed to evaluate the insulin responses in 13 nonobese diabetic subjects. DIABETICS HAD BASAL INSULIN LEVELS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM NORMALS (DIABETICS: 10.7+/-4; normals: 10.7+/-5, mean +/-SD, muU/ml), but had significantly elevated basal glucose levels (diabetics: 161+/-27; normals: 88+/-7, mg/100 ml, P &lt; 0.05). The mean early insulin response (3-5 min Delta IRI) after a 5 g glucose pulse (P1) was significantly diminished in diabetics (diabetics 6.4+/-9; normals: 32.5+/-14, muU/ml, P &lt; 0.01) consistent with a defective storage pool output. The glucose disappearance rate, K(G), decreased in parallel with the early insulin response and the slope of the regression line between these two variables was virtually identical with that calculated from 16 normal subjects. Similar to normal subjects, during the short glucose infusion, the acute insulin response to P2 was diminished in diabetics (P &lt; 0.02). In normal subjects after 20 hr of infusion, the rapid insulin responses to P3 are restored to the preinfusion P1 values, and 1 hr after the infusion was stopped, the responses to P4 are increased twofold (P &lt; 0.001). Diabetics, however, demonstrated decreased early responses to P3 (P &lt; 0.001) and no increased response to P4. In contrast to the diminished acute insulin responses to glucose pulses, diabetics have steady-state insulin levels after 20 hr of glucose infusion similar to those of normal subjects (diabetics: 25.7+/-13; normals: 32.5+/-14, muU/ml). Thus both basal and steady-state insulin levels of diabetics were comparable with those of normal subjects, which suggest that although the rapid insulin response from the storage pool output is defective in diabetics, the more slowly responding pool is intact.</AbstractText>"}

Control experiments were performed in 14 normal dogs. In addition to the acetoacetate-(14)C, the latter were infused at a constant rate with varying amounts of unlabeled acetoacetate so as to obtain a range of ketone transport (26-65 mumoles/min.kg) comparable with that observed in the diabetic dogs (21-41 mumoles/min.kg). The specific activities of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate in blood became equal during the infusion of labeled acetoacetate, indicating that the net transport of acetoacetate represents that of total ketones. In each group, the concentration of ketones was an exponential function of the rate of transport, but for any value below 30 mumoles/min.kg, ketone concentration in the diabetic dogs was about 3 times that in normal dogs, indicating an impairment of mechanisms for utilizing ketones in insulin deficient animals. Maximal capacity to utilize ketones in diabetic dogs was slightly more than half that of normal ones. A similar fraction (32-63%) of the infused (14)C appeared in respiratory CO(2) in the two groups and was independent of the rate of transport. In seven of the normal dogs, administration of insulin and glucose increased removal of the infused ketones and increased the fraction of (14)C appearing in respiratory CO(2). These results demonstrate that utilization of ketones in extrahepatic tissues is influenced by insulin; impaired utilization contributes to diabetic ketosis and is probably essential to the production of severe ketoacidosis.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetes reduced the retention of 3H-testosterone in the prostate, the preputial gland and the epididymis. Exogenous insulin slightly increased the retention of 3H-testosterone in these tissues of diabetic rats. No significant differences in the radioactivity in the rectus abdominis muscle, the coagulating glands and the seminal vesicles were found between the various experimental groups. Ventral prostate homogenates obtained from diabetic and control rats were incubated with 3H-testosterone in vitro. The steroids were extracted and thin-layer chromatographs were scanned for radioactivity. In prostatic homogenates taken from diabetic rats, testosterone transformation to dihydrotestosterone was reduced. The results indicate that the impaired function and androgen retention of the accessory sex glands of diabetic male rats is at least partly due to the reduced formation of dihydrotestosterone from testosterone.</AbstractText>"}

The diabetes was allowed to stabilize for at least 15 days, whereafter the testicular and seminal vesicle histology was studied at various time intervals. Reduction in testis weights and tubule diameters was significant after 2 weeks of diabetes. The changes in seminiferous tubules ranged from premature sloughing of epithelium to total cessation of spermatogenesis. The testicular histology of diabetic animals frequently greatly simulated the situation described following hypophysectomy. By subjective visual assessment the number of Leydig cells was found to be normal or reduced in all of the diabetic animals. Diabetes was also demonstrated to induce seminal vesicle atrophy, which did not show any correlation with the degree of testicular lesions. The possible etiology of testicular damage in diabetic animals is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Groups of control and streptozotocin-treated animals were sacrificed at daily intervals for 4 days after injection. Over this period, treated rats lost weight continuously while control animals progressively gained weight. Within 24 h of treatment blood glucose and plasma free fatty acids were raised to levels which were sustained for the remainder of the experiment. After 48 h blood ketone bodies, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were maximally raised and liver glycogen and blood lactate similarly lowered. The percentage composition of major fatty acids in liver lipids was unchanged until 4 days after treatment when there were significant increases in the proportion of oleate and linoleate and reductions in stearate and arachidonate. The data confirm that streptozotocin induces a rapid and sustained diabetes. It is suggested that metabolic experiments, in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, may be performed 48 h after treatment.</AbstractText>"}

The steady-state levels of glibornuride (maximum and minimum concentrations) were determined experimentally and by calculation (using the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained following oral administration of 50 mg glibornuride on the 1st day of the treatment). There was good agreement between experimental and calculated values. The results afford evidence for the regular pharmacokinetic pattern of glibornuride. There was neither unexpected accumulation of the drug nor diminution of the steady-state levels as might occur as a consequence of induction of microsomal enzymes.</AbstractText>"}

The long-term prognosis for 214 patients discharged alive from hospital after the acute phase of the stroke is presented. The clinical and laboratory findings for 114 patients alive at the time of a follow-up examination 32 months after the stroke are discussed. The long-term prognosis could be predicted best by a score, calculated from the neurological findings on admission after the acute stroke. Recurrence of stroke was associated with a very high mortality. Forty-five per cent of the patients who survived the first month had died by the time of follow-up. About 15% were able to return to normal life or go back to work. There was a trend among patients originally severely handicapped to improve their performance ability. Factors influencing the chances for rehabilitation are discussed. Among the survivors there was a strikingly high percentage of patients with overt diabetes or decreased glucose tolerance, of patients with arteriosclerotic heart disease and patients with elevated serum triglyceride levels. These findings are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Lysine vasopressin (LVP) in the same dose produced a less potent antidiuresis which lasted for only three to four hours. The plasma half life of DDAVP was 7.8 and 75.5 min for the fast and slow phases, compared with 2.5 and 14.5 min for LVP. Radioiodine-labelled DDAVP was not destroyed by incubation with late pregnancy plasma, which contains an enzyme that inactivates vasopressin. The slow metabolic clearance of DDAVP, its absorption through the nasal mucosa, and its lack of side effects make this the ideal drug for the treatment of vasopressin-sensitive diabetes insipidus. Patients usually require 10 to 20 mug DDAVP given intranasally twice daily for good clinical control of their diabetes insipidus.</AbstractText>"}

Circulating IgG-antibodies formed in 39 out of 40 subjects during the observation period of more than 2 years. Insulin binding-capacities below 2 mU/ml (mean value after 12 months: 0.45 mU/ml) were found following MC and considerably higher concentrations (mean value after 12 months: 5.16 mU/ml) following CS administration. However, only 52% of the CS-group (n = 11) showed high individual responses (subgroup II), many of which exceeded 5 mU/ml, while the other half (subgroup I) exhibited values as low as those in the MC-subjects. The ratio of girls to boys was high (8 vs 3) in subgroup II, and low (2 vs 8) in subgroup I. Despite great differences in antibody formation, no differences in insulin requirements were noted between the MC- and the CS-groups. Within the CS-group, however, some positive relationship between these parameters was found 6 months and 12 months after the start of therapy, but this did not necessarily apply to individual subjects. Short-term (metabolic control) and long-term effects of therapy (growth) were not different in the MC- and CS-subjects. From these results it may be concluded that antibody formation does not affect insulin requirements or metabolic control during relatively short-term treatment. Provided that antibodies have no direct relation to future vascular changes, both insulin preparations used in this study are equally well-situated for long-term treatment in children and adolescents.</AbstractText>"}

E4 exhibits a remarkable increase during the latter half of pregnancy. At term, the mean E4-U level in maternal peripheral plasma was 0.67 +/- 0.33 ng/ml, a five fold increase from that at 28 weeks; E4-G was 4.57 +/- 2.84 ng/ml, showing a four fold increase; and E4-G levels in maternal urine were 1.68 +/- 0.96 mg/day, showing a three fold increase from that at 28 weeks. E4-U and E4-G levels showed no diurnal change. The coefficient of the correlation between plasma E4-U and E4-G was 0.699, which is satisfactory, but no correlation was found between urinary and plasma E4 levels. A significant correlation was shown between maternal and umbilical E4-U (r=0.820) and E4-G (r=0.608). No relationships between E4 levels and birth weight were detected. Pre-eclampsia, Rh-isoimmunization and diabetes mellitus are common complications of pregnancy which may cause latent fetal distress. Prenatal fetal assessment was performed by serial daily evaluations of these E4 values. In pre-eclampsia resulting in a small full term baby, E4 levels were mostly below normal mean values or failed to show an increased pattern. In addition, the E4 levels decreased in one case of neonatal death. In Rh-isoimmunization, plasma E4-G levels were lower in the group affected severely by the hemolytic desease. In a patient with diabetes mellitus delivered of a healthy baby, E4 levels were within the range of a normal pregnancy. In order to evaluate fetal and placental reserve capacities as well as feto-placental function, the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHA-S) loading test was performed by loading selected subjects with 50 mg of DHA-S, then serially measuring the E4 in the maternal plasma and urine. Intravenous infusion of 50 mg of DHA-S was completed in 60 minutes. A rapid and sharp increase of plasma E4 was observed, reaching maximal concentrations at 120 minutes in normal pregnancies. However, urinary levels showed patterns similar to those reported for estriol (E3). In some abnormal pregnancies, no increased or delayed patterns were observed in plasma E4-G levels, while the serial levels remained within the normal range. This possibly suggests that in these pregnancies, fetal functions had been inhibited or had reached their limit. It is concluded that the simultaneous determinations of serial E4 levels accompanied by the DHA-S loading test may be of value in assessing fetal well-being and reserve capacity and may therefore improve fetal and neonatal prognosis in abnormal pregnancies.</AbstractText>"}

After 5 years or more 17 of the patients with renal diabetes were located. In only one case had the development of chemical diabetes led to correction of the initial diagnosis to that of potential diabetes with a reduced renal glucose threshold. Family histories of diabetes were identical in both groups (renal and chemical diabetes) (35 %) and did not provide any means for distinguishing renal diabetes from diabetes mellitus with a reduced renal glucose threshold. Amongst the 34 subjects with chemical diabetes who were located, 3 had become frank diabetics (9 %). Chemical diabetes persisted in 14 patients (42 %) and 17 (50 %) could be considered to be normal. In addition to the three subjects with frank diabetes, only 9 patients (5 with chemical diabetes and 4 normal) continued to take oral therapy at the time of the final examination. However, 13 of these patients who were not taking any treatment had abandoned it relatively recently. Even if the effectiveness of oral therapy is not fully clear, it should be remembered that continued treatment renders the patient less neglectful as far as diet is concerned. Tests for microangiopathy in the three diabetic patients were negative.</AbstractText>"}

Risk factors associated with significantly increased reinfarction rates included preoperative hypertension, intraoperative hypotensive episodes, and noncardiac thoracic or upper abdominal operations of more than three hours' duration. Time under anesthesia was strikingly correlated with reinfarction rates in the entire group. Postoperative intensive care unit admission did not significantly affect the reinfarction rate, nor did diabetes, angina, patient age or sex, or site of the previous myocardial infarction.</AbstractText>"}

In normal rats, whose nutritional state varied at the time of adrenaline administration (after a 24 hours' fast, fed ad libitum or given 5 g glucose/kg as a 20% solution intragastrically 2 hours before injecting adrenaline), no marked post-adrenaline differences were found between the size of the decrease in the amount of glycogen in white and red muscle. In addition, no significant differences were found between the three groups of animals in glycogen concentration in the EDL (0.3+/-0.05, 0.35+/-0.03 and 0.26+/-0.02 mg/g) or in the SOL, apart from one exception (0.23+/-0.02, 0.2+/-0.01, and 0.51+/-0.03 mg/g), after adrenaline. The glycogen concentration in the white and red muscle of diabetic rats fed ad libitum fell to values similar to those in normal rats after adrenaline (0.32+/-0.05 mg/g in the EDL and 0.18+/-0.02 mg/g in the SOL). These results supoort the view of authors who hold that glycogenolysis is possible without pre-activation of phosphorylase; they also support the idea, expressed by Krebs, of the existence of a reciprocal relationship between phosphorylase activity and the glycogen concentration, according to which glycogen itself may influence its own degradation.</AbstractText>"}

Perinatal mortality of progeny of mothers suffering from diabetes mellitus may be caused both by embryopathy and antenatal fetopathy. The authors did not observe diabetic gameto- and blastopathies and no indications to their existance was found in literature, although some investigators admit the possibility of genetic implication in the pathology of progeny of parents with diabetes mellitus. In the progeny of mothers suffering from diabetes mellitus among congenital malformations which allow further intrauterine development and even extrauterine life, according to literature data most often there were observed malformations of the skeleton (37%), cardiovascular system malformations (24%) and those of the nervous system (14%). In all observations of the authors there were found congenital malformations of the bone system not infrequently in combination with other congenital defects. The main features of diabetic fetopathy appear in the last third of pregnancy, and therefore it may be considered as late antenatal fetopathy. The term 'diabetic children' applied by some authors to children with diabetic fetopathy should be avoided since it may be erroneously understood as diabetes mellitus. In the majority of cases quite different mechanisms underlie these conditions: hypofunction of the islet apparatus of the pancreas in diabetes mellitus, and its hypofunction in diabetic fetopathy. Diagnosis of diabetic feto- and embryopathies is always based on both clinical and morphological data.</AbstractText>"}

Male Wistar rats were made severly diabetic by the intravenous injection of streptozotocin, 150 mg/kg, and maintained on insulin for 7 days. Insulin was then withheld, and measurememts of whole blood and plasma amino acid concentrations were made at 24-h intervals until 120 h, by which time animal mortality was 80%. Alanine and the other gluogenic amino acids displayed a biphasic response to insulin deprivation, decreasing in plasma and whole blood until 72 h after the last insulin injection then increasing in concentration until 120 h. The branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine remained constant until 72 h after insulin, after which time their concentrations increased dramatically. It was concluded that the first phase represented enhanced gluconeogenesis and in the second phase amino acid uptake for gluconeogenesis was exceeded by net peripheral amino acid release. Enzymatic measurements showed a progressive increase in erythrocyte;plasma distribution ratios for glutamate in ketoacidosis.</AbstractText>"}

In uncontrolled diabetics and patients with hyperthyroidism the mean value of glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), glutathione reductase (GR) was increased, whereas these enzyme activities were reduced in patients with hypoglycemia. Apart from a few values of hexokinase (HK) which were lower than normal the results in hyperlipoproteinemia patients remained essentially unchanged, including the intermediates such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced glutathione (GSH).

Both of them show similar sensitivity to androgens (0.1 mg/rat/day of testosterone being effective) and to antiandrogen administration. However, they differ because of the pattern of glycogen increase (early after the androgen injection in the perineal muscles; slowly and with a linear function of time in the skeletal muscles), and because of the different sensitivities to adrenolectomy, diabetes and hypophysectomy. Also, the biochemical changes induced by testosterone in muscles differ. The rate of sugar uptake and phosphorylation is increased in the perineal muscle only; the rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen is increased in the perineal but depressed in the skeletal muscles. Therefore, in the former case glycogen accumulation depends mainly on increased synthesis; in the latter, it is probably the result of a glycogen sparing effect.</AbstractText>"}

It was possible to increase the number of islets obtained with this procedure by modifying it in several ways. The islets were then transplanted in an isologue manner into rats with streptocotocin-induced diabetes. The effect of transplantation on glucose metabolism in these rats was evaluated both by determination of the general symptoms typical for diabetes as well as by the performance of such functional tests as IVGTT, GAC and tolbutamide test. The islets could be transplanted into various locations, but it was found that positive results were obtained only if the liver was the site of application and if than 2100 islets were used. Three hours after transplantation normalization of blood sugar levels and serum insulin could be observed; these levels remained stable over 18 months. It was possible to transplant in the same animal several times. This had an effect on the metabolism which was equivalent to the sum of the separate transplants. By means of both light and electron microscope examination the morphological changes which the transplanted islets underwent at the site of transplantation were observed.</AbstractText>"}

The frequence of arrhythmias is higher, especially in serious or mortal arrhythmias. Possible pathogenetic reasons for this are briefly discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Ten of the adenomas were solitary, while 3 small adenomas were observed in a single case. Another four possible solitary adenomas were observed, but their identity was uncertain owing to marked fibrosis. All the adenomas contained A-2 (A)-1 cells but no B (B)-1 cells. Nine of them also contained A-1 (D)-1 cells. The majority of cells in the adenomas were A-2 cells or cells which did not stain with any of the techniques used. The 4 possible adenomas contained islet cells (A-1, A-2, B) in different proportions. With one exception the patients with adenomas and possible adenomas were 65 years of age or older, and in some of these cases adenomas or hyperplasias were also found in other endocrine organs. The frequency of gastroduodenal ulcers or scars in the cases with adenoma or possible adenoma did not differ notably from that found in the cases without pancreatic adenomas. Among the cases with pancreatic adenoma and possible adenoma there were 3 patients with maturity onset diabetes mellitus, but otherwise no clinical symptoms of endocrine disturbances were noted.</AbstractText>"}

Confirming reports from previous authors it was possible to show that a large proportion of muscles with proved lesions have a displacement of the frequency spectrum towards low frequencies('bass' displacement). The displacements were principally found in cases with old lesions. In a group of cases in which the symptoms had lasted a few months only a displacement towards high frequencies ('descant' displacement) was revealed. In view of these findings it was surprising to note a relatively large number of spectra with bass displacement in a group of cases in which the symptoms had lasted less than one month. The probable explanation of this is to be found in the fact that the muscles with bass displacement in this group principally belonged to patients with systemic diseases such as diabetes, alcoholism, renal insufficiency, itc., who quite possibly might have had earlier neurogenic lesions with a subclinical course. In the group of muscles with doubtful neurogenic lesions there was also found a comparatively large number of bass-displaced spectra. It was possible to show that here also there was a large number of patients with systemic diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Of 704 patients, 160 (22.7%) had some evidence of retinopathy, and 52 (7.4%) of these were already attending an ophthalmologist. A further 18 (2.6%) were known to have retinopathy and were being followed up in the diabetic clinic. Ninety (12.8%) new patients with diabetic retinopathy were discovered. Most had minimal changes, but 30 (4.3%) were considered to have changes severe enough to be referred to an ophthalmologist. Twenty-two (2.1%) underwent, or were awaiting, photocoagulation, and half of these had had no visual symptoms when first seen. Although some of these patients were already being treated or observed for retinopathy, it is encouraging that relatively few new patients needing treatment for retinopathy were discovered. If retinopathy could be detected early enough physicians might be able to deal with it and so ease pressure on ophthalmological services.</AbstractText>"}

The treatment was successful in all cases. Insulin was infused at a constant rate, during 12 hours as a mean value. Blood glucose fell regularly and no hypoglycemia occured. Serum potassium varied within narrow limits, and no accident related to hypokalemia was observed. The correction of ketoacidosis was delayed, as compared to that of hyperglycemia. The two elderly patients with hyperosmolality recovered quickly and completely. The method of low-dose insulin infusion seems thus effective and easily applicable, at least in an intensive care unit. Our experience prompted us to increase (10 u/h) rather than to decrease the insulin infusion rate, with the aim to obtain a faster correction of ketoacidosis.</AbstractText>"}

When cortisol replacement in the pituitary-ablated patients was increased to reproduce the high plasma concentrations found in severe ketoacidosis, blood ketones and glucose were increased but were still significantly lower than in the control diabetics.

Rats were killed on day 32 (presumed proestrus) or on day 33, at which time the oviducts were examined for ova. Ovarian weight gain was similar in control and diabetic rats and Graafian follicles were present in both groups on day 32. None of the diabetic rats ovulated while 96% of the control rats ovulated. Anovulation in diabetic rats could not be attributed to a drug side-effect of alloxan or to a lack of ovarian responsiveness, as 90% of the animals ovulated after treatment with insulin or with hCG (5 IU). Measurements of serum estradiol and LH on the morning of presumed proestrus revealed that concentrations of these hormones were not different in control and diabetic rats. However, measurements of LH in blood samples taken in the afternoon from control rats showed an LH surge, whereas no LH surge was found in diabetic rats. Thus, anovulation in immature diabetic rats treated with PMSG is not caused by an attenuation of ovarian responsiveness or by decreased secretion of estradiol, but rather is due to the loss of the LH surge.</AbstractText>"}

The extractions of glucose, lactate, pyruvate and free fatty acids by dog heart in vivo were calculated from measurements of their arterial and coronary sinus blood concentration. Elevation of plasma free fatty acid concentrations by infusion of intralipid and heparin resulted in increased extraction of free fatty acids and diminished extractions of glucose, lactate and pyruvate by the heart. It is suggested that metabolism of free fatty acids by the heart in vivo, as in vitro, may impair utilization of these substrates. These effects of elevated plasma free fatty acid concentrations on extractions by the heart in vivo were reversed by injection of dichloroacetate, which also improved extraction of lactate and pyruvate by the heart in vivo in alloxan diabetes. 2. Sodium dichloroacetate increased glucose oxidation and pyruvate oxidation in hearts from fed normal or alloxan-diabetic rats perfused with glucose and insulin. Dichloroacetate inhibited oxidation of acetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate and partially reversed inhibitory effects of these substrates on the oxidation of glucose. In rat diaphragm muscle dichloroacetate inhibited oxidation of acetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and palmitate and increased glucose oxidation and pyruvate oxidation in diaphragms from alloxan-diabetic rats. Dichloroacetate increased the rate of glycolysis in hearts perfused with glucose, insulin and acetate and evidence is given that this results from a lowering of the citrate concentration within the cell, with a consequent activation of phosphofructokinase. 3. In hearts from normal rats perfused with glucose and insulin, dichloroacetate increased cell concentrations of acetyl-CoA, acetylcarnitine and glutamate and lowered those of aspartate and malate. In perfusions with glucose, insulin and acetate, dichloroacetate lowered the cell citrate concentration without lowering the acetyl-CoA or acetylcarnitine concentrations. Measurements of specific radioactivities of acetyl-CoA, acetylcarnitine and citrate in perfusions with [1-(14)C]acetate indicated that dichloroacetate lowered the specific radio-activity of these substrates in the perfused heart. Evidence is given that dichloroacetate may not be metabolized by the heart to dichloroacetyl-CoA or dichloroacetylcarnitine or citrate or CO(2). 4. We suggest that dichloroacetate may activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, thus increasing the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine and the conversion of acetyl-CoA into glutamate, with consumption of aspartate and malate. Possible mechanisms for the changes in cell citrate concentration and for inhibitory effects of dichloroacetate on the oxidation of acetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and palmitate are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Eleven patients were treated with insulin, 12 with oral hypoglycaemic agents, and the rest were already on oral hypoglycaemic agents and had developed poor diabetic control; four of these required insulin. Whole-body potassium was measured before treatment was begun (or altered) and again one and six weeks later. Whole-body potassium (ratio of observed to expected) was initially reduced in most of the patients requiring insulin. After control of diabetes whole-body potassium increased significantly in the three groups. The increase in whole-body potassium in the individual patients varied over a wide range, and in patients who were treated with insulin it was often of a similar magnitude to that observed in patients in diabetic ketoacidosis.</AbstractText>"}

Glucose tolerance tests were performed on 130 subjects (49% of eligible individuals) and yielded diabetic curves in 18, 6 and 33% respectively for the three categories of positive screening tests.It is suggested that the magnitude of the group with positive history only is such that future natural history studies must take this subsample into consideration.</AbstractText>"}

HbAIc, when expressed as per cent of total hemoglobin, was 6.14 +/- 0.56% (m +/- SD) in women with normal GTT (n = 40) and found to be significantly (p less than 0,001) elevated in 7 women with abnormal GTT (7.54 +/- 0.61%; m +/- SD) and in the 5 women with insulin dependent diabetes (7.59 +/- 0.92%; m +/- SD). In patients with abnormal and boarderline GTT a linear relation between HbAIc and mean blood sugar, as determined from individually summarized 60 and 120 minutes GTT values, was observed.

They received three injections per day for 3 days each week of 3 U of protamine zinc insulin, .25 mg of zinc glucagon, 50 microgram of protamine zinc somatostatin (SRIF), or protamine zinc vehicle. Diabetes was then induced with an iv injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg), and the injection schedule was repeated after the full diabetic syndrome emerged. In all rats whose insulin levels were increased relative to glucagon levels, body weight increased; in those whose glucagon levels were increased relative to insulin levels, body weight decreased. All injections except vehicle reduced meal sizes in both normal and diabetic rats, but only insulin increased the frequency of feeding. These effects could be predicted by the glucostatic theory of food intake regulation and are thus interpreted as supportive of this theory. These results also support the hypothesis that the relative concentration of insulin to glucagon is a regulator of body weight set point.</AbstractText>"}

There was no evidence of a progressive change in the glucose curve detectable by the H index within the fourth quartile of pregnancy. There was no association between actual or potential fetal morbidity and any of the interpretative criteria employed.

Growth hormone and glucagon were suppressed throughout the infusion though delayed secretion of insulin occurred in association with both meals and an oral glucose load. Glucose tolerance was improved in one diabetic patient who was taking chlorpropamide while the other required much less insulin than usual. Secretion of endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone was lowered in one euthyroid patient on carbimazole. Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, ACTH, and prolactin were not affected. Serum somatomedin levels were reduced in one patient. There was a rapid rebound of all the suppressed hormones when the infusions stopped. Longer-acting analogues of GH-RIH will be needed before long-term therapy of acromegaly or diabetes mellitus becomes possible, but such preparations should be available soon for clinical trial.</AbstractText>"}

Aspects of health behaviour measured were: adherence to diet, insulin injection technique, urine self-testing and the pattern of action adopted in response to hypo- and hyperglycemia. Data were collected in 1975, from 170 insulin-dependent diabetics, aged 18-41, with known diabetes of from 6 months to 12 years duration. A standard questionnaire included items on health behaviour, knowledge of the disease and other factors. Of the subjects studied only 40% stated that they adhered to diet prescription. Occasional insulin injections were missed by 15%. Half the patients restricted diet or increased insulin dose in hyperglycemia but only 18% regularly tested urine for sugar. An important determinant of health behaviour was the level of understanding of the disease, which was found to be low among 58%. The present health education system for diabetic patients in Poland is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

When the insulin response was related to pubertal ratings in the children and adolescents with growth retardation, it was found that the mean fasting levels and mean peak response both rose with the progression of puberty. This tendency was more pronounced in the females. When the insulin response was related to the degree of adiposity as measured by the degree of subscapular skinfold thickness, it was found that the greater the adiposity, the greater was the mean response, with the females showing higher levels than the males in each group. Even when the response in the two sexes was compared in subjects of a similar age and skinfold thickness, the females had a higher mean peak insulin response than did the males.</AbstractText>"}

The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of 230 patients who had neither history of insulin-dependent diabetes nor prior teatment with reserpine or guanethidine. Group 2 included 41 insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Group 3 contained 27 hypertensive patients who had been taking reserpine or guanethidine. Patients in each group were divided into two subgroups (A and B). The 202 patients in the three A subgroups received preoperative phenylephrine eyedrops, whereas the 96 patients in the three B subgroups did not. All three B subgroups and Group 1A (176 patients) did not show significant increases in blood pressure. There was a statistically significant increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures in Group 2A (14 patients) and in Group 3A (12 patients). From this study, we concluded that administration of preoperative phenylephrine eyedrops can be hazardous in patients with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes or in hypertensive patients receiving reserpine or guanethidine.</AbstractText>"}

After treatment of the diabetic goats with insulin for 4--5 days--the last 24 h intravenously--lactose secretion returned to the control values before alloxan administration provided that normoglycemia developed. In 2 experiments infusion of a large dose of insulin caused hypoglycemia and a 20--30 per cent reduction in lactose secretion rates. In the course of 1 h after withdrawal of the insulin infusion, patent signs of insulin deficiency developed as evidenced by steadily increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Nevertheless, lactose secretion continued at the same rate as during insulin infusion for the 4 h studied after discontinuation of the insulin infusion. In the goats where lactose secretion was reduced due to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, lactose secretion returned to control values when following discontinuation of insulin infusion the plasma glucose concentrations increased into normal and diabetic ranges. It is concluded that during insulin deficiency of short term duration, mammary lactose secretion was maintained at a normal rate. Since lactose is the major product of mammary glucose utilization, it is suggested that glucose uptake in the mammary gland was not reduced by short term insulin deficiency.</AbstractText>"}

We confirmed that Ketostix reacts strongly with acetoacetate, giving a useful range of 0 to 10 mM for plasma acetoacetate, that acetone reacts weakly, and that 3-hydroxybutyrate does not react at all. Plasma Ketostix readings correlated only moderately well with enzymatically determined whole-blood acetoacetate. All samples giving a + + + reaction contained more than 1.6 mM acetoacetate while only 4 out of 21 samples showing 0 contained more than 0.4 mM. Comparison of Ketostix readings with total blood ketone body content showed poor correlation. One reason for this was the large variation in the ratio of 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate in ketoacidosis; another was that often Ketostix had been stored in such a way that they had become damp, which impairs their reliability. If the Ketostix reading and estimation of the blood pH show a discrepancy we suggest that an enzymatic assay should be used to determine the ketone bodies and lactate.</AbstractText>"}

Animals were studied under ordinary conditions and when fat mobilization was increased abruptly by infusing norepinephrine or for a prolonged period by withdrawing insulin from depancreatized dogs. 80% of hepatic blood flow was assumed to be derived from the portal vein. Hepatic uptake was proportional to net outflow transport of plasma free fatty acids in the three groups and, in each, hepatic extraction fraction was about 25%. Since specific activity of free fatty acids entering and leaving the liver was equal and their composition was closely similar in the three sites sampled, it was concluded that palmitate is a representative tracer for free fatty acids entering the liver and that the liver does not release free fatty acids into the blood. In norepinephrine-infused dogs, the fraction of free fatty acids secreted in triglycerides (13%) was similar to that of control animals, so that transport of triglycerides was increased. In diabetic dogs no increased transport could be demonstrated since an average of only 2% of free fatty acids was converted to plasma triglyceride fatty acids; the hyperlipemia uniformly observed therefore appeared to result from defective removal of triglycerides from the blood.A similar fraction of free fatty acids was converted to ketones in normal and norepinephrine-infused dogs. This fraction was somewhat higher in diabetic animals and, in addition, a substantial quantity of ketones was derived from unlabeled precursors. Fractional conversion of free fatty acids to CO(2) was similar in normal and norepinephrine-infused dogs, but reduced in the diabetics.</AbstractText>"}

The results of these studies show that lymphocytes from diabetic patients have decreased ability to specificity bind insulin when compared to lymphocytes from normal subjects. For example, when lymphocytes from diabetic patients and a trace amount of [(125)I]insulin (3.3 x 10(-11) M) were incubated, binding was less than 50% of the value obtained with lymphocytes from normal subjects (2+/-0.2% vs. 4.2+/-0.4%). Furthermore, the data show that lymphocytes from diabetic patients have only 1,200 insulin receptor sites per cell compared to 2,200 sites per cell for lymphocytes from normal subjects. Competitive inhibition studies using unlabeled insulin indicate that the affinity for insulin of lymphocytes from both groups is comparable. Consequently the decreased insulin binding of diabetics' lymphocytes is primarily due to a decreased number of available receptors rather than decreased binding affinity. This decreased insulin binding is not due to chronic hyperglycemia since insulin binding to lymphocytes, obtained from four patients with fasting hyperglycemia secondary to chronic pancreatitis, was completely normal. The possibility that some factor present in the plasma of diabetic patients could cause decreased insulin binding also seems unlikely since we could demonstrate no in vitro effects of diabetics' plasma on insulin binding. Lastly, the proportion of lymphocytes which were thymus derived and bone marrow derived were the same in each of the study groups indicating that differences in lymphocyte subpopulations do not account for our results.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='IN CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>(a) lymphocytes from nonobese, untreated, adult diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia demonstrate a decreased ability to bind insulin; (b) this decreased insulin binding to lymphocytes obtained from diabetic patients can be accounted for primarily by an absolute decrease in the number of available receptor sites per cell; and (c) these data suggest that this defect in insulin binding is a primary phenomenon.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":4541674,"Title":"Stimulation of human prolactin secretion by intravenous infusion of L-tryptophan.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Aug 1973","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Previous studies have demonstrated that the secretion of human prolactin is regulated primarily by factors that influence catecholamines of the hypothalamus. In an effort to identify other factors that may regulate prolactin secretion, the amino acid L-tryptophan, a precursor in the synthesis of serotonin, was infused into normal human volunteers. Intravenous infusion of L-tryptophan, 5-10 g over a 20 min period, but not equivalent amounts of 17 other amino acids, induced marked increases in serum prolactin concentrations in eight normal human volunteers. Increases of 20-200 ng/ml above the control level were observed with peak values at 20-45 min after initiation of the infusion. In addition, infusion of L-tryptophan was associated with decreases in serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyrotropin in those subjects in whom the base-line serum hormone concentration was above the lower limits of assay detectability. No consistent change was observed in serum concentrations of growth hormone, cortisol, or glucose. Four subjects with juvenile diabetes demonstrated increases in serum prolactin values comparable with those observed in healthy individuals in response to infusions of L-tryptophan. Serum prolactin values in patients with surgically induced hypopituitarism were undetectable or deficient after infusion of 10 g of L-tryptophan. In this respect, infusion of L-tryptophan was equally effective in these subjects as the standard chlorpromazine stimulation test in identifying patients with hypopituitarism, indicating that the infusion of L-tryptophan may serve as a sensitive and reliable clinical test of prolactin secretory reserve. Further studies relating to the possible mechanism of action of L-tryptophan indicated that infusion of 5-hydroxytryptophan represents a much more potent stimulus for the secretion of prolactin and that premedication with the serotonin antagonist, methysergide maleate, serves to blunt the effect of L-tryptophan on prolactin secretion. These results support the concept that the effect of L-tryptophan on the secretion of human prolactin is mediated through its conversion to serotonin and are consistent with reported experimental observations that serotonin may participate in the reciprocal regulation of prolactin and gonadotropins.</AbstractText>"}

The degree of penetrance is approximately 80%. These patients have had recurrent attacks of abdominal pain starting from childhood or young adult life. The mean age of onset in the 7 families studied was 13.6 years. There were two peaks, with maximum numbers at 5 years and 17 years. The second peak was thought to represent genetically susceptible individuals having pain brought on by alcohol rather than representing evidence of genetic heterogeneity. Five of the 7 families had members with both childhood and adult ages of onset. Only 4 patients out of 72 had life-threatening disease and in the majority of cases the attacks of pain were of nuisance value only. Hereditary pancreatitis was implicated in only 1 patient's death and this was not definite. Patients appear to get better after a period of symptoms usually as they approach middle age, or after a severe attack. In older patients alcohol, emotional upsets, and fatty food appear to precipitate attacks. Pancreatic insufficiency (5.5%), diabetes mellitus (12.5%), pseudocysts (5.5%), and haemorrhagic pleural effusion are uncommon complications. Portal vein thrombosis occurred definitely in 2 patients and was suspected in 3 others. Carcinoma of the pancreas was not found in any of 72 patients studied in detail; however, 2 members from a family not visited personally had chronic pancreatitis and malabsorption going on to carcinoma. They may have suffered from a different disease. Genetic linkage information was too slight for many definite conclusions. However, there was no suggestion of linkage with any of the markers tested.</AbstractText>"}

These methods are vitreous fluorophotometry and fluorometric determination of segmental retinal blood flow. Vitreous fluorophotometry has shown that a disturbance of the blood-retinal barrier, possibly functional, appears in diabetic eyes before any lesion is clinically visible in the fundus, and that there is a close correlation between the severity of the vascular lesions and higher vitreous fluorophotometry readings. Blood flow studies have shown that in diabetes the retinal blood flow increases markedly with progress of background retinopathy, decreasing finally where proliferative retinopathy, with marked arteriolar narrowing, is present. On the basis of these findings a working hypothesis for the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy is presented.</AbstractText>"}

In both instances, bypass was successfully terminated shortly after the insulin injection. These clinical observations led to experiments under the controlled conditions provided by the isolated, working rat heart preparation. The recovery of contractility after 30 minutes of severe ischemia was assessed in all 11 control and 11 insulin-treated hearts. Myocardial performance, as judged by the product of heart rate and peak systolic blood pressure, was significantly greater in the insulin-treated hearts. These clinical observations and experimental findings suggest the need for more extensive study of the potential value of insulin in treating depressed contractility after prolonged myocardial ischemia.</AbstractText>"}

A summary of 14 reports in the literature revealed seven fetal deaths in 1739 patients within 1 week of a negative CST, an incidence of 0.4%. This prompted an investigation of our results for comparison. During the period January 1, 1975, to February 28, 1977, 746 patients underwent 1119 CSTs. Seven fetal deaths occurred in 680 patients within 1 week of a negative CST, an incidence of 1.0%. Although maternal conditions associated with fetal demise within 1 week of a negative CST include diabetes mellitus, prolonged pregnancy, chronic hypertension, and pre-eclampsia, fetal death in most instances resulted from factors other than uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI). Conditions commonly associated with fetal demise following a negative CST were umbilical cord accidents, severe congenital anomalies, and abruptio placentae. The low incidence of fetal death after a negative CST supports continued use of the CST in evaluation of high-risk pregnancies.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetes mellitus is known to reduce immunological competence. These studies compare the effects of bovine growth hormone (bGH) and the growth factor produced by plerocercoid larvae of the tapeworm, Spirometra mansonoides, on metabolism of lymphoid tissue, thymus and spleen, in hypophysectomized rats made diabetic with a single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan. Whereas the control diabetic-hypophysectomized rats gradually lost weight throughout the experimental period, both bGH and plerocercoid infection caused significant weight gains during the experimental period. The diabetic-hypophysectomized rats treated with bGH had significantly heavier thymuses and spleens than controls. Plerocercoid infection also caused significant increases in thymus weights. Both bGH and plerocercoids stimulated the metabolic activity of thymocytes isolated from treated rats and tested for their ability to incorporate 3H-thymidine into DNA in vitro. Thus, these growth factors have similar effects on the lymphoid tissue of diabetic-hypophysectomized rats which are apparently independent of normal insulin levels. Whether this anabolic effect is direct or mediated by somatomedin remains to be determined.</AbstractText>"}

The diabetic-hypophysectomized control rats gradually lost weight throughout the experiment but both growth hormone and plerocercoids stimulated marked weight gains. Growth hormone treatment resulted in a loss of depot fat from the epididymal fat pads and caused a reduction of liver and serum cholesterol concentrations but had no effect on triglyceride concentrations of either liver or serum. However, plerocercoid infection resulted in increased weights of the epididymal fat pads and increased liver and serum triglyceride concentrations. Serum cholesterol was slightly increased but liver cholesterol was decreased in the plerocercoid-infected rats. Therefore, in the absence of pituitary hormones and insulin, these growth factors had similar effects on body growth but distinctly different effects on lipid metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

Absorption of all FTA-200-reactive sera with an extract of Reiter's treponeme eliminated most of the positive reactions in sera from diabetic patients, and three of the five positive reactions detected in sera from apparently normal subjects. On immunoelectrophoresis, precipitin bands developed most frequently between the Reiter sorbent and sera from diabetic patients positive in the FTA-200 test. Serum components responsible for FTA reactivity and precipitin reactions against the sorbent were resistant to treatment with mercaptoethanol, suggesting antibody of the IgG class. Cross-reacting antibodies produced in response to normal treponemal flora, and perhaps acquiring enhanced reactivity by means of nonspecific interacting substances in sera peculiar to the altered physiological state of diabetes, are suggested as possible causes of positive reactions of unabsorbed sera. No correlation could be made between age of the diabetic patient, treatment or duration of the disease, and FTA or precipitin reactivity of the patient's serum.</AbstractText>"}

Amount of D-glucaric acid, L-ascorbic acid, and D-glucuronic acid in urine increased in the case of the alloxan diabetic rabbits. The transformation from D-glucuronolactone to D-glucaric acid was higher than normal in the diabetic animals. The expired 14-CO2 decreased and urinary excretion of labeled L-gulonic acid increased after administration of 6-14-C-glucuronolactone in the diabetic rabbits. L-Gulonic acid dehydrogenase, lactonase II, and beta-glucuronidase activities were reduced, and UDPGA-pyrophosphatase, D-glucuronic acid-1-phosphatase, and UDPGA-transferase activities increased in the diabetic rabbit liver. From these results, it may be concluded that an increase of endogenous D-glucuronic acid in the diabetic states could be attributed to a metabolid defect in the step of L-gulonic acid dehydrogenation and to the enhancement of UDPGA-pyrophosphatase and D-glucuronic acid-1-phosphate phosphatase activities.</AbstractText>"}

Mean daily urine volume without therapy was 5.4 l and dropped to 1.1 and 1.6 l/day while receiving pitressin and DDAVP, respectively. Oral agents decreased the daily urine volume to 2.2 l in patients with partial DI, with good symptomatic control except for some nocturia. These agents had no effect in patients with complete DI and did not alter pitressin requirements. Duration of pitressin action was 24 to 36 hours with a significant incidence of hyponatremia. The duration of DDAVP effect was 8 to 20 hours, varying in individual patients. Children with partial DI required smaller doses of DDAVP and the duration of action was longer than in those with complete DI. Control of serum electrolytes was excellent using two doses per day and nocturia was eliminated. All patients who had received pitressin had growth hormone antibodies, but continued to grow normally unless there was pre-existing growth hormone deficiency. These antibodies gradually disappeared after approximately one year of therapy with oral agents or DDAVP. DDAVP did not alter growth hormone, cortisol, or prolactin levels during sleep. DDAVP is the antidiuretic therapy of choice in children with either complete or partial DI; to date, no side effects have been demonstrated.</AbstractText>"}

The biomedical risk factors of interest were serum concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of coronary disease, electrocardiographic abnormalities, obesity, and age. The findings did not reveal any significant differences in mean lipid levels between patients showing progression of disease and those who did not. However, the distribution of serum cholesterol values indicated more hypercholesterolemic patients among the disease-progression group, and more patients with ideal cholesterol levels among the no-progression group. The other biomedical variables did not appear to be related to the progression of coronary disease. Among the older patients, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus were related to disease progression. Among the younger patients, smoking was related to progression.</AbstractText>"}

Insulin hypersecretion (with or without glucose intolerance), endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, and abnormal liver function suggesting hepatic steatosis were shown to exist in the relatives mostly in combined fashion. Correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the combined disorder developed on the basis of obesity. The incidence of diabetes mellitus was significantly high in the relatives (14.8 per cent) as compared with the normal Japanese population (3.5 per cent). Although the vertical transmission of the combined disorder was noted in almost all pedigrees, the frequency distribution analysis of insulin response, glucose tolerance, and plasma triglyceride showed the histograms of these variables similarly skewed to the right as compared with those of the controls, with no apparent bimodality. In view of the hitherto suggested role of insulin in triglyceride metabolism, it is concluded that hyperinsulinemia coupled with obesity seems to be the basic trait of this form of familial hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, though the mode of transmission remains to be elucidated.</AbstractText>"}

A reversible defect in host defense in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.","Journal":"Diabetes","Date":"Jun 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>When the ability of granulocytes from 10 poorly controlled diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia and no evidence of ketoacidosis (mean fasting glucose 293 +/- 20 mg. per 100 ml.; mean +/- S.E.M.) to adhere to a nylon fiber column was assessed, the number of adherent granulocytes from whole blood was only 53 +/- 6 per cent of the values observed in controls. After antidiabetic treatment for one to two weeks and lowering of fasting glucose levels (mean 198 +/- 29 mg. per 100 ml.), adherence improved significantly (p less than 0.01) in the diabetics; however, their values were still subnormal (diabetic 74 per cent +/- 8 of control; p less than 0.02). Adherence values before and after treatment correlated with the fasting glucose level (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that, in addition to previously reported abnormalities in migration and the ingestion and killing of bacteria, granulocyte adherence may also be impaired in poorly controlled diabetic patients. This functional abnormality correlates directly with the fasting glucose and is reversed by insulin treatment. A defect of this type may compromise the normal inflammatory response in some diabetics and impair their capacity to resist infection.</AbstractText>"}

Two levels of hyperglucagonemia were induced by means of constant intravenous infusion. Raising plasma glucagon concentrations to levels reported in poorly controlled diabetics (450 to 665 pg. per milliliter) did not alter total insulin requirements or blood glucose concentrations. Higher glucagon concentrations (850 to 1,050 pg. per milliliter) caused a modest (26 per cent) increase in insulin requirements and only a slight increase in mean blood glucose concentrations. These studies demonstrate that the degree of hyperglucagonemia found most frequently in insulin-requiring diabetics does not increase insulin requirements or decrease insulin effectiveness in patients given insulin in amounts appropriate to maintain euglycemia.</AbstractText>"}

Though intravenous glucose tolerance deteriorates between the second and third trimesters in women with no features of diabetes, a significant improvement occurs after a course of chlorpropamide in a daily dosage of 100 mg during pregnancy in chemical diabetes, but this treatment did not enhance the rate of return to normal glucose tolerance post partum.Plasma glucose and insulin studies showed no evidence of hypoglycaemia or hyperinsulinism in the mother at delivery or in the newborn when chlorpropamide had been used compared with a group receiving no such treatment. In the infants of the chlorpropamide-treated mothers there was a suggestion of an increased rate of glucose disposal in response to a glucose challenge, but no increase in birth weight.There were two fetal deaths in the 50 pregnancies of mothers treated with chlorpropamide, one being due to a mistaken premature delivery and the other to a diaphragmatic hernia. Thus chlorpropamide in a dose of 100 mg a day has been shown to reverse chemical diabetes diagnosed and treated in pregnancy without apparent risk to the fetus.</AbstractText>"}

The width of mesangial staining for AMY is increased in rats diabetic for four months (p less than 0.01) and seven months (p less than 0.0005) compared with age-matched controls. Mesangial AMY staining of unilaterally nephrectomized control animals was moderately increased after seven months, whereas unilaterally nephrectomized diabetic rats had prominently increased AMY mesangial width at four months, when they were compared with intact diabetic animals (p less than 0.05). Thus, a distinctive alteration that is found in human diabetic nephropathy also occurs in experimental (streptozotocin) diabetes in the rat. Further, this alteration appears to be accelerated by the changes in nephron hemodynamics resulting from unilateral nephrectomy. While the function of mesangial AMY is unknown, it may be related to intrarenal regulation of glomerular ultrafiltration, which appears to be altered in diabetic nephropathy in man.</AbstractText>"}

The mechanisms for the production of pruritus in these disorders are poorly understood and frequently are unrelated to liberation of histamine. Proteolytic enzymes in lymphoproliferative disorders, bile acids in obstructive hepatobiliary disease, parathyroid hormone in chronic renal failure, and prostaglandins and kinins are but a few of the chemicals that may ultimately be responsible for the development of pruritus in these and other purely cutaneous disorders. Patients with essential pruritus should have a comprehensive physical and laboratory evaluation, but psychologic, environmental, and other factors must be considered when thorough clinical evaluation is unrewarding. Treatment should be directed towards elimination of the underlying alteration, control of the additional factors, and alleviation of the symptom.</AbstractText>"}

Effects of hypertension alone and in combination with diabetes mellitus.","Journal":"Circulation research","Date":"Jun 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Hypertension is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and often occurs in association with diabetes mellitus. Specific activities of hydrolases in homogenates of aortas from rats with renal-clip hypertension, normotension following a period of hypertension, and hypertension combined with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus were measured. Enzymes included: neutral alpha-glucosidase, and lysosomal N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, cathepsin C, acid alpha-glucosidase, and acid cholesteryl esterase. After 6 or 12 weeks of hypertension, specific activities of all enzymes measured were significantly increased, levels ranging from 24% above normal for cathepsin C to 351% above normal for N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. Six weeks of normotension following 6 weeks of hypertension resulted in restoration to normal of four of the six enzyme activities; the remaining two enzymes were significantly below normal levels. Combined hypertension and diabetes mellitus showed smooth muscle cell levels of four of the five hydrolases measured to be significantly lower than those present with hypertension alone. In every instance, histochemical studies of aortas showed acid phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities which corresponded to the biochemical findings. These findings indicate profound and discrete effects of two clinical risk factors on vascular smooth muscle cell lysosomes.</AbstractText>"}

After seven days, Candida albicans could no longer be cultured from 86 (90%) of 96 men, nor from 55 (95%) of 58 men three weeks after treatment. Microscopical examination gave varying results. Fifteen (10.9%) of 138 men were found to have diabetes mellitus; this group was significantly older than the non-diabetics.

Ten of these had occlusive atherosclerosis and in none of these did the associated risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes appear to be operative, and most were manual laborers. Their mean serum cholesterol measurement was found to be 222 mg. per cent, a value which is found in 25 per cent of the urban Black population. In the remaining three patients, the coronary arteries were found to be angiographically normal and two of these were associated with the billowing mitral leaflet syndrome; it is postulated that their myocardial infarction was a result of coronary spasm, or a consequence of fibrin emboli emanating from the redundant mitral leaflets. Based on statistics from our major referring hospital, it is estimated that the prevalence rate from myocardial infarction among general admissions to a medical ward is less than 0.05 per cent, a figure lower than previously reported by clinico-electrocardiographic studies. It would appear that the prevalence of this disease has not increased over the last two decades and the immunity of the Black population is unexplained.</AbstractText>"}

Consistent bihormonal suppression occurred at rates as low as 24 ng per kg per min, but was variable at 12 and 2.4 ng per kg per min. When somatostatin-induced (3.3 mug per min) hypoglucagonemia was corrected by exogenous glucagon, hyperglycemia occurred. In dogs with long-standing insulin-requiring alloxan diabetes 3.3 mug per min of somatostatin suppressed glucagon to 55 pg per ml throughout the 30-min infusion and lowered glucose by 36.4+/-6.1 mg per dl, about 1 mg per dl per min. Glucagon suppression was maintained despite alanine infusion, and glucose, which rose 29 mg per dl during alanine infusion without somatostatin, declined 58 mg per dl in the somatostatin-treated diabetic dogs despite alanine. Continuous infusion of somatostatin for 24 h in five insulin-requiring alloxan-diabetic dogs suppressed glucagon and lowered glucose significantly, usually to below normal. It is concluded that in normal dogs pharmacologic doses of somatostatin virtually abolish insulin and glucagon secretion in the basal state and during hyperaminoacidemia. Hyperglycemia occurs during somatostatin-induced insulin lack only if hypoglucagonemia is corrected. Somatostatin suppresses glucagon in diabetic dogs and lowers their plasma glucose approximately 1 mg per dl per min, even when the gluconeogenic substrate alanine is abundant. Glucagon suppression can be maintained for several hours in such dogs and hyperglycemia is thereby reduced.</AbstractText>"}

Hyperparathyroidism can cause granular decalcification in the skull. Hypoparathyroidism produces calcification of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Lesions due due to metastatic malignancies or eosinophilic granulomas may be noted in cases of diabetes insipidus. Sellar enlargement may be due to the 'empty sella' syndrome. Twenty-five percent of all cases of enlarged sella may be accounted for by this syndrome.</AbstractText>"}

Patients may demonstrate varying degrees of either or both lesions. Diet has an important place in the treatment of all diabetics. The most important objective is control of total caloric intake to attain and maintain ideal body weight. Obesity is diabetogenic. The diet of children with diabetes should allow them to grow and develop normally. Insulin-dependent diabetics must eat meals on a regular schedule. Carbohydrate intake should not be disproportionately restricted. Fat intake in diabetics and in nondiabetics should comprise only about 30% of total calories. Dietary instruction should not be a one-time affair. Physicians should seek the assistance of diet counselors when they are available. Many basic questions about diet and diabetes remain unanswered.</AbstractText>"}

These subjects had initially shown glucose intolerance, insulinopenia and hyperlipidemia comparable to those of diabetic patients matched for age and sex, but vascular complications were not present in dwarfs. After 10 years glucose tolerance became progessively more abnormal in dwarfs than could be accounted for by expected deterioration with age, and hyperglycemia after mixed meals remained greater than in control subjects. Serum lipid and serum lipoprotein concentrations were abnormal in over one third of the dwarfs. Despite the metabolic similarity to the diabetic patients, clinical complications of diabetes were absent in dwarfs: retinopathy did not occur, and the prevalence of hypertension and arteriosclerosis was considerably lower in dwarfs than in the diabetic subjects in both study periods. The follow-up data support the hypothesis that growth hormone has at least a supportive role in the pathogenesis of vascular disease in the diabetic state.</AbstractText>"}

It is important to recognize and deal with these factors in attempting to correct malnutrition and in prescribing dietary treatment. Malnutrition includes a variety of disorders: undernutrition, nutrient deficiencies and imbalances, and obesity. Frequent small feedings, with nutritional supplements for patients with profound weight loss, are the initial treatment for undernutrition. Iron supplements and a diet of foods rich in iron and in promoting iron absorption are required in treating iron deficiency anemia. Management of macrocytic anemia should include specific nutrient therapy plus improvement of diet to include leafy vegetables and animal foodstuffs. Diet is an important adjunct in treating chronic diseases. Maturity-onset diabetes mellitus often can be managed by diet alone, with attention to correct proportions of fat, carbohydrate, and protein and to the decreased caloric requirements of elderly patients. The importance of continuing dietary modifications in hyperlipidemia and hypertension is well known. Although dietary manipulation in osteoporosis is not curative, a diet high in calcium and containing adequate floride and vitamin D affords maximum dietary protection against progress of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

In both groups falling corneal sensitivity and vibratory perception were found with increasing age over and above 50 years.

Five additional members of the family had died, probably because of this same illness. Deafness occurred in five family members with nephropathy and in one without renal disease. Ten of 12 affected males died in uremia before they had reached the age of 40 years. One of seven affected females died following a pregnancy. In two surviving patients, special investigations failed to elicit intrinsic tubular defects such as amino-aciduria, renal tubular acidosis, hyperphosphaturia or renal glucosuria. Systemic illness such as abnormal aminoacids in serum, primary hyperoxaluria, diabetes mellitus and infections were also excluded. Immunological defects were not demonstrable and the staining of renal biopsy tissue with fluorescein-labelled anti-beta(1)c, anti-IgG and antifibrinogen was negative. Renal tissue material of early, advanced and terminal hereditary nephropathy showed both tubular and interstitial, vascular and glomerular lesions. Electronmicroscopy showed marked thickening of tubular and glomerular basement membranes, increase of mesangial tissue and fusion of foot processes but failed to demonstrate 'immune deposits.' It is postulated therefore that hereditary nephropathy results from an inborn error of metabolism where an as yet unidentified metabolite damages the renal tissue as well as the acoustic nerve, analogous perhaps to the action of certain drugs, e.g. nephro-ototoxic antibiotics.</AbstractText>"}

HLA tissue typing for A, B, C and D series antigens carried out in 19 of the members showed no association between specific HLA antigens and imparied glucose tolerance.

After treatment, oral glucose tolerance and hypoglycaemic effect of tolbutamide were significantly improved; plasma insulin response was reduced after glucose and unmodified after tolbutamide; fasting plasma glucose was also significantly reduced. These findings did not correlate with the observed fall in serum lipids. Short-term clofibrate improves glucose metabolism in mild diabetes irrespective of its effects on lipid metabolism. It is suggested that the drug's action may be mediated by reduced insulin resistance.</AbstractText>"}

However, insulin responses to Iso were variably reduced as compared to normal in the diabetics. In order to evaluate the importance of the Iso dose, dose-response studies were performed in 9 diabetics (fasting plasma glucose greater than 150 mg/dl) and 10 age-matched controls. In both control subjects and diabetics, 0.5 microgram Iso produced no insulin response; 2 micrograms Iso produced an intermediate response; and 8 and 12 micrograms Iso produced a higher response. The insulin responses to the larger doses of Iso were lower in diabetics than control subjects (8 micrograms, 20 +/- 5 vs. 39 +/- 6 (P less than 0.025); 12 micrograms, 21 +/- 6 vs. 37 +/- 4 (P less than 0.05); means +/- SEM, microU/ml). Of 16 diabetics who received 12 micrograms Iso, 5 had insulin responses greater than 2 SD below the control mean, while others had responses that spanned the entire range of normal. Seven diabetics also were given iv secretin (150 U). Their insulin responses to secretin correlated with the responses to Iso (r = 0.83, P less than 0.02). Thus, patients with subnormal responses to Iso also had low secretion responses. The abnormalities of acute insulin secretion in diabetics can be explained by a lesion variably affecting islet membrane receptors; some patients may have glucose receptor damage, but intact responses to other stimuli, and others may have more widespread damage affecting beta-adrenergic and secretin responses as well. Alternatively, there may be heterogeneity in adult onset diabetes, as patients with low responses to all stimuli could have a qualitatively different lesion affecting insulin secretory capacity rather than membrane receptors.</AbstractText>"}

The total islet volume Vi was 0.974 cm3 in the control, whereas it was only 0.596 and 0.255 cm3 in the maturity-onset and growth-onset diabetic groups, respectively. The hypertensive group gave almost the same value as the control. There was an obvious negative correlation between Vi and the maximum blood sugar level during glucose tolerance test, whether the case was diabetic or not. Moreover, in the diabetic group Vi diminished with descending age of onset. These findings indicate the importance of VI in the pathophysiology of diabetes and support the classical concept of insulin deficiency as the primary pathogenetic role. On the other hand, the total islet number Ni decreased with increasing mean radius r, and the diabetic and control cases shared a common regression of Ni on r. The diabetic pancreas was not characterized by Ni, r or by the distribution pattern of r.</AbstractText>"}

At the same time, the procedures described admittedly present problems and may not be generally available to the vast majority of diabetics. The definitive answer lies in attempting to control diabetes to prevent the development of these and other complications. A number of laboratories are attempting to develop an artificial pancreas or islet transplantation to substitute for the insulin secretory capacity that has been lost or impaired. This is an area of research that demands the highest priority. One cannot be confident that present therapeutic programs can be altered to provide the type of diabetic control necessary for the prevention of complications.</AbstractText>"}

The release of C-peptide was measured after a (1) normal intravenous glucose tolerance test, (2) a double glucose tolerance test, (3) an arginine infusion, and (4) after an intravenous glucose tolerance test followed by an arginine infusion. Under all conditions the intravenous glucose load had only a minimal effect on the secretion of C-peptide, while arginine alone or after the intravenous glucose tolerance test stimulated the release of the peptide in all patients. Pretreatment with glucose did not augment the effect of arginine on C-peptide release. The results indicate that during the remission phase of juvenile-onset diabetes the endocrine pancreas does not recognize glucose as and appropriate signal for C-peptide release and cannot transform the amplifying effect of glucose into a higher hormonal secretion rate.</AbstractText>"}

Although the islet cell calcification appears to be related to the hypercalcemia, the pathogenesis of the calcification is not clear, as primary metastatic calcification of pancreatic islets due to hypercalcemia does not occur. In support of this, a retrospective study of pancreatic tissue from 52 hypercalcemic patients with parathyroid adenoma and 34 patients with multiple myeloma, who frequently have hypercalcemia, did not reveal islet calcification. The islet calcification is ascribed to primary islet cell degeneration and necrosis, with hypercalcemia playing an augmenting but crucial role. It is considered that the combination of islet degeneration and calcification resulted in the diabetic state.</AbstractText>"}

We have now shown that the 'phosphate flush' is much smaller with islets from fetal rats 21 1/2 days old. This could be attributed to decreased cellular stores of radioactivity, especially inorganic orthophosphate (32P), at the onset of stimulation, which may have been due, in part, to the diminished ability of fetal islets to retain the radiophosphorus accumulated during the labeling period. Certain other differences in phosphate metabolism were also observed. With prelabeled islets from adult rats, exposure to 3.0 mg. per milliliter glucose effected acute increases in the tissue content of AT32P and GT32P. Comparable stimulation of prelabeled fetal islets with 3.0 mg. per milliliter glucose did not elicit detectable changes in the labeling of ATP or GTP. The findings indicate that selected aspects of phosphate metabolism may be immature in fetal islets and, perhaps, implicated in their obtunded secretion of insulin in response to stimulation with glucose.</AbstractText>"}

Between 1962 and 1977, a total of 141 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and 120 patients with uremia caused by renal involvement in systemic disease were treated. With the exception of two patients with bacterial endocarditis who died early in their course, survival in the diagnostic categories studied ranged from acceptable, in diabetics with 29 of 53 (54.7%) patients living, to excellent in tuberculosis where all of six patients are alive and well. Overall, it is concluded that uremia in systemic disease is responsive to maintenace hemodialysis.</AbstractText>"}

In vitro, this glycosylation imparts an increased susceptibility of the crystallins to sulfhydryl oxidation. Disulfide crosslinks result in the formation of high molecular weight aggregates and an opalescence in the crystallin solutions. The addition of reducing agents prevents as well as reverses the formation of high molecular weight aggregates and the opalescence of the crystallins. These phenomena suggest a new interpretation of previous results on cataract formation and a new approach for development of drugs to prevent cataracts.</AbstractText>"}

The level of pyridoxal was significantly lower in these patients when compared with randomly selected diabetic patients matched for age and sex without clinical evidence of neuropathy. There was no significant difference in the duration of the diabetes between the two groups. The results indicate an association between pyridoxal deficiency and neuropathy in diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

VLDL triglyceride levels were also elevated in the diabetics. An analysis of lipoprotein composition suggested that these changes primarily reflect changes in numbers of particles, since lipid composition and lipid/protein ratios were similar in lipoproteins isolated from normals and diabetics. The ratio of ester/free cholesterol in LDL and HDL was lower in normal Pima Indians than in a comparable group of Caucasians, although plasma LCAT activity was not significantly different. The data indicate that diabetes may be associated with shifts in distribution of LDL and HDL, as well as with increases in VLDL.</AbstractText>"}

Evidence for regulation of glucagon receptors by hyperglucagonemia.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Jun 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The effects of endogenous and exogenous hyperglucagonemia on the specific binding of glucagon to hepatocyte receptors was studied, as was the response of cAMP to glucagon. In streptozotocin diabetic rats, blood glucose and plasma glucagon increased and plasma insulin decreased as compared with controls. Insulin treatment in diabetic rats restored blood glucose and plasma glucagon toward normal and elevated plasma insulin. Specific binding of (125)I-glucagon to isolated hepatocytes (10(6) cells) decreased in diabetic rats (8.17+/-0.38%) compared to controls (14.05+/-0.87%) and was restored by insulin treatment (12.25+/-0.93%). Specific binding of (125)I-insulin in controls was 7.30+/-10.16%; it increased in diabetic rats to 12.50+/-0.86%, and decreased in diabetic rats after insulin treatment (9.08+/-0.87%). Scatchard analysis and the competition plots of the data indicate that decreased glucagon binding and increased insulin binding in diabetes were due to change in the number of receptors rather than a change in their affinity. Hepatocyte cAMP response to glucagon (0.25-5.0 ng/ml) was almost abolished in diabetic rats and was restored with insulin treatment. Specific glucagon binding by hepatocytes from chronically hyperglucagonemic (glucagon injected) rats was decreased (P &lt; 0.005) to 8.76+/-0.61% compared with controls (13.20+/-0.74%) and acutely hyperglucagonemic animals (13.53+/-1.33%). The decreased binding was associated with a 70% decrease in hepatocyte cAMP response to glucagon compared with a normal response in acutely hyperglucagonemic rats.These data appear to support the concept of receptor regulation by ambient hormone level. In both endogenous and exogenous hyperglucagonemia, however, there was a disproportionately large decrease in cAMP response to glucagon compared to the decrease in glucagon binding.</AbstractText>"}

Maintenance of glucose tolerance in this setting is apparently paradoxical, suggesting increased tissue insulin sensitivity. Accordingly, forearm tissue insulin sensitivity in nine genetic prediabetic males was compared with that of seven males without familial diabetes. Diabetes was excluded in all subjects by preliminary oral glucose tolerance testing. On the preliminary 3 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) the sum of increments in blood glucose above fasting was greater in prediabetic than in control subjects. Conversely, the sum of increments in serum insulin was subnormal for the first 2 h. The insulin index (the sum of increments in insulin divided by the sum of increments in glucose) was significantly lower in prediabetics throughout the test. High physiologic levels of insulin were produced in the forearm by intrabrachial arterial insulin infusion (100 muU/kg per min for 26 min). Balances of glucose and amino acids across forearm muscle became more positive, as did balances of glucose and free fatty acids across adipose tissue plus skin. There were no differences in response between prediabetic and normal subjects.Hence, the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues is normal in genetic prediabetes. Increased tissue insulin sensitivity is not essential to explain coexisting euglycemia and insulinopenia in prediabetes because blood glucose values on the OGTT are, in fact, elevated although still within the range considered normal.</AbstractText>"}

The sucrose was given either during the day with overnight fasting (19 subjects) or as continual 3-hour meals during the day and night (seven subjects). Insulin was infused overnight in five additional subjects on the day-feeding regimen to determine the effect on triglyceride concentration. The concentration of triglyceride increased during the study in all subjects, but there was a clear diurnal pattern in the response which was present even in the continual feeding studies. The rise in triglyceride occurred mainly overnight, and during the day there was frequently a fall in the concentration. The overnight increase was significantly less when insulin was infused. There were also diurnal fluctuations in FFA and insulin in both daytime and continual feeding regimens. The plasma FFA, like triglyceride, rose during the night and fell during the day while the insulin rose during the day and fell overnight. Separate statistical analysis of the daytime and overnight changes revealed that the changes in triglyceride were significantly but negatively correlated with changes in insulin during both periods. The changes in triglyceride and FFA were positively correlated during the day but not significantly related during the night. The data show that when sucrose is eaten for 2 or 3 days, there is a general increase in triglyceride concentration upon which are superimposed major diurnal fluctuations in the concentrations of triglyceride, insulin, and FFA. It is suggested that the highly significant inverse relationship between changes in triglyceride and insulin may be mediated through an effect of insulin on triglyceride removal.</AbstractText>"}

Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was elevated in 85% of the patients studied. In 14 patients with apparently uncomplicated infarcts, LVEDP averaged 15 mm Hg, and cardiac index (2.98 liter/min/m(2)), stroke volume (38.3 ml/m(2)), and stroke work (49.2 g-m/m(2)) were within normal limits. In 12 patients with clinical signs of left ventricular failure, LVEDP averaged 29.9 mm Hg, cardiac index was at the lower limit of normal (2.79 liter/min/m(2)), but stroke volume (31.6 ml/m(2)) and stroke work (37.3 g-m/m(2)) were reduced. In 14 patients with clinical signs of shock, LVEDP averaged significantly lower than in the heart failure group (21.1 mm Hg), but cardiac index (1.59 liter/min/m(2)), stroke volume (16.5 ml/m(2)), and stroke work (11.1 g-m/m(2)) were markedly reduced. A large presystolic atrial 'kick' (average amplitude 9.5 mm Hg) was an important factor in the high LVEDP in the patients with heart failure but not in those with shock. The first derivative of left ventricular pressure was significantly lower in shock than in the nonshock group. Although right atrial pressure (RAP) and LVEDP were significantly correlated (r = 0.49), wide discrepancies in individual patients rendered the RAP an unreliable indicator of the magnitude of left ventricular filling pressure. THESE DATA SHOW THE FOLLOWING: (a) LVEDP is usually elevated in acute myocardial infarction, even in absence of clinical heart failure; (b) cardiac output apparently is supported by increased LVEDP and compensatory tachycardia; (c) in patients with shock, left ventricular function usually is markedly impaired, but inadequate compensatory cardiac dilatation or tachycardia could contribute to the reduced cardiac output in some individuals; (d) lower LVEDP in shock than in heart failure may represent differences in left ventricular compliance.</AbstractText>"}

The diagnosis was made preoperatively with the aid of plain radiographic films of the abdomen. A gangrenous distended gallbladder was removed at operation. Clostridium perfringens was cultured from the gallbladder contents and wall. If AEC is suspected, intensive antimicrobial therapy and fluid and electrolyte replacement should be given prior to early surgical intervention.</AbstractText>"}

Effects of diabetes mellitus and insulin treatment.","Journal":"Circulation research","Date":"Jun 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Vascular disease in diabetics could arise in part from altered vessel wall catebolism. Specific activities of hydrolases in aortic smooth muscle cells from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were measured. Enyzmes included: neutral alpha-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase, and lysosomal N-acetyl beta-glucosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, cathepsin C, acid alpha-glucosidase, and acid cholesteryl esterase. After 4,8, and 11 weeks of diabetes, activities of all enzymes studied were decreased significantly in diabetic vessels, decreases ranging from 15% for cathepsin C to 62% for alpha-mannosidase. After 3 weeks of diabetes, insulin treatment for 1 week restored enzyme levels to normal. After 7 weeks of diabetes, 1 week of insulin treatment did not restore enzyme levels fully to normal (acid cholesteryl esterase was unchanged); 4 weeks of insulin did. Acid phosphatase and N-acetyl beta-glucosaminidase activities were reduced markedly in histochemical studies of diabetic aortas at all time periods and were restored by insulin treatment. Alloxan-induced diabetes gave results similar to those with streptozotocin. Significant decreases of aortic hydrolase activities, including those of lysosomes, occur in experimental diabetes mellitus and could contribute to accumulation of substrates in vascular smooth muscle cells.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":4357612,"Title":"Effect of glucagon on net splanchnic cyclic AMP production in normal and diabetic men.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Jan 1974","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Glucagon activates hepatic adenylate cyclase, thereby increasing acutely the liver content of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as well as the release of cAMP into the hepatic vein. Insulin, on the other hand, antagonizes this glucagon-mediated cAMP production, thus providing a hypothetical mechanism through which insulin might correct some of the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes. To study this hormonal interaction in man, net splanchnic cAMP production (NScAMPP) was investigated in normal and insulin-dependent diabetic men under basal conditions and in response to intravenous glucagon, 50 ng/kg/min for 2 h. In normals (n=19), basal hepatic vein cAMP concentration was 23.6+/-1.1 nM and NScAMPP was 1.7+/-0.6 nmol/min. Glucagon stimulated NScAMPP in four normal subjects to a peak of 99.6+/-43 nmol/min at 25 min with a subsequent fall to 12.4+/-5.1 nmol/min by 90 min despite continuing glucagon infusion. Endogenous insulin secretion was stimulated as indicated by rising levels of immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide (connecting peptide) immunoreactivity, raising the possibility that endogenous insulin might be responsible for the fall in NScAMPP that followed the initial spike. In the diabetics (n=8), basal hepatic vein cAMP concentration was 24.7+/-1.2 nM and NScAMPP was undetectable. Glucagon stimulated NScAMPP in five diabetics to a peak of 169.9+/-42.6 with a subsequent fall to 17.4+/-3.9 nmol/min by 90 min even though endogenous insulin secretion was not stimulated (no rise in C-peptide immunoreactivity). Although the mean increase in NScAMPP was greater in the diabetics, the two groups did not differ significantly.Conclusions. In normal resting man the liver is a significant source of circulating cAMP. Diabetics do not release abnormally large amounts of hepatic cAMP under basal conditions. Glucagon markedly enhances hepatic cAMP release with a spike-decline pattern in both normal and diabetic men. The decline in hepatic cAMP release despite continuing glucagon stimulation is due to factors other than a stimulation of insulin secretion.</AbstractText>"}

The addition of each substance significantly reduced blood glucose concentration at one or more points during the GTT and generally reduced serum insulin concentrations. The greatest flattening of the glucose response was seen with guar, but this effect was abolished when hydrolysed non-viscous guar was used. The reduction in the mean peak rise in blood glucose concentration for each substance correlated positively with its viscosity (r = 0.926; P less than 0.01), as did delay in mouth-to-caecum transit time (r = 0.885; P less than 0.02). Viscous types of dietary fibre are therefore most likely to be therapeutically useful in modifying postprandial hyperglycaemia.</AbstractText>"}

In one series of 60 patients, those who stopped or reduced smoking after referral had a much improved prognosis. Thus even after the diagnosis of IC it is extremely important that patients should be encouraged to stop smoking, since this correctable factor appears to be of greater importance in determining outcome than other medical risk factors for the disease that are less amenable to treatment. In the second study, 160 patients were followed up for eight years after first hospital admission. They had a total of 480 hospital admissions and had spent 11 190 days in hospital; their life expectancy after the age of 60 was about half that of the general population.

The size of the cholate pool was significantly increased 4 days after diabetes induction. It reached a constant size three times that of control animals after 2 weeks of diabetes. Changes in bile acid pool size and secretion were directly dependent of the insulin deficiency state since they were reversed by insulin treatment and were not influenced by the caloric intake of the animal nor the pharmacologic effect of alloxan. Biliary cholate secretion was also 3-fold increased in diabetic rats and it accounted for more than 80% of the total bile acids compared to 60% in the control group. The calculated daily rate of cholate synthesis was increased in diabetic rats and the circadian rhythm of cholate synthesis was abolished in this condition. Therefore, it was shown that the negative feedback mechanism that regulates bile acid snythesis was deleted in diabetes. This mechanism was partially restored after 2 weeks of insulin treatment. These studies demonstrated that bile acid metabolism was profoundly changed in alloxan-diabetic rats and suggested that insulin may play an important role in the regulation of bile acid snythesis and intestinal absorption.</AbstractText>"}

In comparison to the normal, the diabetic collagens consistently demonstrated decreased solubility of reconstituted fibrils, marked increase in intrinsic viscosity and a decreased ratio of alpha to beta components. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed a marked decrease in migration of alpha1, alpha2, and beta components from both types of diabetic collagen. These data indicate that diabetic collagens are larger than normal and are capable of higher degrees of polymerization due to increased intra- and inter-molecular interactions. These changes could explain, in part, the altered response of diabetic connective tissues to inflammation and trauma.</AbstractText>"}

Sequential changes of metabolic intermediates in blood, liver, cerebrospinal fluid and brain after acute insulin deprivation in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat.","Journal":"The Biochemical journal","Date":"Jan 1974","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Male rats rendered diabetic by the intravenous injection of streptozotocin (150mg/kg) were treated with a long-acting insulin for 1 week, then allowed to develop ketoacidosis. By using sampling techniques designed to avoid the use of anaesthesia and extended anoxic periods, sequential measurements of metabolic intermediates were made in blood, liver, cerebrospinal fluid and brain at 24h intervals after the last insulin injection. Measurements in blood and liver suggested a rapid increase in hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and peripheral-depot lipolysis between 24 and 48h after the last insulin injection, whereas blood and liver ketone-body and triglyceride concentrations rose more slowly. The changing metabolic patterns occurring with increasing time of insulin deprivation stress the importance of sequential compared with static measurements in experimental diabetes. Data are presented for brain metabolic intermediates in diabetic ketoacidosis, and support recent evidence that glucose plays a less important role in brain oxidative metabolism in ketotic states.</AbstractText>"}

The effects of starvation and diabetes on brain fuel metabolism were examined by measuring arteriovenous differences for glucose, lactate, acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate across the brains of anaesthetized fed, starved and diabetic rats. 2. In fed animals glucose represented the sole oxidative fuel of the brain. 3. After 48h of starvation, ketone-body concentrations were about 2mm and ketone-body uptake accounted for 25% of the calculated O(2) consumption: the arteriovenous difference for glucose was not diminished, but lactate release was increased, suggesting inhibition of pyruvate oxidation. 4. In severe diabetic ketosis, induced by either streptozotocin or phlorrhizin (total blood ketone bodies &gt;7mm), the uptake of ketone bodies was further increased and accounted for 45% of the brain's oxidative metabolism, and the arteriovenous difference for glucose was decreased by one-third. The arteriovenous difference for lactate was increased significantly in the phlorrhizin-treated rats. 5. Infusion of 3-hydroxybutyrate into starved rats caused marked increases in the arteriovenous differences for lactate and both ketone bodies. 6. To study the mechanisms of these changes, steady-state concentrations of intermediates and co-factors of the glycolytic pathway were determined in freeze-blown brain. 7. Starved rats had increased concentrations of acetyl-CoA. 8. Rats with diabetic ketosis had increased concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate and decreased concentrations of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, indicating an inhibition of phosphofructokinase. 9. The concentrations of acetyl-CoA, glycogen and citrate, a potent inhibitor of phosphofructokinase, were increased in the streptozotocin-treated rats. 10. The data suggest that cerebral glucose uptake is decreased in diabetic ketoacidosis owing to inhibition of phosphofructokinase as a result of the increase in brain citrate. 11. The inhibition of brain pyruvate oxidation in starvation and diabetes can be related to the accelerated rate of ketone-body metabolism; however, we found no correlation between the decrease in glucose uptake in the diabetic state and the arteriovenous difference for ketone bodies. 12. The data also suggest that the rates of acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate utilization by brain are governed by their concentrations in plasma. 13. The finding of very low concentrations of acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate in brain compared with plasma suggests that diffusion across the blood-brain barrier may be the rate-limiting step in their metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

Sixteen patients who did not have diabetes served as controls. Attention was directed towards the presence of cytoid bodies in the nerve fiber layer of the retina (the pathological equivalent of the cotton wool spot).In paraffin embedded tissue of the diabetic group, cytoid bodies, without demonstrable vascular occlusion, was observed in 35 patients. In contrast, lipid stains of trypsin digested retina demonstrated lipid occlusion of arterioles, precapillary arterioles and/or capillaries in 29 of the 35. In 17 of the 29, lipid occlusion was also noted in gelatin embedded whole retina. Particularly striking was the observation that 10 of the 17 disclosed the presence of cytoid bodies at the same site as the lipid occluded blood vessel.This data indicates that lipid occlusion plays an important role in the production of the cotton wool spot in diabetic retinopathy. </AbstractText>"}

The clinical presentation was similar to that of juvenile diabetic microangiopathy, but in small-vessel disease there was no glucose intolerance. Unexpectedly in the patients with small-vessel disease there was no striking insulin secretion response to the stimulus of a glucose load. Controls increased their circulating insulin levels on average sixfold over fasting levels after 50 g. oral glucose: all the small-vessel-disease patients had increases of less than three times their fasting levels, and nine of them had completely flat curves throughout the test. Tolbutamide also did not stimulate insulin secretion. The refractory state of these patients' responses to the normal stimulus of insulin output has similarities to the picture in juvenile diabetes mellitus and may be important in the aetiology of the small-vessel lesions.</AbstractText>"}

In all patients, intranasal administration of DDAVP one to three times daily, usually twice daily, was found to be satisfactory in the control of diabetes insipidus. Thus, by DDAVP administration, daily urinary volume changed from 3520 +/- 2150 ml to 1620 +/- 830 ml (mean +/- SD), and urinary osmolarity changed from 126 +/- 75 mOsm/kgH2O to 446 +/- 194 mOsm/kgH2O (mean +/- SD). A daily dose of DDAVP ranged from 2.0 to 20 microgram in children (average dose 12.8 microgram), while 10 to 20 microgram of DDAVP was usually required in adult patients (average dose 14.2 microgram). No serious side effects have been observed. It is concluded that DDAVP is safe and effective in the treatment of cranial diabetes insipidus.</AbstractText>"}

In patients with the onset of diabetes after the age of 40 years, there was a significant difference between the haemoglobin A1 levels in those with diabetic retinopathy and those without complications. There was a significant association between haemoglobin A1 levels and the duration of the disease in diabetics controlled with insulin.</AbstractText>"}

During a 3-5 month observation period the subjects omitted skin preparation before insulin injection every other week. More than 1700 insulin injections were given without skin preparation. No signs of local or systemic infection were observed. These results indicate that routine skin preparation with alcohol before insulin injection markedly reduces skin bacterial-counts but may not be necessary to prevent infection at the injection sites.</AbstractText>"}

Mortality was caused by cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Obesity at issue of the policy in younger age was a greater risk than in the older age group. In prospective studies with long follow-up periods (greater than 16 years) it could be shown that obesity alone was a risk factor for coronary heart disease, the risk being greatest for men and middle aged women. However, the prevalence of accepted risk factors in an obese population is so high that the question whether obesity alone is a risk factor for coronary heart disease is of little interest. The correlations between obesity and risk factors were of minor magnitude; therefore other factors, such as age or HDL-cholesterol, should be considered in the elucidation of the relationship between obesity and coronary heart disease. HDL-cholesterol appears to be a powerful independent protective factor which is diminished in obesity. Despite the fact that studies proving a prolongation of life by treating obesity are not available, the treatment of obesity may be beneficial for the patient by diminishing risk factors.</AbstractText>"}

Parenchymal cells attach to one of its surfaces and the other is anchored to connective tissue. By its presence it defines the spatial relationships among similar and dissimilar types of cells and between these cells and the space occupied by connective and supportive tissues. Replenishment of cells which have died during normal functioning or have become damaged in course of injury occurs with new cells in an orderly way along the framework of the basal lamina scaffold. This process appears to be aided by the polarity of the basal lamina and by an apparent specificity for cell types, and it enables multicellular organisms to reconstitute histologic structures of most tissues and organs to what they were prior to loss of cells. If the basal lamina is destroyed, the healing in most tissues results in formation of scar and loss of function. The properties of the basal lamina concerned with maintenance of histologic order in organs and tissues offer new ways to interpret the pathogenesis of several common disorders, including emphysema, scars, adhesions, cirrhosis of liver and excessive accumulation of basal lamina material as, for example, it occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

There was no evidence of neurological or endocrine disease (apart from mild diabetes mellitus in the patient with carcinoma of the pancreas) but three patients suffered from severe depression. This association may be commoner than previously realized and be revealed in patients with steatorrhoea of unexplained severity by careful dietary assessment.

Water-loaded rats under ethanol anaesthesia were used to determine whether bradykinin releases ADH and whether the release is a reflex response to hypotension or the result of direct stimulation of the central nervous system by the peptide.2. Intravenous injections of bradykinin caused hypotension followed by prolonged antidiuresis; both responses were dose dependent.3. The antidiuresis caused by bradykinin could not be accounted for by hypotension alone. Haemorrhage and intravenous injections of isoprenaline, which caused falls in arterial blood pressure similar to those caused by bradykinin, produced only short-lasting antidiuretic responses.4. Intracarotid injections of bradykinin caused antidiuresis with little or no preceding hypotension. No antidiuresis was produced by intracarotid injections of isoprenaline.5. After intravenous injection of bradykinin, small amounts of ADH were identified in whole blood and, on a few occasions only, in concentrated urine. However, ADH was not detected in blood extracts.6. After intravenous injection of nicotine in doses which caused antidiureses similar to that caused by bradykinin, ADH was regularly detected in large amounts in blood extracts and in unconcentrated urine.7. Bradykinin did not cause prolonged antidiureses when injected into a rat with congenital diabetes insipidus.8. ADH release was not increased when isolated rat neural lobes were incubated with bradykinin although release was elevated by an increase in the K(+) concentration of the incubation medium.9. It is suggested that bradykinin causes release of an antidiuretic substance by a direct action on the central nervous system. The possibility that this substance is ADH is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":24683634,"Title":"Abnormal alpha cell function in diabetics response to insulin.","Journal":"Diabetes","Date":"May 1972","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The extremely high levels of glucagon recently observed in dogs with severe alloxan-induced diabetes decline promptly and precipitously to normal as soon as exogenous insulin is infused. This suggests that the normal response of the pancreatic alpha cell to hyperglycemia requires the presence of circulating insulin. To determine if the relative hyperglucagonemia of human diabetics responds similarly to insulin repletion, the plasma glucagon response of ten adult-type diabetic patients to a large, predominantly carbohydrate meal was determined with and without the simultaneous forty-five-minute intravenous infusion of glucagon free insulin (0.12 to 0.2 U./kg.). The glucagon response to the carbohydrate meal during prompt and super normal hyperinsulinemia resulting from the infusion did not differ from that of the control meal, i.e. normal suppression of glucagon by hyperglycemia was not restored by the abundance of circulating insulin.To determine if still higher plasma levels of insulin would overcome the hyposuppressibility of the diabetic alpha cell to hyperglycemia, 0.6 U. per kilogram per hour of insulin was infused at a constant rate for two hours together with 0.6 gm. per kilogram per hour of glucose to prevent hypoglycemia.Insulin levels of more than 1,200 μU. per milliliter were thus attained. Under these conditions, plasma glucagon declined from a mean preinfusion level of 97 pg./ml. (SEM ± 11) to a nadir of 75 pg./ml. (SEM ± 10) ninety minutes later. This slow, modest, statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01)decline differed strikingly from the response of eight non diabetic patients given intravenous glucose alone; in these subjects, at a comparable level of hyperglycemia, glucagon declined from a mean fasting level of 90 pg./ml. (SEM ± 8) to 57 pg./ml. (SEM ± 8) within thirty minutes, despite an insulin rise to only 46 μU./ml.It was concluded that in human diabetics the acute restoration of plasma insulin, even to supernormal levels, does not promptly restore to normal the alpha cell responsiveness to hyperglycemia. Simple insulin lack may not, therefore,adequately explain the alpha cell abnormality in human diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

On three separate occasions each received a two-hour infusion of insulin at a low dose (2.6 U/h) and a high dose (10.6 U/h) and an infusion of saline as control. The rates of production and utilisation of glucose were measured isotopically. The rate of fall of plasma glucose concentration was faster on the high-dose infusion of insulin than on the low, whereas the fall in plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, and keton bodies was the same on both insulin infusions. The mechanism whereby the two rates of insulin administration lowered plasma glucose concentration differed: during the low-dose infusion the decrease in the glucose concentration was produced entirely by a fall of hepatic glucose output, whereas during the high-dose insulin infusion the glucose concentration fell because both the rate of glucose production fell and the rate of glucose utilisation rose. In all experiments there was a direct relation between a fall in serum potassium concentration and the fall in plasma glucose concentration irrespective of the mechanism that reduced the glucose concentration.These results indicate that in uncontrolled diabetics low-dose insulin infusions lower the blood glucose concentration entirely by reducing glucose production from the liver and that the effect of insulin on potassium transport is independent of its effect on glucose uptake.</AbstractText>"}

Plasma-renin activity (P.R.A.) was low and did not rise appropriately with salt restriction and diuretic stimulation. Aldosterone levels were normal and rose with diuretic therapy. Plasma-volume, plasma dopamine beta-hydroxylase, urinary catecholamines, metanephrines, and vanillyl mandelic acid (V.M.A) were normal. Treatment with indomethacin (75-150 mg/day) raised the upright blood-pressure (B.P.) by an average of 20-30 mm Hg diastolic and allowed the four patients with I.O.H. to walk about without orthostatic symptoms but it had no effect in the fifth patient. When indomethacin was discontinued in one patient who had been taking it for 9 months with symptomatic relief, the B.P. fell to pretreatment levels within 48 h. When indomethacin was reinstituted the B.P. rose again. Indomethacin was more effective in these patients than either propranolol or fludrocortisone. There may be an absolute or relative excess of certain vasodepressor prostaglandins in the peripheral vessels which results in pooling of blood and orthostatic hypotension. If this is the case indomethacin might improve the orthostatic symptoms of I.O.H. by its inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis, but its mechanism of action remains to be determined.</AbstractText>"}

The treatment regimen was then continued without biguanides for 3 weeks and the exercise test was repeated at the end of this period. All 3 biguanide preparations induce hyperlactaemia in diabetics. Physical stress leads to an additional increase in lactate, which reaches pathological proportions. Discontinuation of biguanide treatment leads to a significant decrease in resting and stress values. In a comparison of the 3 biguanide products, phenformin induced significantly higher lactate values in response to exercise than buformin. Of the biguanides, phenformin appears to carry the greatest risk of causing hyperlactaemia in susceptible patients, induced by concurrent circumstances, with progression to severe lacticate acidosis. The special pharmacokinetic properties of phenformin and the 8-fold higher incidence of lacticate acidosis than under buformin or metformin therapy support this observation.</AbstractText>"}

Lung maturity was determined by four different methods, analyzing the concentration of surfactant in amniotic fluid L/S ratio was measured planimetrically and densitometrically, foam test and surface tension of the liquor amnii were used on this purpose. 89 normal pregnancies for obtaining normal values served as a basis for comparison with pathological events. A general retardation of fetal lung maturity showed 26 patients with rhesus isoimmunization so as 26 patients with diabetes classes A, B and C (White). In three pregnancies complicated by diabetes class D a remarkable acceleration of fetal lung maturity was obvious. 30 patients with placental insufficiency sui generis presented a very inhomogenous development of the fetal lung, whereas in 35 patients with EPH-gestosis a minute acceleration between 33th and 37th week of gestation was found. A good correlation between all of the used methods for measuring the concentration of surfactant was noted. Best reliability in correct prediction of lung maturity showed the method of measuring the surface-tension of the amniotic fluid.</AbstractText>"}

The renal plasma flow is affected to a considerably more restricted extent. The combination of diabetic nephropathy with chronic pyelonephritis, found in 10 patients, does not affect substantially the mentioned functions of the kidney, but additional investigations were considered necessary in that field. Bilateral symmetric alterations are more frequently the secretory and excretory segmentsmthe establishment of unilateral alterations may speak of the presence of chronic pyelonephritis of uropathic character.

Although differences in body weight between the homozygous DI and heterozygous normal rats accounted for differences in the weights of the heart and gonads, the weights of the spleen, liver and kidney were not solely body-weight dependent; there were significant sex and genotype differences in the mean weights of these organs. The liver, heart and gonads were the only organs showing age-dependent changes. No genotype-dependent differences were observed in the haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration, although there was a sex difference; the mean values of these parameters were higher in males. Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower in homozygous than in heterozygous rats; in the latter, plasma glucose concentration decreased with age. No significant changes occurred in the mean plasma concentrations of sodium or potassium with age or genotype. Total plasma lipids of heterozygous female rats showed both age- and genotype-dependent changes; this parameter reached a plateau at 90-100 weeks old, and was significantly higher in heterozygous females than in all other groups. Plasma proteins showed no age-dependent changes, but were of higher mean value in heterozygous than in homozygous rats and were greater in females than in males. Differences in blood parameters of homozygous and heterozygous Brattleboro rats are discussed in terms of differences in hormone concentrations.</AbstractText>"}

Fibrillary structures were seen in larger deposits of such material. This material was only observed in biopsies fixed directly with osmium tetroxide; initial fixation with glutaraldehyde did not retain the material and left empty spaces. Positive immuno-histochemical reaction with specific antibodies demonstrated that the extracellular material contained growth hormone (GH). The presence of this extracellular material could not be related to the age or sex of the patient nor to the duration of symptoms, size of the tumor, presence of diabetes mellitus, or concomitant secretion of prolactin. The pericapillary fibrous sheath was heavily thickened in the patient with the longest duration of symptoms, intermediate in thickness in the second and normal in the third.</AbstractText>"}

Hypertrophic babies are born more frequently to mothers with manifest diabetes than to those with gestation diabetes. In mothers with the long-lasting disease accompanied by vascular lesions, retardation of the intrauterine fetal growth may occur. In order to improve the condition of these infants, their mothers should be constantly supervised during pregnancy and they should be prescribed adequate diet and therapy. Diabetic mothers also require greater care at delivery and a more liberal attitude towards the application of the cesarean section in order to prevent hypoxia and obstetric traumas of the infant.</AbstractText>"}

Terminal latencies and MNCV along the distal segment (knee to ankle) of the nerve were also estimated with the conventional M-response technique. This article describes another method for estimating sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) along 1a fibers of the tibial nerve for the spinal cord-to-knee segment. Proximal and distal MNCV showed moderate slowing in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and severe slowing in those with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In 17 control subjects, proximal MNCV for the axons supplying the abductor hallucis muscle was compared to that estimated for the axons to the gastrocnemius muscle. MNCV for the proximal is faster than that for the distal small muscle. In 2 patients, M- and F-responses were not obtained from the abductor hallucis; in these patients, effective estimation of the proximal MNCV was made from the gastrocnemius muscle and showed marked reduction.</AbstractText>"}

ATP and AMP levels are unchanged 8 and 24 hours after alloxan administration but the former is increased and the latter decreased 48 hours posttreatment. Insulin given to rats 8 hours after alloxan treatment reverses glycogen, FDP, triose phosphates, pyruvate and lactate levels seen in the diabetic rat brain. In addition the increament in glucose is reduced by half and the rate of anaerobic lactate formation from glycogen is restored to control values. G-6-P levels, unaffected by alloxan or insulin alone, are significantly lowered in animals which received insulin after alloxan. Phosphorylase, HK, PFK, ALD, GAPDH, PK, LDH and Glycogen synthetase activities are not modified in rat brain by administration of alloxan or insulin or both.</AbstractText>"}

DDAVP was applicated in 1--3 intranasal doses daily. The dosage varied between 7--42 microgram/24 h. The diuresis before the treatment ranged between 28,000--7,600 ml/24 h (mean 13,883 ml/24 h) and was decreased by DDAVP below 2000 ml/24 h in 21 patients (70%) and to 2000--4000 ml/24 h in 8 patients (26.6%). In a single case it was not possible to reduce the diuresis from 20,000 ml below 8,000 ml/24 h. Favourable properties of DDAVP: absence of reduction of potency, lack of important side-effects and prolonged action were not lost even in the course of the long term treatment. No harmful effects of DDAVP were noted. Blood count as well as renal function tests were not affected by the treatment. All the patients preferred DDAVP to their previous therapy.</AbstractText>"}

The glucose disappearance rate had improved in the majority of the subjects, but only three had attained values in the normal range. Concomitants of the undue hyperglycemia and/or obesity included labile and, rarely, sustained hypertension and/or cardiomegaly. The blood pressure returned to normal but heart size did not change. Electrocardiographic abnormalities noted in about one-half of the patients persisted after the operation. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased. No patients had diabetic retinopathy visible on funduscopy. Proteinuria did not change in three patients. Neuropathy consisting of absent ankle reflexes and/or decreased vibration perception noted in one-half of the subjects persisted despite the improvement in carbohydrate metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

These include pregnant patients, anephric patients, patients undergoing weight reduction, patients with altered renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, and patients in whom diabetic regulation is difficult. Patients monitored home blood glucose continually (on a daily basis), intermittently, or only for particular problems or symptoms. Such monitoring can be practically accomplished in a manner acceptable to patients. Motivation, compliance with protocol, and an understanding of the objectives of the program are essential on the part of the patient. Home blood glucose monitoring, however, can provide an insight diabetes regulation that cannot be attained in any other way and can greatly facilitate regulation of diabetes. Such home blood glucose monitoring may increase the likelihood of achievement of a degree of control approximating euglycemia.</AbstractText>"}

The results were compared with the patients' previous and actual smoking habits. Cigarette smoking was defined as daily smoking of at least ten cigarettes for one year or more. Smoking habits of the total diabetic sample were not significantly different from those of a nondiabetic control sample. However, a decline in the number of cigarette smokers and a rising number of ex-smokers were noted with increasing duration of diabetes. In comparing smokers and nonsmokers, no difference was found in the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy, background retinopathy, and proliferative retinopathy. However, the prevalence of nephropathy (persistent proteinuria) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) among these patients who were or had been cigarette smokers. Thus, cigarette smoking might be considered a risk factor for the development of diabetic nephropathy.</AbstractText>"}

The results obtained indicate that in brain of diabetic animals glutaminesynthetase activity of microsomal fractions is changed very slightly while that of the soluble fraction is marked reduced. In liver tissue enzyme activity is significantly decreased in both microsomal and soluble fractions. In homogenates of brain tissue of diabetic animals glutaminase does not differ markedly from that of control animals both in the presence and absence of activators (phosphate, aspartate, bicarbonate). In homogenates of liver, in the absence of activators, glutaminase activity is greater in diabetic animals than in controls, it is not much changed in the presence of phosphate and decreases in the presence of bicarbonate and aspartate. In diabetic animals, in the presence of phosphate, glutaminase activity of brain mitochondrial fractions increases while that of liver mitochondrial fractions does not change. It is interesting to note that in the absence of activators glutaminase activity is absent in both brain and liver mitochondria while it is quite high in homogenates.</AbstractText>"}

Vomiting was a common factor, and in all carbohydrate reduction occurred with continued or increased daily insulin dose. Treatment comprised fluid and electrolyte replacement and large doses of insulin covered by adequate carbohydrate, many receiving 10% dextrose.

In this preparation, insulin was trapped in oil droplets of oleic acid in glyceryl-alpha-monooleate. (1) W/O/W insulin micelles were absorbed from the ligated jejunal loop of rabbits to the order of 12.3 to 58.5% of the dose given (10 mU/kg body weight) during the 3-h experimental period. (2) Alloxan diabetic rats were treated with intrajejunal administration of W/O/W insulin micelles at a dosage of either 25 or 50 mU/100 g body weight, three times daily for as long as 14 days. During treatment, a significant reduction in the daily excretion of urinary glucose was observed, concomitant with a decrease in fasting blood glucose. Quantitative estimates suggested that the effectiveness of 25 mU/100 g of intrajejunal W/O/W insulin micelles was comparable to that of regular insulin at a dosage of 1 mU/100 g i.m.

These expressions provide arithmetic and graphical solutions for obtaining distributions of membrane thickness and reciprocal membrane thickness from empirical distributions of intercept lengths. Furthermore, general relationships between probability density functions of distributions of intercept length and membrane thickness are derived as well as those between their moments. Examples of the application of the method to biological samples are given, and estimated distributions of glomerular basement membrane thickness are compared to those obtained by an independent, direct method. Various sources of bias, which in practice may occur due to departures from the sample model, are discussed and the influence of some of them is estimated. The knowledge of the probability density function of reciprocal intercepts makes it possible to perform a correction of the distribution of measured intercept length, which to some extent eliminates bias.</AbstractText>"}

Questions remain concerning the clinical acceptance that osmometry will achieve in veterinary medicine. Many practices may not be able to justify the purchase of an osmometer; however, osmometers are available at most medical centers and clinical laboratories. In an era when serum chemistry profiles are being used more frequently, it may prove that serum osmolatity will be requested more frequently. Determination of osmolality is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive test that has potential in screening for disorders of body fluids. Several research laboratories utilize osmometry routinely in screening for potential fluid or electrolyte inbalances. When coupled with glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolyte values, a comparison of calculated and measured osmolality allows further clinical interpretations. Differences may exist between calculated and measured osmolality. In some instances, determination of calculated osmolality alone may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the true status of body fluids. Specialized intensive care practices should certainly consider the value of osmometry in monitoring patients undergoing extensive fluid therapy. Last, but not least, osmometry does provide the best measure of renal concentrating ability and is of particular value in evaluation of polyuric and proteinuric patients.</AbstractText>"}

In the male group arteriosclerosis in the extracranial cerebral arteries was demonstrated in 90% of these examined by angiography. In the female group factors recognized as interfering with the coagulation system were obvious in more than 70% and two women had fibromuscular dysplasia. These differences may have therapeutic and prognostic implications. In the total material only 35% had hypertension. Diabetes was not present in any of the patients. Of the men 46.6% had abnormal blood lipids against 15.4% of the women. Seventy-five percent of the patients with verified arteriosclerosis were regular smokers.

Maximum intrahepatic deposition of radioxenon occurred during the washout phase of the study. In addition to those clinical instances which make this phenomenon possible, i.e., obesity, alcoholic-induced liver steatosis and diabetes mellitus, we found that hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease also favor xenon-133 localization into the hepatic parenchyma. It is concluded that the lipid avidity of 133Xe facilitates its liver accumulation hyperlipidemic patients and in patients with coronary artery disease, and that this action may be explored to further understand deranged metabolic pathways in the liver of these patients. Hepatic accumulation of 133Xe during ventilation studies must be considered when assessing regional ventilation/perfusion relationships.</AbstractText>"}

We obtained the following results. (1) In normal subjects, the sweat chloride concentration was inclined to rise gradually with age from childhood to adulthood; the mean value of sweat chloride concentration was 30.0 mEq/liter in adults from 20 years old, and the upper limit was about 60 mEq/liter. (2) The mean value of sweat chloride concentration was 60.0 mEq/liter in chronic calcifying pancreatitis; this value was markedly higher than that of control subjects of the same age (p is less than 0.001). (3) The mean value of sweat chloride concentration in cholelithiasis, peptic ulcer and hepatic diseases did not differ significantly from control subjects. The mean value of sweat chloride concentration in diabetes mellitus was significantly higher than that of control subjects (p is less than 0.01), but was significantly lower than that in chronic pancreatitis (p is less than 0.01). (4) It was supposed that some cases of chronic pancreatitis have a congenital disposition toward abnormal secretion of sweat glands and epithelium in the pancreatic duct, resembling cystic fibrosis, and this disposition leads easily to pancreatic disorders when the individual is exposed to various external factors.</AbstractText>"}

Total serum protein and hematocrit provide a rough estimate of reduction in circulating blood volume, but calculation from these data will usually underestimate the deficit. Determination of urea nitrogen concentration helps to detect reduced glomerular filtration rate. Acid-base disturbances, most commonly metabolic acidosis, are detected by measuring pH and CO2 content (or base excess). Blood glucose should be measured to rule out diabetes mellitus, even in the absence of a suggestive history. Determination of potassium in serum is most important in the diagnosis of adrenal or renal insufficiency and in the post-acidotic phase after dehydration. Osmolality of body fluids is estimated by measuring [Na+]. Since osmolality of body fluids is normally maintained at the expense of fluid volume by the kidney and the hormones governing renal excretion of water and sodium, abnormal osmolality indicates a serious condition which has to be interpreted with the help of clinical data. In cases of abnormal renal function or of abnormal losses, as with removal of gastrointestinal fluids by suction, or excessive and prolonged diarrhea, measuring volume and composition of excreta may be essential. Because of cumulative deficits, patients with prolonged losses or inability to regulate oral intake by thirst cannot be treated without continual careful interpretation of the reports from a good laboratory.</AbstractText>"}

[(3)H]Tryptophan was initially incorporated into acid-ethanol-extractable protein, which on gel filtration was eluted with a molecular weight of about 9000 and contained a small amount of glucagon immunoreactivity. With longer incubation [(3)H]tryptophan incorporation into a second peak was obtained in an identical position with that of the majority of rat glucagon immunoreactivity. This peak of labelled protein exhibited migration characteristics on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis identical with those of rat glucagon and was identified as newly synthesized glucagon by demonstration of specific binding and dissociation behaviour with glucagon antibodies. The incorporation of [(3)H]tryptophan into acid-ethanol-extractable protein was inhibited by cycloheximide. High concentrations of glucose increased [(3)H]tryptophan incorporation into high-molecular-weight protein but decreased incorporation into proteins smaller than cytochrome c. The pattern of [(3)H]leucine incorporation into protein was similar to that of [(3)H]tryptophan.</AbstractText>"}

Such studies cannot, however, isolate which of the dietary or nondietary characteristics of affluence help to cause the disease; they provide only clues that need to be subjected to experimental study. Experiments should be designed on the basis of their ability to produce the multiple abnormalties associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and not only hypercholesterolemia. They should also explain the association of CHD with obesity, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and physical inactivity. These considerations suggest that the underlying abnormality that produces CHD is a disturbed hormonal balance. Experiments have shown that a high consumption of sucrose produces not only the wide range of abnormalities seen in CHD but also an increased blood concentration of insulin and cortisol. Since a low intake of sucrose confers many other health benefits, it is a more logical dietary recommendation than that of substituting polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat.</AbstractText>"}

The utilization of some metabolic fuels has been measured in vitro in a preparation of rat jejunum to which the substrates were supplied via the perfusate flowing through the vascular bed. 2. In jejunum from 48 hr-fasted rats, the combined rates of utilization of 1 mM-acetoacetate and 2mM-D-3-hydroxybutyrate are similar to that of 7.5 mM-glucose. 3. The utilization of glucose is reduced in jejunum from animals fasted for 48 hr (45--63% reduction) and also from animals after 3--6 days of diabetes induced by streptozotocin (29% reduction). The addition of ketone bodies or of Na-oleate to the vascular perfusate does not reduce the utilization of glucose by the jejunum of either fed or 48 hr fasted rats. 4. Ketone bodies in the vascular perfusate reduce the oxidation of glucose by the jejunum of fed rats. In the jejunum of 48 hr-fasted rats, ketone bodies completely inhibit the oxidation of glucose so that all the glucose utilized by the tissue is converted to lactate. 5. The findings are discussed in relation to other work and it is concluded that substrates for the oxidative metabolism of the jejunum of fasted rats are likely to be ketone bodies, glutamine and fatty acids; at the same time the utilization of glucose is reduced and its oxidation completely abolished.</AbstractText>"}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether hepatic mitochondria of guinea-pigs with spontaneous diabetes mellitus differ from those of non-diabetic guinea-pigs in the oxidation of fatty acids, the activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, or respiration-linked oxidative phosphorylation. During the course of the study, a third group of animals (referred to as the unclassified group) was discovered which, on the basis of the clinical chemistry and histological changes in the pancreas, appeared to be in a pre-diabetic or post-diabetic state. 2. No differences in the respiratory control ratios were found between any of the three groups. Fatty-acid oxidation in hepatic mitochondria was greater in both the unclassified and diabetic groups than in the non-diabetic group. Beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, however, was increased only in the diabetic group. These findings suggest that increased fatty acid oxidation is probably an intermediate change in the development of or the recovery from diabetes mellitus, whereas the activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is affected only in more advanced stages.</AbstractText>"}

Promotion of carcinogenesis and gain in body weight are independent phenomena caused by castration in the medicated rats. Growth hormone is most effective in enhancing body weight in all animals, but least as regards tumour formation. It reduces the incidence of sarcomas in intacts, but raises that of epithelial neoplasms, and promotes both types of neoplasms in castrates. The highest incidence of cervico-vaginal epithelial and sarcomatous tumours occurs in spayed diabetics.Squamous celled epitheliomas of the vulva are not affected by castration or additional medication, while basal celled neoplasms tend to be more frequent in intacts than in castrates and particularly numerous in intact failed diabetics. Vulval sarcomas are usually rare but are increased in numbers in diabetic and in insulin treated intacts.Granular myoblastomas of the cervico-vaginal tract occur in intacts only and particularly in diabetics and those medicated with growth hormone or insulin.</AbstractText>"}

Raised amylase levels were found in 34 patients and probably reflected a mild acute pancreatitis. The high amylase levels correlated with low arterial PO(2) levels and significantly with high arterial PCO(2) levels and the base deficit but not with the severity or duration of the hypothermia. The acute pancreatitis does not explain why hypothermic patients with myxoedema have a poorer prognosis than those who are euthyroid. The pancreatitis occasionally contributed to the development, sometimes delayed, of diabetic ketoacidosis, blood glucose levels of over 120 mg/100 ml being found in 20 patients. There was a significant correlation between the raised serum amylase levels and the hyperglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia, sometimes profound, was found in 12 patients.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":4341501,"Title":"Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: in vivo and in vitro studies.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"May 1972","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The physiological basis for the polyuria and polydipsia occurring in some manic-depressive patients treated with lithium salts was studied in vivo and in vitro. Three lithium-treated polyuric patients, in whom other causes of a concentrating defect were excluded, had abnormal urinary concentrating abilities after a standard water depreviation test. Two of these patients failed to respond to exogenous vasopressin (ADH) and one had a subnormal response. The abilities of these patients to excrete solute-free water (C(H2O)) was comparable to normal subjects during steady-state water diuresis, suggesting no gross abnormalities in sodium transport. However, each of these patients demonstrated abnormally low capacities to reabsorb solute-free water (T(C) (H2O)) under hydropenic conditions after administration of hypertonic saline and vasopressin. These in vivo findings demonstrate at least a nephrogenic basis for the diabetes insipidus syndrome manifested by these three patients. The defect in water transport was further characterized in toad urinary bladders in vitro. Short-circuit current (I) and water flow (W) were studied under basal, ADH-stimulated, and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (c-AMP)-stimulated conditions. Increasing mucosal [Li(+)] progressively inhibited basal I, and both I and W induced by ADH. Significant inhibition of basal and ADH-induced I was observed at mucosal [Li(+)] &lt; 1.1 mEq/liter, and of ADH-induced W at mucosal [Li(+)] = 11 mEq/liter. On the other hand, at these lithium concentrations, neither c-AMP-stimulated W nor I was inhibited. Increasing serosal [Li(+)] produced significant inhibition of basal I only at [Li(+)] at least 50-fold greater than at the mucosal (urinary) surface. These in vitro studies confirm that mucosal lithium inhibits the action of ADH, but not c-AMP. Hence, lithium appears to be a significant inhibitor of ADH-stimulated water flow, probably acts from the urinary surface, and appears to exert its effect at a site biochemically proximal to c-AMP action.</AbstractText>"}

However, a statistically significant difference (P&lt;0·05 to P&lt;0·01) between subjects was noted by grouping them by age: the older the subject, the longer the persistence of sensory response and the less marked the slowing in conduction velocity. The mechanism of the phenomenon has been discussed in relation to a similar longer resistance to ischaemia found in peripheral nerves of diabetic and uraemic patients.</AbstractText>"}

Content of free fatty acids was also increased in kidney cortex of diabetic rats within 72 hrs after administration of alloxan. Alterations in content of free fatty acids were not observed either in kidney of diabetic animals within other studied periods (6 and 14-16 days) of treatment or in the tissue of starved rats.

A 64-year-old lady had complained of visual disturbance for 4 years. She was operated upon under the diagnosis of tuberculum sellae meningioma. Sever days following operation tremendous polyuria was senn, i. e. polyuria over 40 l/day, massive sodium wasting in the urine, hyponatremia and severe thirst feeling. These situations could not easily controlled by pitressin, and 2 days after the onset of polyuria the level of sodium in the serum decreased up to 112 mEq/l, the amount of excretion of sodium into urine increased up to 186 mEq/l, and the patient had finally a convulsive seizure followed by loss of consciousness. This hyponatremia was easily controlled by infusion of hypertonic NaCl. The pathogenesis of this condition could not be explained by applying the classical concept of 'Diabetes Insipidus' nor 'SIADH'. This hyponatremia might be the result of massive sodium wasting in the urine. And from the results obtained in our patient, these conditions should be classified in the syndrome of 'Cerebral Polyuric Hyponatremia' as reported by Oi et al. It should be emphasized that the measurement of osmorality and level of electrolytes in the serum and urine had to be performed frequently when the postoperative polyuric situation was found, so that the clinical diagnosis could be established in the earlier stage. The clinical diagnosis and differentiation of postoperative disorders in water and electrolytes of central origin were discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Mortality experience since 1915 has been examined in 5655 Boston firefighters, comprising all male members of the city fire department with three or more years of service. The observed cause of death as stated on the death certificates of 2470 deceased firefighters has been compared with the numbers expected based on rates for the male population of Massachusetts and of the United States of America. Among all firefighters, deaths from all causes were 91% of expected. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was markedly reduced (less than 50) for infectious disease, diabetes, rheumatic heart disease, chronic nephritis, blood diseases and suicide. The SMR was 86 for cardiovascular deaths, 83 for neoplastic deaths, and 93 for respiratory deaths. The SMR for accidents was 135 for active firefighters. The results suggest that the survival experience of firefighters is strongly influenced by strict entry selection procedures, ethnic derivation, and sociocultural attributes of membership. While excessive morbidity has been demonstrated in firefighters, there does not appear to be a strong association between occupation and cause-specific mortality.</AbstractText>"}

Effect of diet and duration of insulin deficiency.","Journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","Date":"Nov 1974","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A combined ultrastructural and functional approach was employed to define the effects of duration of diabetes and of diet on various aspects of lipid metabolism in rats with severe streptozotocin (SZ)-induced insulin deficiency. Plasma triglyceride (TG) levels rose to a mean of 479 mg/100 ml 24 h after SZ administration in rats eating a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet as compared to a mean of 324 mg/100 ml in rats eating a high fat diet. These changes were associated with a commensurate increase in hepatocyte Golgi very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) content, but only a small increase in estimates of VLDL-TG secretion rate (post-Triton WR 1339 increment in plasma TG level). Although these findings are consistent with the thesis that VLDL-TG synthesis and secretion are increased 24 h after administration of SZ, it seemed unlikely that the observed increase in VLDL-TG secretion could entirely account for the severity of the hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, although lipoprotein removal rate was not measured directly, it was necessary to postulate that a defect in VLDL-TG removal was also present at this stage. Hypertriglyceridemia was still present 7 days later, only in this instance plasma TG levels were higher in rats eating the high fat diet (a mean of 589 mg/100 ml, as compared to 263 mg/100 ml). Rats with diabetes of 7-day duration had a 50% decrease in both TG entry rate and hepatocyte Golgi complex VLDL content, irrespective of diet. Thus, there was no evidence of increased VLDL-TG secretion in chronic insulin deficiency. In this instance, although not assessed directly, it was necessary to postulate that the hypertriglyceridemia in chronically insulin-deficient rats is due entirely to a defect in lipoprotein removal, involving both dietary and endogenous fat.</AbstractText>"}

Bleeding from oesophagogastric varices after blockage of the shunt was responsible for at least half of the early postoperative deaths, and most late deaths were due to liver failure. A decreased chance of late survival was associated with age over 40 years, active chronic hepatitis, and with a preoperative history of hepatocellular jaundice.Shunt blockage occurred in 16% of patients, and all bled again from oesophagogastric varices. Shunt block is more likely if the portal vein is calcified or thrombosed, and may be more likely if the portal vein diameter, as shown by splenic venography, is 1.5 cm or less.In survivors with a patent shunt the most serious late complication was chronic, severe portal-systemic encephalopathy, which occurred in 38%. Severe encephalopathy was associated with age over 40 years, a preoperative history of any degree of encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and with continued drinking in the alcoholic. Most patients who had portal-systemic encephalopathy in the first year postoperatively developed chronic disabling encephalopathy.A preoperative history of transient mild or moderate ascites did not seem adversely to influence the outcome.</AbstractText>"}

Insulin deficiency induced by anti-insulin serum or streptozotocin increased glucose absorption, as measured in everted sacs of rat upper ileum incubated for 30 min with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium.2. Everted sacs prepared from the terminal ileum of insulin-deficient rats were able to accumulate glucose against a concentration gradient (i.e. development of active glucose transport).3. In experimental diabetes induced by streptozotocin, everted sacs of upper ileum showed increased 3-methyl glucose active transport, and sacs of terminal ileum showed development of 3-methyl glucose active transport.4. Lactic acid formation during the absorption of both glucose and 3-methyl glucose was increased approximately twofold in everted sacs of insulin-deficient animals.5. Insulin added at 100 mu./ml. to the incubating media of everted sacs prepared from insulin-deficient rats did not result in a reduction of glucose absorption or reverse the other effects.6. Fluoride (5 x 10(-3)M) added to the serosal and mucosal media of sacs of terminal ileum prepared from insulin-deficient rats decreased [(14)C]CO(2) formation from [U-(14)C]glucose and lactate formation during glucose absorption, but was unable to reverse the effect of insulin deficiency on glucose active transport.7. The effects of insulin deficiency induced by streptozotocin were more striking than those induced by anti-insulin serum.8. Everted sacs prepared from rats starved for 3 days showed increased glucose active transport accompanied by diminished conversion of [U-(14)C]glucose to [(14)C]CO(2).9. The possible role of hexokinase is discussed in relation to these findings.</AbstractText>"}

Patients with a minimal background retinopathy show a slight increase in retinal blood flow, whereas an highly significant increase of segmental blood flow is observed in the more advanced stages of background retinopathy with maculopathy. In general, a good correlation is apparent between the progressions of diabetic background retinopathy and increase in retinal blood flow. On the other hand, patients with proliferative retinopathy show lower values of retinal blood flow, which are attributable to a marked decrease in arterial diameter.</AbstractText>"}

While urea and nitrogen correlated significantly with each other in both normal and diabetic subjects, the relationship between UN/TN and protein intake was quite different in the two groups. Nondiabetic patients exhibited generally close correlation between UN/TN and protein intake with statistically significant correlation coefficients (r = 0.74-0.99) in 11 of 12 subjects. In none of the 10 diabetic patients, however, was significant correlation found. While the reliability of the index in diabetic patients tended to improve as hyperglycemia lessened, even under conditions considered clinically to indicate excellent metabolic control (mean plasma glucose less than or equal to 125 mg/dl), UN/TN still did not correlate significantly with protein intake. These observations suggest that the unstable carbohydrate metabolism characteristic of diabetes mellitus may be responsible for altered protein retention during pregnancy. From a clinical point of view, the utility of urinary urea studies as a simple and objective index of protein intake in the normal pregnant women does not apply in the diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

Possible mechanisms of exercise induced albuminuria in diabetics were also investigated. Under ordinary conditions of life the insulin-treated diabetics, as a group, had a higher mean urinary albumin excretion than normal controls; however, half of the diabetics had albumin excretion rates within the control range. A given exercise load (600 kpm/min for 20 min) produced an exaggerated albumin excretion in diabetics, particularly evident in the post-exercise period. The elevated urinary albumin excretion was due to an increased transglomerular passage of albumin, not to reduced tubular reabsorption. The increase was not associated with differences in blood pressure or urine flow between controls and diabetics. This exercise test has proved to be a suitable provocation test to unmask abnormalities in the glomerular handling of albumin that might not be recognisable at rest.</AbstractText>"}

Its value lies in the possibility of subsequent counterstaining and thus of revealing the structural relationships of amyloid. In the kidney the topical disposition of amyloid closely resembles the disposition of fibrin in the kidney of diabetics; this suggests that upset in vascular permeability plays a part in determining the site of the amyloid deposits. Furthermore, an aging process in amyloid can now be envisaged resembling the aging of extraluminal fibrin. Both materials proceed to a hyalin material that, staining like collagen, merits the name pseudo-collagen. This term we apply to a hyalin, staining like collagen, for which, we can postulate a specific precursor.</AbstractText>"}

'High' glucose media enhanced proliferation of fibroblasts, with an 'optimal' response at about 18 mM (325 mg./dl.). Equimolar sorbitol gave similar results, with the greatest increase in proliferation occurring at about the same concentration as for glucose (1 mM). Since neither equimolar mannitol nor sucrose produced such effects consistently, these results cannot be explained solely on the basis of hyperosmolarity. In contrast, arterial smooth-muscle cells failed to show a consistent growth response in the presence of either added glucose or sorbitol. These results suggest that studies with cultured human cells may be useful in assessment of responses to components of the disordered metabolic milieu of diabetes. Such studies of arterial smooth-muscle cells should also be useful for investigation of the mechanism of atherosclerosis in diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The hyperglycemic response to neurotensin was partially blocked by the histamine H-1 receptor blockers, diphenhydramine and promethazine, and by the H-2 receptor blocker, cimetidine. The hyperglucagonemic response was completely blocked by diphenhydramine and promethazine and only partially blocked by cimetidine. The effects of histamine on glucose, glucagon, and insulin secretion were similar to those of neurotensin, and the inhibitory effects of both H-1 and H-2 blockers were comparable. The stimulatory effect of histamine on insulin secretion observed after adrenal autotransplantation was also similar to that previously reported for neurotensin. Neither antineurotensin serum nor diphenhydramine, however, was effective in blocking the hyperglycemic and hyperglucagonemic responses to the central administration of 2-deoxyglucose. The results are consistent with a histamine mediation of the effects of exogenously administered neurotensin but do not support a proposed role for neurotensin or histamine in the mediation of the hyperglycemic and hyperglucagonemic responses to central glucopenia.</AbstractText>"}

Glucose removal following intravenous glucose was significantly (p is less than 0.001) decreased in uremic rats compared with sham-operated rats (k = 2.1 +/- 0.03 per cent vs. 5.1 +/- 0.2 per cent). This deterioration in glucose tolerance was associated with higher insulin levels in uremic rats from one to 40 minutes after glucose administration, suggesting that insulin resistance accounted for the decrease in glucose removal by uremic rats. To identify the site of the insulin resistance, we compared the ability of insulin to enhance net glucose uptake by isolated perfused liver and muscle (hindlimb) preparations obtained from uremic and sham-operated rats. Insulin suppressed glucose outflow from perfused livers of uremic rats at least as well as it did from livers of sham-operated rats, and suppression occurred at both maximal ( greater than 600 micromicron./ml.) and threshold (75 micromicron./ml.) perfusate insulin levels. In contrast, there was a significant decrease in the ability of insulin (mean perfusate level = 225 micromicron./ml.) to enhance glucose uptake of perfused hindlimbs of uremic as compared with sham-operated rats. These results suggest that the insulin resistance of acute uremia may be due primarily to decreased insulin-mediated uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle without any decrease in sensitivity of the liver to insulin.</AbstractText>"}

For comparison, serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and total cholesterol were also measured in normal subjects and hyperthyroid patients. Although serum T4 concentration remained unchanged, serum T3 concentration decreased significantly in an elderly group of normal subjects. Similarly, serum T4 did not change with age and serum T3 decreased slightly but progressively with age in hyperthyroid patients. In addition, serum total cholesterol concentration increased progressively with age in normal subjects. Oral glucose tolerance decreased with age in normal subjects despite the same timing, peak level attained, and total magnitude of insulin response for old and young subjects. Although the severity of hyperthyroidism decreases with age, age-related glucose intolerance was much more apparent in hyperthyroid patients because of the age-related decrease of basal concentration, the peak level attained, and the total magnitude of insulin response. It is suggested that age-related glucose intolerance is magnified by the hyperthyroid state.</AbstractText>"}

Compared with control incubations at pH 7.4, binding was reduced by 19 per cent at pH 7.1 and by 48 per cent at pH 6.8. Addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate, at concentrations similar to those seen clinically, 'restored' insulin binding toward normal. We suggest that, by counteracting the effects of acidosis, ketoacids themselves maintain normal insulin-receptor binding in diabetic ketoacidosis. These data also illustrate that small molecules, present in vivo, can significantly alter the interactions between a hormone and its receptor in vitro.</AbstractText>"}

Biochemical studies showed placental villi to specifically bind 125I-insulin. Radioautographic studies showed the specific binding to be localized to the surface of the syncytial trophoblast. Topographic distribution of insulin binding was determined with ferritin-insulin. Initial studies using ferritin-insulin containing some oligomers of ferritin revealed the insulin receptors to be specifically associated with the glycocalyx region of the surface membranes of microvilli. No insulin receptors were detectable in association with the intermicrovillous plasma membrane even though its glycocalyx is in direct continuity with the glycocalyx of microvilli. Monomeric ferritin-insulin showed the same nonuniform distribution of the insulin receptor, which suggests that there is not complete freedom of lateral mobility of the insulin receptors in the surface membrane of this tissue. The insulin receptors were found to occur as singletons or in groups of two or more. Incubations with monomeric ferritin-insulin at 4 degrees or with tissue prefixed with formaldehyde showed that the groups of insulin receptors were naturally occurring, i.e., they are present prior to and independent of insulin binding and thus not secondary to ligand-induced aggregation. The physiologic meaning of the nonuniform distribution and the groups of insulin receptors is unclear at present.</AbstractText>"}

Patients with combined segment disease were older, had twice the incidence of diabetes, and significantly more rest pain and gangrene on presentation. Aortic bifurcation grafts were placed in 114 patients. Relief of rest pain and threatened gangrene was uniformly good. However, relief of claudication was significantly poorer in patients with combined segment disease. There were 11 'late' thrombotic graft occlusions. Six grafts with distal anastamoses to the external iliacs failed because of limb outflow problems, while five grafts to the common femoral position exhibited more diffuse problems. Late graft failures were due to progression of disease and not problems intrinsic to the grafts. Cumulative patency rates were 98.0% at one year and 94.6% at three years.</AbstractText>"}

Three-fourths of the injuries were due to penetrating trauma with a 20% mortality and one-fourth due to blunt trauma resulting in an 18% mortality. The pancreatic injury was responsible for death in only 3% of patients. Early onset of shock resulted in 38% mortality whereas only 4% of normotensive patients died. No patient died of an isolated pancreatic injury. Sepsis was the second most common cause of death following hemorrhage. Preoperative serum amylase was elevated more frequently following blunt trauma than penetrating trauma, but did not correlate with injury. There has been a tendency toward more frequent use of distal pancreatectomy for simple penetrating injuries without obvious ductal violation which increases operative time, blood loss and possible intra-abdominal abscess since resection usually requires splenectomy. Patients considered for an 80% distal resection are better managed with a Roux-en-Y limb to the distal pancreas since three patients developed diabetes following an 80% or greater resection. A conservative approach consisting of Penrose and sump drainage is adequate for most injuries.</AbstractText>"}

Measurement of plasma immunoreactive arginine vasopressin, plasma osmolality, and urine osmolality after a period of dehydration separated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, cranial diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia, the three postulated mechanisms of lithium-induced polyuria. Seventeen patients had a urinary concentrating defect despite serum lithium concentrations in the therapeutic range. Ten of these patients had nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, one had results suggestive of cranial diabetes insipidus, but none had evidence of primary polydipsia. Symptoms of thirst and polyuria were poor indicators of the degree of hypo-osmolar urine. No patient had electrolyte abnormalities, and none had sufficiently severe polyuria to stop lithium treatment.</AbstractText>"}

The postglucose-load hyperglycemia segregated as an autosomal dominant trait; it was always mild, never requiring insulin, and generally seemed to start in the first two decades of life. Glucose, insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone were measured during glucose-tolerance tests in patients, relatives, and control subjects. Most hyperglycemic patients were found to have insulin deficiency. There was no correlation between the age of the patients and insulin secretion. Plasma glucagon and growth hormone were normal. Maturity-onset type of hyperglycemia in young people may be a frequent type of hyperglycemia, and its identification will generally depend on the presence of a strong family history. The recognition of maturity-onset type of hyperglycemia in young people as a specific disease different from juvenile, insulin-dependent diabetes is important, especially to prevent unnecessary use of insulin in hyperglycemic children.</AbstractText>"}

The anti-GBM and anticollagen antisera normally localize to GBM, while antiactomyosin localizes to the mesangium. Diabetic nephropathy revealed a striking expansion of mesangial material reacting with antiactomyosin. In contrast, the expanded mesangium in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis did not react with antiactomyosin, and the GBM localization of anti-GBM and anticollagen sera was similarly lost. The thickened GBM in diabetes mellitus and membranous nephropathy reacted with anti-GBM and anticollagen, but with accentuation of staining on the inner aspect of the GBM. In proliferative glomerulonephritis there was a moderate increase in the distribution of actomyosin. Glomerular sclerosis and hyalinization in all diseases studied was accompanied by a loss of immunofluorescent staining for all glomerular antigens, including collagen.</AbstractText>"}

Carnitine increased the rate of alpha-decarboxylation of leucine (125%) and valine (28%) by muscle, but it was without effect on the oxidation of these amino acids by liver. Carnitine increased the rate of alpha-decarboxylation of alpha-ketoisocaproate by both tissues. This effect was more pronounced in muscle (130% increase) than in liver (41% increase). The activity of carnitine acyltransferase, with isovaleryl-CoA as a substrate, was 18 times higher in muscle mitochondria than in liver mitochondria. Both starvation and diabetes increased the rate of alpha-decarboxylation of leucine by muscle without having a remarkable effect on the concentration of carnitine or the activity of carnitine acyltransferase. We conclude that: a) carnitine stimulates decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids by increasing the conversion of their ketoanalogues into carnitine esters, b) a greater carnitine acyltransferase activity in muscle than in liver may be responsible for the greater carnitine effect in muscle, c) carnitine does not appear responsible for the enhancement of leucine oxidation by muscle of starved and diabetic rats.</AbstractText>"}

Basal plasma values were 1.7 pg/ml in Wistar rat, and 2.4 pg/ml in dog. Pentobarbitone, used as anesthetic during collection of CSF from dog and rat, caused a significant rise of plasma AVP values in Wistar rats, but not in dogs. After withdrawal of CSF, the plasma AVP levels of Wistar rats were increased to 29.5 +/- 9.5 pg/ml, whereas the CSF levels from the same animals were 11.5 +/- 3.9 pg/ml. The response to the various stimuli was similar in Brattleboro rats, heterozygous for hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, and in Wistar rats. In Brattleboro rats, homozygous for hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, AVP was neither detectable in plasma nor in CSF. In dog and man, AVP levels in CSF samples were higher than in simultaneously obtained plasma samples. The possibility that AVP present in CSF, might be released directly from the synthetizing hypothalamic nuclei into the ventricular system is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Flow was measured using the 133Xe clearance technique preoperatively as well as at four and eight weeks after amputation. Amputation was performed using the standard long posterior flap technique, and patients were treated with either an immediate postoperative prosthetic fit or a controlled environment treatment system. Healing occurred primarily in 19 patients; a local below the knee revision was required in two and an above the knee revision in one patient. Flow was lower than in the nondiseased control group in almost all instances preoperatively, but no definite level below which healing would not occur was identified. Postoperatively, skin flow increased in all instances and had reached levels equal to that for the normal control group by eight weeks or sooner. This suggests that, in many instances of nonhealing, local below the knee revisions may be successful without requiring the higher above the knee procedure. No significant differences were noted between patients with diabetes and those without diabetes or either method of postoperative treatment in terms of healing or cutaneous flow.</AbstractText>"}

The insulin-dependent diabetic patient had a fourfold increase in the incidence of more severe (progressive) disease. Perioperative therapy with amphotericin B may be of value in the adult surgical candidate with progressive disease but is not necessary or desirable in the juvenile diabetic patient. Coccidioidomycosis is a disease of relative immunocompromise, and a negative skin test should herald such compromise and support a decision for surgery. Such surgery in the progressive stages should be totally extirpative. The presence of inadequately resected disease may adversely affect subsequent immunologic resistance of the host.</AbstractText>"}

Biopsies were obtained 6 to 15 months after administration of the drug. Although wide variations in the thickness of basement membranes were observed between capillaries in the same biopsy of each animal, no significant differences were found between the mean values of the experimental group when compared with those of 5 control animals. These results seem to support the 'genetic theory' of diabetic microangiopathies. It may prove of considerable interest to repeat these observations in more chronic stages of carbohydrate intolerance.</AbstractText>"}

The metabolism of [U-(14)C]glucose in perfused resting and contracting diaphragm muscle from normal rats and rats made diabetic with streptozotocin was studied in the presence and absence of insulin. 2. The incorporation of [U-(14)C]-glucose into glycogen and oligosaccharides was stimulated by insulin under all experimental conditions studied. 3. In the normal perfused resting diaphragm muscle the incorporation of radioactivity from [(14)C]glucose into lactate and CO(2) was not affected by insulin. 4. Periodic contractions, induced by electrical stimulation of the perfused diaphragm muscle in the absence of insulin, caused an increased incorporation of (14)C into glycogen and hexose phosphate esters, whereas incorporation of (14)C into lactate was greatly decreased. Production of (14)CO(2) in the contracting muscle was not significantly different from that in resting muscle. Addition of insulin to the perfusion liquid caused a further increase in formation of [(14)C]-glycogen in contracting muscle to values reached in the resting muscle in the presence of insulin. Formation of [(14)C]lactate was also stimulated by insulin, to values close to those found in the resting muscle in the presence of insulin. 5. In the diabetic resting muscle the rate of glucose metabolism was very low in the absence of insulin. Insulin increased formation of [(14)C]glycogen to the value found in normal muscle in the absence of insulin. Production of (14)CO(2) and formation of [(14)C]hexose phosphate remained unchanged. 6. In the diabetic contracting muscle production of (14)CO(2) was increased to values approaching those found in normal contracting muscle. Formation of [(14)C]lactate and [(14)C]glycogen was also increased by contraction, to normal values. Only traces of [(14)C]hexose phosphate were detectable. Addition of insulin to the perfusion medium stimulated formation of [(14)C]glycogen, to values found in normal contracting muscle. Production of [(14)C]hexose phosphate was stimulated by insulin, to approximately the values found in the normal contracting muscle. Production of (14)CO(2) and [(14)C]lactate, however, was not significantly affected by insulin. 7. These results indicate that the defects of glucose metabolism observed in perfused resting diabetic diaphragm muscle can be partially corrected by contraction, and in the presence of insulin the contracting diabetic muscle has a completely normal pattern of glycogen synthesis and lactate production, but CO(2) production remains impaired.</AbstractText>"}

Chlorpropamide had a sufficiently prolonged stimulatory effect on the beta cells such that normal basal plasma glucose levels were obtained in 13 patients. Both basal plasma C-peptide levels and the C-peptide response to meals became normal, with improved postprandial glycemia. Diurnal plasma triglyceride levels were reduced. Plasma growth hormone levels were normal both before and after therapy. When diet alone is insufficient to maintain basal normoglycemia in mild diabetes, chlorporpamide is as effective as basal insulin supplements in producing normal basal plasma glucose levels.</AbstractText>"}

The regulation of ketogenesis by intrahepatic enzymic processes and the roles of insulin deficiency or glucagon or other counterregulatory hormone excess are summarized. Major emphasis is placed on an analysis of the use of low-dose insulin regimens for the treatment of ketoacidosis. Most patients with diabetic ketoacidosis will respond to low-dose, hourly, intravenous or intramuscular regular insulin. Low doses of insulin are as effective as high doses and have fewer associated complications of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Phosphorus deficiency is common in diabetic ketoacidosis and hypophosphatemia usually becomes manifest within 4 to 12 h of institution of therapy. Phosphorus supplementation is now generally recommended to replete erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Coexistent and biochemically significant lactic acidosis is a relatively infrequent complication of diabetic ketoacidosis and when present is usually due to underlying disorders associated with poor tissue perfusion.</AbstractText>"}

Adipose tissue fragments were obtained from the abdominal wall by surgical biopsy under intracutaneous anesthesia. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion and incubated in buffer containing [1-14C] glucose and different concentrations of insulin. The metabolic effect of insulin was expressed as percent increase above control 14CO2 production. Maximal CO2 raised to 207 +/- 25% and 154 +/- 9% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. These values were significantly higher than in obese subjects displaying a pathological carbohydrate tolerance (group 3; 119 +/- 6%). A negative correlation was found between blood glucose levels and biological activity of insulin on adipocytes. The results suggest that insulin sensitivity of target tissue seems to play an important role in development of carbohydrate intolerance.</AbstractText>"}

Mean insulin response to oral (100 g) and i.v. glucose load (200 mg/kg followed by 20 mg/kg/min for 60 min) and to arginine infusion (25 g in 30 min) was normal in the prediabetics and delayed and higher in the subjects with chemical diabetes as compared to the control group. Glucagon response to arginine was higher, but not significantly, in prediabetics and in subjects with chemical diabetes. In both of these groups glucagon suppression by glucose was not observed. The insulin/glucagon molar ratio was significantly reduced after glucose infusion in these two groups. No correlation was found between insulin and glucagon secretion after arginine or glucose. A possible alteration in the mechanism controlling glucagon secretion even in the earliest phases of diabetes is suggested.</AbstractText>"}

The blunted insulin secretion was associated with markedly impaired glucose tolerance. A single injection of the islet activating protein (IAP), a protein derived from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis, into the spontaneous diabetic rats normalised glucose tolerance. The increase in insulin response to glucose was an important contributing factor to the improvement of glucose tolerance. This curative effect of the IAP on the diabetic state was of long duration; glucose tolerance remained virtually normal over a period of one month in the diabetic rats. Perfusion of the isolated pancreas of the diabetic rats pretreated with IAP showed an increase in insulin response to glucose and loss of suppression of glucagon secretion by noradrenaline.</AbstractText>"}

This was compared with the exocrine pancreatic response to an IV infusion of secretin and cholecystokinin-pancreozymin. Outputs of pancreatic bicarbonate, amylase and trypsin were measured. Exocrine secretory pancreatic function was decreased in 14 patients. Fasting and maximal CPR showed that 9 patients had residual insulin secretion. For these 'CPR-secretors' there was a strong correlation between CPR and output of bicarbonate (r = 0.87, p less than 0.005) and amylase (r = 0.7, p less than 0.05), but not with trypsin. These results suggest the existence of an endocrine-exocrine relationship in the pancreas.</AbstractText>"}

The extent of the heterogeneity within the juvenile-onset and maturity-onset types is still in question. On the basis of recent immunologic and metabolic studies we believe that further heterogeneity can be demonstrated within the juvenile-onset diabetic group. We wish to hypothesize that there are at least two distinct forms of juvenile-onset diabetes, one associated with HLA B8 and the other with BW15. The B8 type is characterized by autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and a stronger association with the HLA D locus. The BW15 type is characterized by antibody response to exogenous insulin and a stronger association with the HLA C locus. Greater understanding of the pathogenesis, natural history, and genetics of diabetes mellitus will result as the full extent of genetic heterogeneity is elucidated.</AbstractText>"}

The pathogenesis is discussed and a planned approach to the management of circulatory collapse, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity over the initial 24 hours is proposed. The phenomenon of insulin resistance which was observed in this case is a rare complication of this syndrome. Awareness of the occurrence of this syndrome in all age groups, early recognition of its features and a planned approach to management are mandatory to reduce the very high mortality rate.</AbstractText>"}

When 75% of the dietary carbohydrate was derived from food containing polysaccharides, the mean plasma insulin response to oral glucose was decreased relative to that seen following complementary diets providing carbohydrate mainly as simple sugars. Under both dietary conditions, glucose tolerance was improved compared to that seen prior to the study. These results suggest that with sugar restriction an improvement in the efficiency of the pancreatic beta-cell mechanism occurs. This effect may have been mediated by changes in the rate of secretion of pancreatic glucagon, or by an enteric secretogogue of insulin.</AbstractText>"}

Its effect on serial glucose tolerance was evaluated in ten patients with hypertriglyceridemia without overt diabetes. Six-hour oral glucose tolerance tests were done during a control period and every 24 weeks over two years of halofenate treatment. Abnormal glucose tolerance (chemical diabetes) was observed during the control period in six of ten patients. The number of abnormal tests gradually decreased to none by 48 weeks. Plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid values during the glucose tolerance tests were reduced significantly. Halofenate induced significant serum uric acid reduction. No significant regressions were observed among levels of lipids, hormones, glucose, and uric acid. The mechanisms by which lipid-lowering drugs improve glucose tolerance are as yet unexplained.</AbstractText>"}

Degradation by serum of 125I-Tyr1 SRIF in the assay, as assessed by chromatoelectrophoresis and immunoprecipitation, was overcome by using EDTA in the assay buffer and Trasylol in the blood samples. Serum samples thus obtained from 48 normal subjects revealed a bimodal distribution of SRIF-LI; 92 per cent (group 1) had a mean level of 0.274 +/- 0.009 ng. per milliliter. What was measured in these sera showed identity to synthetic SRIF on serial dilutions, Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and thin-layer chromatography, and it was shown to be immunoreactive by an antibody-Sepharose affinity system. Higher levels (1.0 +/- 0.041 ng. per milliliter) were found in 8 per cent of the sera; 50 per cent of this material behaved identically as serum SRIF-LI from group 1. The remainder proved to be heterogeneous, consisting of two peaks of large molecular weight, both of which shared immunologic identity with synthetic SRIF as shown by binding to the antibody-Sepharose affinity system. Their further nature is unknown.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":276854,"Title":"General characteristics of protein degradation in diabetes and starvation.","Journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Date":"May 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The enhanced protein degradation associated with diabetes and starvation is fundamentally different from normal protein catabolism. In normal eukaryotic cells large molecular weight proteins tend to be degraded more rapidly than small proteins, acidic proteins tend to be degraded more rapidly than neutral or basic proteins, and glycoproteins tend to be degraded more rapidly than nonglycoproteins. All three of these general correlations are absent or markedly reduced in liver and muscle of diabetic and starved rats. In contrast, the correlations between proteins size and half-life, between protein net charge and half-life, and between protein carbohydrate content and half-life are not affected in brain of diabetic or starved animals. These results suggest that diabetes and starvation alter the general characteristics of intracellular protein degradation in target tissues of insulin. Degradation of serum proteins is also affected in diabetes and starvation. In normal animals a general correlation exists between isoelectric points of serum proteins and their degradative rates. This relationship is abolished in diabetes and starvation, as it is among liver and muscle proteins. The implications of our findings are discussed with regard to possible mechanisms of the enhanced protein breakdown.</AbstractText>"}

A rapid, simple, and accurate competitive binding assay for plasma cAMP, which does not require chromatographic preparation of the sample, has been developed. This procedure prevents destruction of plasma cAMP by utilizing both theophylline and EDTA in the collection of the blood sample. Human plasma contains variable amounts of cAMP-binding activity which interfere with the measurement of cAMP by the standard competitive binding assay. Our assay procedure removes this binding activity by precipitation of plasma proteins with perchloric acid. The normal fasting value (+/- SD) of plasma cAMP using this technique is 17.6 +/- 4.3 pmol/ml, which is identical to values obtained by methods utilizing chromatographic purification of samples (18.3 +/- 3.0). The fasting plasma cAMP of patients with hyperparathyroidism is normal (16.2 +/- 3.4), but patients with maturity-onset diabetes mellitus have fasting values significantly below normal (12.3 +/- 2.4).</AbstractText>"}

Patients with gastrointestinal and pancreatic disorders.","Journal":"Gut","Date":"Nov 1971","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Gastrointestinal disease other than hepatobiliary and pancreatic disorders was associated with hourly rates of urinary amylase excretion above the limits of normal for control subjects (88 IU/hour compared with 69 IU/hour). In hepatobiliary disease, excretion rates of more than 88 but usually less than 190 IU/hour were sometimes found. Whilst rates of urinary amylase excretion were not helpful in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or carcinoma of the pancreas, levels above 190 IU/hour were found in acute pancreatitis at a time when the serum levels were also diagnostic. After the acute episode the rate of urinary amylase excretion was moderately elevated for up to six days but did not reach diagnostic levels. Persistent elevation of serum amylase and lipase levels and hourly rates of urinary amylase excretion for more than six days suggested that a pseudocyst had developed. In acute pancreatitis the level of serum lipase was more frequently raised and persisted so for longer than either the serum or urinary amylase. Although the hourly rate of urinary amylase excretion is of little value alone, when performed in conjunction with evaluating the serum amylase and lipase it may provide useful additional evidence of pancreatic disease and it could be useful in the diagnosis of relapsing chronic pancreatitis.</AbstractText>"}

In 41 JOD patients (61%) CB4 antibodies (greater than 1:4) were found. A high prevalence (69%) of significant CB4 antibody titers (greater than 1:64) was observed in patients with age at onset between 11 and 20 years compared with those with age at onset below or over that age-range (27% and 33%, respectively). Islet-cell antibodies (ICA) could be detected only in 11 JOD patients, which is probably due to the relatively long mean duration of disease. However, 8 of them presented with significant CB4 antibody production. Although no correlation between CB4 antibodies and the JOD-associated HLA-antigens (B8, Bw15, Cw3 and B7) could be detected in the entire group of JOD patients, a close association between ICA persistence and HLA B8 was found. Furthermore, in the ICA-positive, moderate or high CB4 antibody titers were prevalent. Thus, the present data point to a possible interrelationship between CB4 virus antibodies, persistent ICA production and HLA B8 in a minor proportion of JOD patients. However, it seems premature to assume direct implication of these factors in the pathogenesis of JOD.</AbstractText>"}

On presentation, a history was taken for diabetes, height and weight, and the blood pressure was recorded. The blood samples were drawn in clot tubes and taken to a commercial laboratory for overnight refrigeration and testing of the serum. Testing included observation of serum for massive chylomicronemia, triglycerides, cholesterol and lipoprotein electrophoresis (by the cellulose acetate method). Lipoprotein testing results showed 12 patients with Type II A or II B and 8 patients with Type IV abnormalities. No Types I, III or V were found. These 20 patients represent a lower number of hyperlipoproteinemic patients than would be expected in the general population.</AbstractText>"}

When expressed on the basis of membrane protein content, 5'-nucleotidse activity, or specific [125I] insulin binding, the extend of [125I] glucagon binding by liver membranes was not influenced by aging. Furthermore, the degree of [125I] glucagon degradation was the same in both membrane preparations.

The insulin-secretory response to potassium chloride (KCl) infusion, however, is not suppressed; in fact, in ureter-ligated dogs simultaneously infused with 360 microgram. epinephrine per hour and 2 mEq. KCl per kilogram per hour, insulin release is actually increased about threefold (over controls). Propranolol blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors essentially abolishes the insulin response to KCl infusion, with and without epinephrine. It is unlikely that KCl, like epinephrine, provokes insulin release by direct stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors of the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. However, potassium in some way enhances the beta adrenergic (secretory) activity of epinephrine and blunts its usually dominant alpha-adrenergic (inhibitory) effect.</AbstractText>"}

Splenic lymphocytes from obese and normal C57B1/6 mice exhibited similar responses to the nonspecific T and B cell mitogens, Concanavalin A (Con A) and E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. A small (25%) depression of the blastogenic response in MLC was observed for lymphocytes from obese mice. The generation of cytotoxic T cells in vitro in response to trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNP)-modified syngeneic spleen cells was the same for normal and obese mice. In contrast, splenic lymphocytes from 7-14 day streptozotocin-diabetic mice had lower (56-60%) proliferative responses in MLC. The generation of cytotoxic effector cells in vitro was lower for spleen cells for spleen cells from 22-day streptozotocin mice, although blastogenic responses in MLC were not depressed. The insulin-deficient streptozotocin mice appear to have a depression of some thymus-derived cell functions that may be associated with streptozotocin rather than the diabetic state. Direct immunosuppressive effects of streptozotocin are indicated by the marked decrease in the number of lymphocytes in the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":77236,"Title":"Type I diabetes mellitus.","Journal":"Diabetologia","Date":"May 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The major genetic susceptibility to insulin dependent (Type 1) diabetes is determined by genes in the HLA chromosomal region. An increased relative risk for developing the disease is observed in subjects who are HLA A1, A2, B8, B18, B15, B40, CW3, Bfs, DW3, DW4, DRW3, DRW4 positive. There is an additive relative risk in subjects who possess two 'high risk' HLA B alleles which has an important influence on the prevalence of the disease in sibships and possibly on the concordance rate in diabetic identical twins. There is also suggestive evidence that particular combinations of 'high risk' HLA B alleles are associated with increased or persistent antibody production which may reflect enhanced or differential susceptibility. Certain factors (e.g. HLA B7, DW2 and DRW2) are associated with a significantly reduced risk and may exert a 'protective' mechanism in Type I diabetes, by linkage disequilibrium with genes which reduce immune responsiveness. The significant increases and decreases in respect of the HLA B antigens are probably secondary to the corresponding HLA D and DRW associations which reflect a stronger linkage disequilibrium between the genes which determine these specificities and the putative genes which control susceptibility. Initial damage to the beta cells probably occurs a considerable time before the onset of symptoms and theoretically modification of the immune response early in the disease process may reduce the rate of beta cell destruction.</AbstractText>"}

The tip of the left renal papilla was exposed and fluid was obtained by micropuncture from loops of Henle and from collecting ducts at the papillary tip, and at an average of 1 mm proximal to the tip. In water diuresis the ratio of tubule fluid to plasma (TF/P) osmolality (osm) of loop fluid was 1.73 +/-0.058 (SE); of fluid from the proximal collecting duct, 0.63 +/-0.027; and from the tip, 0.55 +/-0.024; indicating a substantial osmotic pressure difference across the collecting duct epithelium. The fraction of filtered water reabsorbed (x 100) by the terminal collecting duct was 1.58% +/-0.32. In antidiuresis the TF/P osm of loop fluid was 2.65 +/-0.109; of fluid from the proximal collecting duct, 2.20 +/-0.093; and from the tip, 2.71 +/-0.111; indicating a marked decrease in the driving force for water reabsorption. The fraction of filtered water reabsorbed (x 100) by the terminal collecting duct was reduced to 0.58% +/-0.08, while the delivery of solute to the same segment was unchanged from that in water diuresis. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the right kidney declined from 327 +/-24.4 mul/min in water diuresis to 274 +/-24.4 mul/min in antidiuresis (P &lt; 0.005); similar results were obtained in a study comparing right and left GFRs in five additional rats. Thus, fractional reabsorption (and very likely the absolute volume) of water reabsorbed by the terminal collecting duct was less in antidiuresis than in water diuresis (mean difference, 1.01% +/-0.29, P &lt; 0.005).</AbstractText>"}

The present paper reports on a two daily injection treatment with monocomponent Semilente insulin (SeLe MC) in comparison with an earlier management with conventional retard insulins, in a group of 16 insulin dependent diabetics, selected among the most poorly controlled patients with unstable diabetes and/or high insulin requirement. In 6 subjects, after transfer to SeLe MC, it was observed a reduction in M bs, delta, and M delta indices of the glycemic regulation, indicating lower mean glycemic profiles with fewer irregularities. In 11 cases a marked improvement in the subjective symptomatology was noticed. Some minor hypoglycemic reactions induced to a reduction in the high insulin requirement in 8 cases. All but two patients had significant values of insulin IgG antibodies. The period of observation was too short to take in consideration an immunological modification, as an explanation of the present clinical results. However, these could be hypothetically referred to an amelioration in the releasing of endogenous insulin and/or in the hormone-receptor interaction as a consequence of treatment with monocomponent insulin preparations, in comparison to non purified conventional preparations. Treatment with SeLe MC seems to be suitable in particularly difficult control of the diabetes and in emergency situations.</AbstractText>"}

A second experiment in which chlorpropamide (5 mg/24 h) was administered to DI rats treated with Pitressin (either 25 or 50 mu/24 h) confirmed the lack of any significant drug-effect on water metabolism in these animals.4 Chlorpropamide (20 mg/24 h), when administered alone or simultaneously with a submaximal dose of Pitressin (25 mu/24 h), had no obvious effect on the fluid intake of glucose-hydrated heterozygous rats. The absence of any action by chlorpropamide on water metabolism was confirmed in these experimental animals using 5 mg/24 h of the drug together with Pitressin (either 25 or 50 mu/24 hours).5 Indirect evidence for the slower growth-rate in the DI rat being due to an insufficient daily calorific intake was obtained from the study on glucose-hydrated heterozygous rats.</AbstractText>"}

The fascicular area of interganglionic segments of the paravertebral sympathetic chain showed less variation than that previously reported for controls. Fibre densities were higher in the patients than in controls of similar age and the percentage of small fibres in alcoholics and diabetics is larger than in controls. Only 17% of fibres were larger than 5 μm in diameter in the patients, whereas, in controls, 33% of fibres were larger than 5 μm in diameter. No correlation between internodal lengths and fibre diameter was found in the patients who showed uniformly short internodes averaging only about half of internodal distances found in control subjects. The uniformly short internodes are attributed to complete degeneration followed by partial regeneration and are compatible with either Wallerian degeneration or a `dying back' phenomenon. The short internodal lengths should be reflected in slowed conduction velocities in white rami communicantes and could account for abnormalities in baroreflex activity, sweating, and in visceral dysfunction commonly seen in patients with chronic alcoholism or diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

A mail survey of our clinic population and a study done at the Quebec camp for diabetic children in 1969 revealed that certain lot numbers were associated with poor control and that a change to new lot numbers or alternate insulin preparations resulted in better control. 'Suspect' insulin preparations and non-suspect insulins were given to newly diagnosed diabetics, and plasma insulin and glucose levels were measured over a 24-hour period. The data confirmed that the 'suspect' insulins were causing early hypoglycemia and failing to control hyperglycemia during the latter hours of the 24-hour period. The lower glucose levels were associated with higher plasma insulin levels. The 'suspect' insulins were further found to have elevated levels of free insulin in the supernatant fluid.The requirements for quality control of modified insulin preparations are reviewed and suggestions are offered for their improvement.</AbstractText>"}

Although an increase in the mean GTT after birth is to be expected--and was observed in the control group--, under diet the GTT values actually decreased post partum. 3.

Individuals with diabetes mellitus have elevated levels of Hb A1c, a hemoglobin modified with a glucose moiety at the NH2 terminus of each beta chain. A new chromatographic technique using Bio-Rex 70 is described which not only allows complete separation of Hb A1a from Hb A1b but also resolution of Hb A1a into two components, designated Hb A1a1 and Hb A1a2. Carbohydrate determinations with the thiobarbituric acid procedure revealed that Hb A1a1, Hb A1a2, and Hb A1b as well as Hb A1c were glycosylated. Total phosphate analysis revealed 2.06 and 1.01 mol of phosphorus/alphabeta dimer for Hb A1a1 and Hb A1a2 respectively; Hb A1b and Hb A1c contained no detectable phosphate. Hemoglobin incubated with D-[14C]glucose-6-P co-chromatographs precisely with Hb A1a2, strongly suggesting that Hb A1a2 is glucose-6-P hemoglobin. Levels of Hb A1a1 and Hb A1a2 are normal in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, diabetic red cells contain normal levels of glucose-6-P. Therefore, glucose-6-P hemoglobin does not serve as a significant precursor to Hb A1c. Instead Hb A1c is formed by the direct reaction of hemoglobin with glucose. This suggests that hemoglobin can serve as a model system for nonenzymatic glycosylation of protein.</AbstractText>"}

The other 67 produced profiles on 241 dyas. Even patients with a limited education could use the technique accurately and their readings correlated closely with simultaneous laboratory values (r = 0.96). Self-monitoring was especially useful in elucidating problems in diabetic control, preventing hypoglycaemia, and managing diabetic pregnancy. Unlike the measurement of HbA1c which only detects poor diabetic control, self-monitoring also shows how to improve it. Patients found self-monitoring more informative than urine tests; their active involvement in management of their disease resulted in better motivation, greater understanding of diabetes, and a sustained improvement in control. By the end of the study 32 of the 67 patients ahd profiles in which no more than one blood-glucose value exceeded 10 mmol/l.

The records made at home by 53 of these patients have shown that this led to a significant improvement in blood-glucose control. A majority (64%) were able to maintain 'good' control (80% of blood-glucose recordings equal to or less than 10 mmol/l for periods as long as 478 days). This hitherto unobtainable degree of control of blood-glucose was achieved mostly with conventional insulin regimens of twice-daily 'Actrapid' (Novo Laboratories Ltd.) and 'Leo-Retard' (Leo Laboratories Ltd.). Adjustments of insulin dosage and type were found to be much easier and more predictable than with urine-glucose analysis. No significant complications were encountered. Hypoglycaemic episodes were less frequent. 70% of patients preferred blood-tests to urine tests and 92% would like to buy their own meter 'if the price was right.' The results suggest that self-monitoring of blood-glucose by diabetics makes possible, for the first time, the achievement of near normoglycaemia. This may reduce the incidence of long-term diabetic complications.</AbstractText>"}

There is a two- to threefold increase in hemoglobin AIc in the red cells of patients with diabetes mellitus. By providing an integrated measurement of blood glucose, hemoglobin AIc is useful in assessing the degree of diabetic control. Furthermore, this hemoglobin is a useful model of nonenzymatic glycosylation of other proteins that may be involved in the long-term complications of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Hypercortisolism was corrected in 17 patients (i.e., in 16 of the 17 undergoing selective tumor removal and in the one with total hypophysectomy). Panhypopituitarism occurred only in this patient, and transient diabetes insipidus occurred in five. Most patients became glucocorticoid deficient and required replacement therapy.

Hypothyroid animals excreted a significantly smaller fraction of a 50-ml/kg oral water load than controls, demonstrating the same limited ability to excrete free water as thyroid-deficient man. During hypotonic (0.45%) saline infusion, absolute sodium delivery to the diluting segment and free water clearance were markedly lower in hypothyroid rats. However, both fractional distal sodium delivery and fractional free water clearance were similar in hypothyroid and control animals, suggesting that the reduced absolute free water formation in hypothyroid rats was due to decreased net distal delivery. In support of this hypothesis was the observation that fractional distal sodium reabsorption was equal or higher in thyroid-deficient rats, which indicates that the sodium reabsorptive capacity of the diluting segment was preserved in these animals. The results cannot be attributed to incomplete suppression of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) since they were identical in diabetes insipidus rats, nor to different rates of non-ADH-dependent backflux of filtrate since tissue osmolality and solute concentrations in the cortex, medulla, and papilla were similar in hypothyroid and control rats of both Sprague-Dawley and Brattleboro strains. The functional integrity of the diluting segment in hypothyroid rats was further demonstrated in experiments in which distal delivery was increased by contralateral nephrectomy or by administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors which decrease proximal sodium reabsorption. In both studies, fractional free water clearance increased markedly reaching levels significantly greater than in euthyroid controls. These results demonstrate that the impaired ability of the hypothyroid rat to excrete a water load is not due to incomplete suppression of ADH or decreased reabsorptive capacity of the diluting segment but results from decreased filtrate delivery to this site secondary to reduced GFR.</AbstractText>"}

Electron microscopic studies showed the nodules to be deposits of fine-grained material that corresponded to precipitations of protein but lacked the basement-membrane-like material characteristic of nodular glomerulosclerosis in diabetics. What is more, a unique collagen was observed in the marginal area of the nodules and in the periglomerular interstitium. The possible causes of the origin and distribution of this collagen not so far described in the human kidney are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Because peptidases play a significant role in peptide digestion, we examined the effect of diabetes on intestinal peptidases. Leucyl-naphthylamidase and leucyl-glycine hydrolase (brush border peptidases) and prolyl-glycine hydrolase (cytosol peptidase) were assayed in the brush border and cytosol fraction in diabetic rats 7 days after alloxan administration. Mucosal weight, protein concentration, and total and specific activity of leucyl-naphthylamidase and leucyl-glycine hydrolase were significantly increased in diabetes in the brush border but not in cytosol fraction. By contrast, prolyl-glycine hydrolasw was not affected in cytosol fraction or brush border. These data indicate that brush border peptidases are increased in experimental diabetes. This adaptive response of the small intestinal mucosa is similar to disaccharidase elevation and alteration in the intestinal absorptive function which occurs in experimental diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

On the basis of modern literature and personal experience with glucocorticosteroid therapy in 1210 patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive bronchitis during the years 1972 to 1977 (34.9% of all patients in this group of diagnoses) are given some recommendations for practical handling of glucocorticosteroid therapy in obstructive airways diseases.</AbstractText>"}

A retrospective assessment of data relating to in-patients of the Umberto I Hospital Medical Division during 1972-1975 showed that atherosclerosis occurs more often and earlier in diabetics. It is more frequent in women over 50, especially in the case of coronary forms. A similar high incidence of vascular lesions is also noted in subclinical forms. This is particularly true of coronary sites in females and lower extremity sites in males. It is clear that screening for glucose intolerance in all vasculopathic subjects, coupled with careful genetic and familial investigation, are essential acids to preventive and social medicine in this particular sector.</AbstractText>"}

The ratio of AMI to ACI was higher among diabetic than among nondiabetic patients, especially among women. In comparison with the nondiabetic AMI patients, the diabetics, especially women, had a significantly longer interval between onset of symptoms and hospitalization and more often had painless infarcts, both of which resulted in delay of adequate treatment; the diabetics with AMI han more complications and a significantly higher case fatality rate (20.8vs. 14.3% for nondiabetics; in diabetic women the rate was 24.1%). in fatal cases of AMI the mean age at death was lower among diabetics than among nondiabetics. In fatal cases among diabetics death was more often associated with an anteroseptal AMI site, and was the result of one or more of the following: left heart failure (61.6%), shock (38.3%), sudden death from ventricular fibrillation (13.3%), atrioventricular block (8.3%), or systemic or pulmonary arterial thromboembolism (6.5%); it was very rarely the result of diabetic ketosis.</AbstractText>"}

The proportion of patients with diabetes was 30.2% (30.7% in AMI, and 27.7% in ACI; age-corrected rates at greater than or equal to 40 years). This was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the corresponding rate of diabetes (20.2%) in the general population of Malta. There was a significantly greater prevalence of diabetes among women than among men with AIHD: the proportion with diabetes was 50.0% among women with AMI and 41.3 among women with ACI. The diabetes was mostly of the maturity-onset type. The high frequency of AIHD among diabetics seemed to be chiefly attributable to the effects of the diabetic state, either directly or indirectly through its association with other risk factors: obesity, physical inactivity, excessive eating and high plasma cholesterol levels. Diastolic hypertension and chronic bronchitis and emphysema associated withe heavy smoking were no more common in diabetics than in nondiabetics with AMI.</AbstractText>"}

The double cortisone and glucose load did not influence the glucose tolerance in the patients. In persons investigated during AP and one year later only slight improvement of insulin response was noted. The results support the significance of follow-up studies of carbohydrate tolerance and insulin response in patients after AP for the evaluation of the diabetic risk in such cases.</AbstractText>"}

Peculiarities of intracellular distribution of the enzyme in the Nucl. dorsalis n. vagi (ND) and Nucl. ambiguus n. vagi (NA) of intact animals were demonstrated. Changes in the ratio of cholinergic neurons with moderate and strongly-positive AChE staining reactions were revealed in the ND of alloxan-diabetic rats. The dynamics of the changes attested to increased AChE activity of these neurons in response to insulin deficiency. The data obtained are additional evidence for the responsiveness of ND neurons to insulin deficiency, which was demonstrated earlier in alloxan-diabetic rats by karyometry (Akmayev and Rabkina, 1976 b). It is suggested that changes in the plasma glucose or insulin levels may be the stimulus that influences the activity of the ND cholinergic neurons. By means of this mechanism the central vagal nucleus at the medulla oblongata level may be implicated in the feedback control of insulin secretion.</AbstractText>"}

There is a significant correlation between zinc and insulin (p less than 0.001), and between the quotient zinc/copper and cholesterol (p less than 0.001). The increase of plasma zinc can reflect a deficient storage or a chronic hypersecretion of insulin in hyperglucemic patients.

The plasma triglyceride levels, determined after overnight fasting, were elevated following administration of oral agents or injections of insulin.

The levels of plasma triglyceride were reduced when doses of oral antidiabetic agents or insulin were kept constant for several days, and further reduction was observed after withdrawal of these therapeutics.

The mean insulin level in metabolically normal pregnancies rose from 9 muU/ml (Week 27) to 15 muU/ml (Week 40). The insulin level in amniotic fluid of diabetic patients was elevated up to 27 times the mean. Insulin levels in the umbilical cord and urine of newborns of diabetic mothers were also elevated, to 29 and 21 times the mean, respectively. Elevation of insulin levels in amniotic fluid portends diabetogenic fetal morbidity. High and rising insulin levels at an early stage (26-28 weeks) may indicate a high risk of preterm onset of labor. Regular adjustment of metabolic compensation on the basis of amniotic fluid insulin made it possible to reduce the level in 12 of 17 pregnant diabetic women by increasing insulin dosage. The 12 women were thereby enabled to carry their pregnancies to term and to await the onset of spontaneous labor without diabetogenic fetal morbidity. Beta-stimulating agents affect glucose management and may cause elevated insulin levels in amniotic fluid.</AbstractText>"}

The disease's rate of progress has been studied anatomically, clinically, radiologically, and plethysmographically. We conclude that arteriosclerosis is usually associated with other diseases such as diabetes, high blood cholesterol, and hypertension. Heart disease in particular is often the cause of the patient's death, rather than the peripheral arteriosclerotic disease itself. The usually slow development and course of arteriosclerosis indicate that its treatment is largely a medical problem. It seems important to control the various risk factors and to utilize surgical therapy to attack specific lesions which threaten the tissues. A thorough cardiovascular profile of the patient should be compiled and should include a glucose tolerance test and lipoprotein phenotyping.</AbstractText>"}

Long-lasting haemorrhagic hypotension (4.5 hr at 35 mmHg) leading to irreversible haemorrhagic shock, has been studied in normal dogs, in dogs treated with a bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide (BPP(9a)), which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and in dogs with experimental chronic diabetes insipidus (DI dogs). BPP(9a) was given by I.V. injection before the start of bleeding (BPP pre-treated group), 45 min after blood pressure had reached 35 mmHg (BPP early treated group) or 2 hr after blood pressure had reached 35 mmHg (BPP late-treated group). After retransfusion of blood all dogs were allowed to recover and observed for a further period of 3 days.2. Untreated control dogs developed haemorrhagic shock with tachycardia, low cardiac output, low total peripheral conductance and low stroke volume. All died within 24 hr of retransfusion, with pathological lesions typical of irreversible haemorrhagic shock.3. BPP pre-treated dogs developed haemorrhagic shock with bradycardia (during early shock), high cardiac output, high peripheral vascular conductance and high stroke volume when compared with the untreated controls. All pre-treated animals survived the 3 day observation period. They were then killed and on post-mortem showed no signs of irreversible haemorrhagic shock.4. BPP early-treated animals behaved like controls before BPP, but like pre-treated animals after the drug. Only one out of eight died within the 3 day observation period.5. BPP late-treated dogs behaved like controls before BPP. They responded to the drug with a rise in cardiac output, peripheral vascular conductance and stroke volume, and with a fall in heart rate. These responses were, however, short-lived. Four out of these eight animals died within the 3 day observation period, with lesions of irreversible haemorrhagic shock.6. DI dogs developed haemorrhagic shock with tachycardia (like controls), but with high cardiac output and peripheral vascular conductance (like BPP pre-treated dogs). The stroke volume of DI dogs was intermediate between those of controls and pre-treated groups. All six dogs survived the 3 day observation period.7. BPP(9a) had no measurable effect on the course of endotoxic shock.8. It is suggested that the normally severe vasoconstriction of the mesenteric vascular bed, which is thought to be responsible for irreversible haemorrhagic shock, is absent or attenuated in the absence of vasopressin or angiotensin. The consequences of this on the development of irreversibility are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Sodium acetoacetate was infused into the inferior vena cava of fed rats, 48h-starved rats, and fed streptozotocin-diabetic rats treated with insulin. Arterial blood was obtained from a femoral artery catheter. 2. Acetoacetate infusion caused a fall in blood glucose concentration in fed rats from 6.16 to 5.11mm in 1h, whereas no change occurred in starved or fed-diabetic rats. 3. Plasma free fatty acids decreased within 10min, from 0.82 to 0.64mequiv./l in fed rats, 1.16 to 0.79mequiv./l in starved rats and 0.83 to 0.65mequiv./l in fed-diabetic rats. 4. At 10min the plasma concentration rose from 20 to 49.9muunits/ml in fed unanaesthetized rats and from 6.4 to 18.5muunits/ml in starved rats. There was no change in insulin concentration in the diabetic rats. 5. Nembutal-anaesthetized fed rats had a more marked increase in plasma insulin concentration, from 30 to 101muunits/ml within 10min. 6. A fall in blood glucose concentration in fed rats and a decrease in free fatty acids in both fed and starved rats is to be expected as a consequence of the increase in plasma insulin. 7. The fall in the concentration of free fatty acids in diabetic rats may be due to a direct effect of ketone bodies on adipose tissue. A similar effect on free fatty acids could also be operative in normal fed or starved rats.</AbstractText>"}

The enrollees received comprehensive health services at zero out-of-pocket cost from either a prepaid group practice plan or an independent practice plan. Surveys were periodically conducted to determine health status, satisfaction, and demographic characteristics of the enrollees; utilization of services was monitored throughout the experiment. The causal model is operationalized through the use of path analysis. Significant relationships (p less than or equal to .10) were established between satisfaction and perceived access to care, family size, sex, and professional qualifications of the provider; between outcome of care and health status, female education, and physician performance; between physician performance and professional qualifications; between continuity of care and health status and female education; between utilization and perceived access, specialty of provider, and provider system; and between access to care and provider system.

The local retinal circulation time RCT of selected retinal areas was calculated by means of a fluorescein long-term infusion technique. In 7 eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR) the mean RCT was significantly higher (2.0 +/- 0.58 sec. range 1.27-2.6) than in 15 control eyes (1.11 +/- 0.34 sec, range 0.50-1.82, Niesel 1976). Assuming an increase of blood flow in DR (L'Esperance 1971, Kohner 1975) the increase of RCT by a factor 2 would imply an increase of the vascular volume by a factor hardly less than 3 indicating the marked impairment of retinal hemodynamics in DR. After photocoagulation, the mean RCT was significantly shortened only in eyes with preoperative RCT values above 2 sec. The reduction of local RCT correlated with the extent of treated retinal areas. The cross-sectional area of the retinal veins measured near the optic disc was generally reduced independently of the extent of coagulation treatment. Taking also the obvious postoperative reduction of the total retinal vascular volume into account, photocoagulation resulted in a marked decrease of blood flow not only in extensively treated but also in areas with little coagulation effects. In DR the disturbed retinal circulation in general tends to normalize following extensive photocoagulation.</AbstractText>"}

Diagnosis is based on the clinical findings of pancreatic inflammation, laboratory confirmation with elevated serum and/or urinary amylase values, and in some cases surgical or postmortem tissue substantiation. Four major classes of pancreatitis are defined in children: (1) traumatic; (2) systemic-disease associated; (3) drug-induced, caused by drug therapy for various life-threatening diseases, and (4) chronic pancreatitis, with or without an anatomic abnormality. If cases of traumatic pancreatitis are excluded, females outnumber males 5 to 1. A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis, and this is very important if the mortality for pancreatitis in children is to be lowered. Awareness and consistent early aggressive intervention should increase the salvage rate.</AbstractText>"}

In a second series of experiments, tibial motor nerve conduction velocity in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes was compared with conduction velocity in diabetic animals given 1% supplementary dietary myoinositol, and with a control group of nondiabetic rats. Conduction velocity was reduced in the diabetic animals, but no influence from the added dietary myoinositol was detected.

The correlation between single values deriving from the time-activity curves and their clinical predictive value was ascertained. A strong correlation between the parameters and the clinical findings resulted when several criteria were considered simultaneously. Among the single values resulting from the perfusion curves, the Tmax (placenta) and Tmax (uterus) (time of activity maximum) as well as the quotient of both revealed the highest significance.

Claudication was the presenting complaint in all but one patient, with one-third having ischemic rest pain. The average age of these patients was 54 years, and their histories revealed a surprising absence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or diabetes, although 40% had essential hypertension. Heavy tobacco use, however, was characteristic of the entire group. Arteriography proved valuable in identifying and characterizing the vascular abnormalities, but posed problems in technique and interpretation. Significant distal arterial disease was detected radiographically in only 21% of these patients. Operative correction of the aortic occlusion was performed on 26 patients, 18 by aortic bypass grafts and eight by aorto-iliac endarterectomy, with one early postoperative death. Although the thrombus extended to the renal artery origins in 77% of the cases, a well-designed technical approach did not require renal artery occlusion. Using serial creatinine determinations, one case of renal insufficiency was detected which was associated with prolonged postoperative hypotension. Although the extent of distal disease was more severe in those who underwent bypass, symptoms of claudication returned earlier and were more prominent in the endarterectomy group. This recurrence of systems was not favorably altered by sympathectomy performed concomitantly with the initial procedure. Even though this condition seems to pose difficult technical obstacles and has a poor prognosis, infrarenal aortic occlusion can be successfully treated by aortic bypass, with favorable long-term results, if particular attention is paid to elements of the preoperative evaluation and the intraoperative technical requirements peculiar to this relatively uncommon disease entity.</AbstractText>"}

The comparison group comrised patients undergoing traditional treatment (n = 28). Nine (75%) persistent (over 3-14 months of duration) although partial (oral drugs required) remissions were obtained in the former group as compared to 3 (11%) in the latter group (p less than 0.05). Cases which showed remissions after insulin infusion had a plasma insulin response to IV glucagon still present before insulin infusion, and a daily urinary C-peptide excretion significantly enhanced after (p less than 0.01). Urinary C-peptide/blood glucose remained improved during the remission period. Thus, early effective treatment by means of the artificial pancreas may break the vicious circle hyperglycaemia-insulin depletion-hyperglycaemia and lead to frequent and sustained remissions of juvenile diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The flotation with phospholipid resulted in the extraction of additional protein, in a corresponding increase in specific activity, and in relipidation of the particles to their original phospholipid content. Detergents alone did not extract any additional protein. Relipidation caused a change in the properties of the microsomal membrane, as indicated by a 4-fold decrease in the K(m) for glucose 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate. The maximal rate was not affected. The crude homogenate of diabetic rat liver contained more latent enzyme than that of normal rats. The diabetic rats also yielded purified microsomal particles of specific glucose 6-phosphatase activity twice that of normal and five times that of phenobarbital-treated rats, indicating that some regulatory mechanism exists for the incorporation of different amounts of the enzyme into the endoplasmic reticulum.</AbstractText>"}

U-14C alanine and U-14C glucose infusions were given to healthy subjects and to subjects with untreated mild maturity, severe maturity, and juvenile diabetes. Comparative studies after a 24-hour fast were made in healthy and in mildly diabetic subjects. The alanine production rate was unaltered by fasting or diabetes. The glucose production rate was unaltered by fasting but increased in diabetes in relation to the severity of the disease. The fractions of alanine-to-glucose and of glucose-from-alanine were increased by fasting. The effect of diabetes was different. The fraction of alanine-to-glucose was much less in mild maturity diabetes than in health, and it was increased only in juvenile diabetes. In all the diabetic groups the glucose-from-alanine fraction was much less than in health. In every group the change in the alanine oxidation rate was reciprocal to that in the alanine-derived glucogenesis rate. The results are consistent with the possibility that the principal source of the excess circulating glucose in diabetes is glycogen.</AbstractText>"}

L-dopa either without or after a concomitant oral administration of 100 gm. glucose on the plasma level of pancreatic glucagon, plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI), and plasma growth hormone (GH) was assessed in eight normal and 10 insulin-treated diabetic subjects. In the normal group the stimulatory effect o L-dopa on pancreatic glucagon release was reconfirmed. Moreover, in the diabetics essentially the same plasma glucagon increase after drug administration was found, such a response being inhibited in both groups by glucose. The increase of plasma GH after L-dopa in both healthy persons and diabetics and the inhibition of this response by glucose in healthy subjects was reconfirmed. Furthermore, the same effect of exogenous glucose on the L-dopa induced GH release was observed in diabetics. It may be concluded that glucagon may play a pathogenetic role in the worsening of parkinsonian diabetic patients during the treatment with L-dopa and that diabetic hyperglycemia per se seems to be insufficient for an inhibition of the release of both glucagon and GH AFTer L-dopa.</AbstractText>"}

Twice-chromatographed HbAIc alone and in admixtures with normal and diabetic hemolysates were employed to verify the identification and quantification of the AIc component. Relative concentration was determined as a per cent of the total hemoglobin absorption at 556 nm on acid-fixed, unstained gels. A total of 60 patient samples were examined by IEF, and, for 35 samples, both column chromatography and IEF determination were obtained, revealing excellent correlation between these two methods.</AbstractText>"}

The effects of streptozotocin-diabetes on the local and general responses to a 4 h period of bilateral hind-limb ischaemia in the rat have been investigated. The rats were injured 48 h after the intravenous injection of the streptozotocin. 2. Less fluid was lost from the circulation into the injured limbs after injury in the diabetic rats and this was directly related to the severity of the diabetes, but could not be explained by dehydration. However, when the diabetic and nondiabetic injured rats were considered together there was significant negative correlation between either plasma osmolality or plasma glucose concentration and water content in the injured hind limb. 3. The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and plasma osmolality was changed by injury such that, particularly in the injured diabetic rats, plasma osmolality at a given glucose concentration was higher than that predicted from the relationship betweeen these variables in the uninjured rat.</AbstractText>"}

Survival until Dec 31, 1973, was found to be adversely affected by the presence of coma or unconsciousness and the absence of localizing signs and symptoms. Also, the prognosis was poor if the heart was enlarged on the x-ray film or the ECG was abnormal. On the other hand, the presence of individual clinical entities such as hypertension, hypertensive heart disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or diabetes did not affect the survival significantly. These findings will help in predicting the prognosis and in planning for management of stroke cases.</AbstractText>"}

Each diet was maintained for 10 days and was the same in calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Insulin dose was kept constant. Mean plasma glucose on the low-fiber diet was 169.4 +/- 11.7 mg/dl, significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than the value of 120.8 +/- 10.1 on the high-fiber diet. Hypoglycemic reactions were more common on the high-fiber diet. Weight remained essentially constant on both diets. Mean serum glucagon level on the high-fiber diet was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) than on the low-fiber diet, while serum free insulin levels were unchanged. These data indicate that substantial changes in fiber content of the diabetic diet may lead to marked changes in diabetic control and that increasing dietary fiber may be a useful means of lowering plasma glucose in some diabetic patients.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, we studied 122 consecutive clinically stable patients with angiographically defined CAD (greater than 75 per cent luminal stenosis) and a positive exercise test. Seventy-eight patients had pain or anginal equivalent during or after a positive exercise test; 44 did not, including 32 (26 per cent) with no symptoms at all. Patients were evaluated as to age, sex, prior myocardial infarction, congestive failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and digoxin or propranolol therapy--in addition to anginal symptoms before, during, or after the exercise itself. Extent of CAD, presence of collaterals, and left ventricular ejection fraction were also determined. All exercise tests were evaluated for evidence of ST-T abnormalities or prior infarction on the control ECG as well as peak heart rate during exercise and post-exercise degree of ST segment depression. There were no significant differences between patients with and without exercise-induced pain in regard to any of the clinical and angiographic features noted above, demonstrating that 'silent' myocardial ischemia during or after exercise testing is not uncommon and is not readily attributable to any obvious clinical or catheterization findings. Further studies are necessary to determine if patients with evidence of 'silent' myocardial ischemia are especially prone to sudden death.</AbstractText>"}

Careful questioning of the patient usually elicits other symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, such as impotence, urinary and fecal incontinence, constipation or diarrhea, blurred vision, or sweating changes. Drugs are the most common cause of autonomic dysfunction, and their benefits should be weighed against the severity of the dysfunction. In addition, diabetes mellitus, uremia, amyloidosis, acute intermittent porphyria, myeloma, tabes dorsalis, and alcohol-nutritional problems may produce symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Thus, patients who present with autonomic features but no history of dysfunction-producing drugs should undergo complete laboratory evaluation. A regimen of tyramine or L-dopa or a diet rich in cheese, processed meats, and wine (a monoamine), coupled with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor have beneficial effects in patients with orthostatic hypotension due to preganglionic autonomic dysfunction. Patients who do not respond to catecholamine precursors have stable, isolated orthostatic hypotension or a polyneuropathy such as that caused by diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

This difference was statistically significant (P less than 0,001). The results show that CDP-choline can protect surfactant from damage caused by alloxane-induced diabetes.

In six of the diabetics glucose output was accelerated almost five-fold during the intrabrachial arterial administration of metaproterenol (1.62 nmol/min), indicating that basal glucose release from muscle may result from enhanced glycogenolysis during acute insulin deficiency. In line with this view a reduction of glucose uptake by muscle was observed in six healthy subjects receiving metaproterenol infusion. However, since the production of lactate by the forearm appeared to be smaller in the diabetics, the basal glucose output could also partly be due to impaired glycolysis. These data suggest that the glucose released from muscle during acute insulin deficiency may be of clinical importance, especially when the rate of glycogenolysis is further stimulated by, for example, enhanced catecholamine drive.</AbstractText>"}

The amount of insular amyloid was quantified, and diabetic monkeys averaged eight times more islet amyloid than did normal monkeys. The quantity of insular amyloid correlated significantly with glucose clearance in intravenous glucose tolerance tests and with serum glucose, triglycerides, immunoreactive insulin, and prebetallipoprotein measured after an overnight fast. As with human beings, insular amyloid appeared to be more prevalent in aging monkeys. The results support the hypothesis that the interrelated islet pathologic and metabolic events, which result in the appearance of insular amyloid concomitant with islet cell necrosis, may contribute more to maturity-onset diabetes in aging individuals than has been heretofore realized.</AbstractText>"}

A double-blind crossover design was utilized during a 3-mo period in which clofibrate treatment (1 g b.i.d.) was compared to that of a lactose placebo (1 g b.i.d.). Our results demonstrate that clofibrate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the concentration of plasma glucose, ketone bodies, free fatty acids, triglyceride, and cholesterol in diabetic man. These beneficial effects were observed without demonstrable changes in circulating concentrations of insulin and glucagon. These observations suggest that in ketosis-prone diabetic man, clofibrate therapy may provide an adjunct to exogenous insulin administration.</AbstractText>"}

The literature data show that this disease is associated the clotting and fibrinolytic systems as a result of the prevalence of thrombogenic factors and/or poor inhibitor activity. A survey is made of fibrinolysis activators and inhibitors, and of the part played by lipids in the aetiopathogenesis of thrombophilia, though the mechanisms responsible have not yet been fully established. Reference is made to De Gaetano's exposition of Walsh's views concerning the rôle of platelets in clotting. An assessment is made of the relations between platelets and lipoproteins, and hence of the importance of platelets in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Reference is made to a series of atherosclerotic diabetics. Hyperaggregability was noted in 60% of 30 cases. The experimental results obtained by Bierman et al. on the relation between insulin and lipoproteinlipase and the interference of insulin with PHLA are presented in an explanation of the clarifying power of plasma in this disease. Lastly, an account is given of lipoproteinlipase values observed in a personal series of 48 cases employing a radioimmunological technique. Baselines were depressed in 24 subjects.</AbstractText>"}

The technical complications of necrosis, bleeding, and perforation of the transplanted duodenum and disruption of the duodenalenteric anastomosis can all be managed by immediate removal of the allograft at the first sign of rejection. While there is increasing evidence that islet cells are more violently rejectedly in the human than are some other transplanted tissues, it is not clear whether this is true with the organ pancreas transplant. The four relatively long-term successes of organ pancreas transplants in the human would suggest that the organ transplant may act more like a kidney transplant than do islet cells. In the author's opinion, many of the problems may be technical, and carefully controlled, staged whole or partial pancreas allografts in the human still hold promise for ultimate better long-term success.</AbstractText>"}

The precise shape and height of the lithium curve depend on gastric emptying, which can be slowed with propantheline or speeded with metoclopramide. Depressed or demented patients may be irregular in taking their tablets and variable in food intake. Both the time of the blood test and this behaviour must be considered before changing the prescribed dose of lithium salt because of a laboratory result. A lithium tolerance curve may be a safer guide to treatment than single measures.Mild intermittent thirst is a common early side effect, and severe persistent thirst with polyuria is an uncommon later effect of daily intakes of at least 1,500 mg lithium carbonate. This diabetes insipidus is reversible, non-progressive, unrelated to plasma level, and distinct in attack from lithium-induced hypothyroidism, which may occur at low dosage but is also usually of late onset and reversible or treatable with thyroxine while lithium is continued. Obesity is another occasional effect of large doses. These side effects and the antimanic and prophylactic effects may have different mechanisms.</AbstractText>"}

Pancreatctomy causes severe diabetes with hyperkaliemic acidosis which is always fatal with 72 hours. Auto or allotransplantation cures the diabetes within two to three days, and maintains normal glucose balance for about 60 days. Early death after transplantation occurred when the graft was totally ineffective. After transplantation, the blood sugar rose progressively towards the 15th day, then suddenly and definetely at the time of necrosis of the graft towards the 15th or 21st day. The follow up in some transplanted animals exceeded two months. The interest of the procedure resides in the implantation of a large critical mass (25 to 30% of the pancreas ) in a well-vascularised area, drained by the portal system, and permitting the digestive tract elimination of the pancreatic necrosis whether of vascular or immune origin.</AbstractText>"}

The automatic peritoneal dialysis cycler and the reverse osmosis peritoneal dialysis machine have been other development that made chronic peritoneal possible. Chronic peritoneal dialysis is indicated for the children, the elderly, those without hemodialysis access sites, those living along (for home dialysis) and the diabetics, whose retinopathy seems to progress less on peritoneal dialysis than on hemodialysis. Patients awaiting a kidney transplant can be maintained equally satisfactorily on peritoneal dialysis as on hemodialysis. Because of its simplicity almost any patient can be trained for home peritoneal dialysis, and a high incidence of rehabilitation can be achieved. A flow rate of 4 1/hr with 21 exchanges, 40 hours a week, seem to the ideal dialysis requirements. Complications of chronic peritoneal dialysis include those related to the permanent catheter such as one or two way obstruction and those related the dialysis itself. The latter can be either acute (i.e. peritonitis etc.) or chornic such as neuropathy, renal osteodystrophy, anemia etc. Integrated with hemodialysis and transplantation, peritoneal provides the nephrologists with the ability to treat his patients with the most appropriate treatment.</AbstractText>"}

All homozygous animals (db/db) develop obesity, elevated blood sugar levels and increased or normal blood insulin concentration. The defects in cellular immunity in db/db mice and their littermate controls were examined both in vivo and in vitro. Significant suppression of delayed footpad swelling and first and second set skin allograft rejection time were observed. In addition, DNA synthesis in spleen cells after nonspecific mitogen stimulation was markedly inhibited. Diabetic animals with a mean blood sugar of 512 +/- 101 mg/100 ml did not respond to exogenous insulin therapy by lowering their blood sugar levels or reversing the defect in DNA synthesis. Adding insulin to spleen cell culture in vitro had no demonstrable effect on their response to mitogens. Thus, mutation diabetic mice with their known defect in the peripheral utilization of insulin have markedly suppressed cell-mediated immune mechanisms.</AbstractText>"}

One sibling died at age 20 with fulminant diabetic ketoacidosis. The other two affected siblings are identical twin sisters without clinical diabetes but with an abnormality in the metabolism of exogenously administered glucose. These twins also have abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary control of prolactin and possibly of growth-hormone secretion. This study extends the previous reports of endocrine deficienceis associated with Friedreich's ataxia. The mechanisms underlying this association are undetermined but could represent pleiotropic effects of the Friedreich's ataxia gene or secondary manifestations of the primary central nervous system degeneration, or both.</AbstractText>"}

A declining L/S ratio was observed in 6 per cent of the cases without adverse effects on the fetus. No significant difference in the percentage of mature L/S ratios by weeks of pregnancy was found in the different classes of diabetes. An immature L/S ratio was associated with a significant increase of low Apgar scores. At each stage of pregnancy, there was no significant difference in the percentage of mature L/S ratios according to the sex of the baby nor according to the presence or absence of polyhydramnios. Among the five infants with HMD two had a mature L/S ratio within 2 days of birth. This represents 3 per cent incidence of false-positive results. Despite this finding, we feel that the determination of L/S ratio is a useful advance in the management of diabetic pregnancies.</AbstractText>"}

Survival rates at one, two and three years for 38 first cadaver transplants matched for a haplotype and 34 first live related donor haplotype matched kidneys were virtually the same. In addition, nine, four antigen matched cadaver transplants had a comparable survival rate at one, two and three years to the larger group of 25 HL-A identical live related donor kidneys. When poor risk cadaver recipients were excluded from the entire cadaver group, the graft survival rate approached that of the live related group at one year but declined more rapidly at two and three years than did the live related donor group. Thus, cadaver renal transplantation in this series appears to be an alternative to comparably matched live related donor transplants. An increased effort should be made to identify and use brain death cadaver donors for transplantation. As more donors become available and national sharing systems are improved, a strong case can be made to avoid the use of live related donor kidneys, except in instances of a perfect match.</AbstractText>"}

Blood glucose levels were elevated within 4 days after infection and reached a maximum mean level of 320 mg/100 ml within 12 days. Approximately 60-80% of the animals developed a transient hyperglycemia while 10-15% of the animals remained hyperglycemic for well over 6 mo. The remaining animals failed to become hyperglycemic but many had abnormal glucose tolerance curves. Hyperglycemia was most pronounced when animals were allowed free access to food, and the incidence of byperglycemia was related both to the strain and sex of the animals, with few females developing hyperglycemia. The amount of immunoreactive insulin in the plasma of infected hyperglycemic mice was significantly lower than in appropriate controls, and injection of exogenous insulin resulted in a rapid drop in the blood glucose levels. Despite the fact that certain animals were hyperglycemic for many months, virus could not be recovered from the pancreas after the first 10 days of the infection.</AbstractText>"}

This paper reports the results of a follow-up study and the high prevalence has been confirmed. In this survey of 417 people aged ten years and over, 9.8% were known diabetics. With a plasma glucose of 160 mg/100 ml or over at two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load as the criterion of diagnosis, , diabetes was detected in a further 19.2%, making a total diabetic population of 29% in the population studied. The prevalence of diabetes was 44% in people aged 20 years and over. A further 7% had borderline diabetes on the basis of a two-hour plasma glucose of 140--159 mg/100 ml. Parity did not appear to be a causative factor in relation to the high diabetes prevalence. However, obesity is common in this community and is more marked than that seen in other Pacific or Caucasian communities. The high prevalence of diabetes in this population appears to be related to the inter-action of environmental factors, such as obesity, with a diabetic genotype. The results confirm the possible detrimental effects of westernization on native populations.</AbstractText>"}

Plasma glucose and immunoreactive insulin levels were measured and animals were sacrificed at intervals for morphologic studies of pancreatic islets and measurements of extractable pancreatic immunoreactive insulin. Light microscopy revealed striking insulitis, 5 to 6 days after streptozotocin injections, with cell necrosis and eventual islet atrophy due to beta-cell necrosis, and numerous type C viruses within many of the surviving beta-cells. Light microscopic immunoperoxidase stains of islet cell hormones and electron microscopy identified relatively increased numbers of alpha- and delta-cells within the atrophic islets 6 and 12 months after streptozotocin injections. Plasma  glucose, plasma immunoreactive insulin, and extractable pancreatic immunoreactive insulin measurements documented the persistence of profound hyperglycemia, as well as the reduction of plasma and pancreatic immunoreactive insulin levels. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the absence of circulating islet cell antibodies during both the acute and chronic stages of the syndrome. The pathogenesis of this model of insulin-deficient diabetes is believed to be a cell-mediated autoimmune reaction directed against pancreatic beta-cells altered by subdiabetogenic injections of streptozotocin. The importance of the increased number of type C viruses within surviving beta-cells remains obscure.</AbstractText>"}

Groups of normal and Streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals were either given saline as a control, methylprednisilone as an exogenous steroid, or adrenocorticotrophin to stimulate endogenous steroid production. Plasma and urine ketone determinations were made daily for six days at which time animals were necropsied. The qualitative procedure used failed to detect ketonemia, and ketonuria was only found in diabetic guinea pigs treated with steroids. The results support the hypothesis that the absence of ketosis in spontaneously diabetic guinea pigs may be the result of a relative glucocorticoid insufficiency secondary to fatty degeneration of the adrenal glands, a common lesion in spontaneously diabetic guinea pigs.</AbstractText>"}

SRIF antiserum was raised in rabbits followin immunization with synthetic SRIF coupled with human serum alpha-globulin and did not cross-react with hypothalamic, pituitary or gastrointestinal hormones using our immunoassay method. In the control rats, SRIF-containing cells were scattered in the periphery of the islets in close proximity to the outer glucagon containing cells. These latter cells were distributed in the outermost periphery of the islets. Insulin-containing cells were located in the central portion of the islets and dominantly occupied most of the islet. In the streptozotocin-diabetic rat, SRIF-containing cells were significantly increased in number whereas insulin-containing cells were markedly reduced. It is suggested from these findings that the number as well as the distribution of SRIF-, insulin- and glucagon-containing cells was important to the physiological and pathophysiological functioning of the islet.</AbstractText>"}

But insulin secretion can be provoked by other specific stimuli. However, the quantitative IRI response can provide no information as to which of the MO diabetics must be treated by dietetic measures only and which of them are liable to treatment with sulfonylurea. It was, therefore, investigated whether in 109 patients suffering from recently developed overt MOD a differentiation from a therapeutical point of view can be attained by joint evaluation of stimulated IRI secretion, of glucose tolerance, of the dynamics of free fatty acids, of the fasting values of triglycerides and cholesterol and of the body weight. The findings suggest that no better differentiation for the two methods of treatment of MOD stated above is possible by simultaneous evaluation of the parameters of fat metabolism, glucose level and IRI secretion than by IRI secretion and carbohydrate tolerance alone.</AbstractText>"}

Two forms can be distinguished: a latent one (65%), in which the changes are predominantly electrocardiographic, and a clinical form (35%) with the features of congestive cardiomyopathy, notable for the rapidity of onset after right heart failure, the degree of cardiomegaly, the constant finding of abnormalities of ventricular repolarisation, the relative frequency of latent disorders of supra-His atrio-ventricular conduction, and the finding of elongation of the isovolumic contraction time on the phonomechanocardiogram. A haemodynamic profile is the same as for non-obstructive hypotonic cardiomyopathies, and is usually associated with a slow rise in left ventricular pressure. The cardiomyopathy, which is the most frequent cause of death, determines the prognosis in this condition. It may be found in association with diabetes and gonad failure. The finding of cardiomyopathy indicates basic treatment by veresection, which may be the only means of establishing a favourable outcome.</AbstractText>"}

This rise coincided with a rise in plasma-osmolality. In non-diabetic controls, however, plasma-potassium fell after the glucose drink. Osmotic and hormonal mechanisms may account for the rise in plasma-potassium in the diabetics.

The average concentration of Hb AIc was 11.4% in untreated diabetics as compared with 4.3% in healthy controls. With prolonged optimal regulation of blood glucose Hb AIc slowly decreased to a mean concentration of 5.5%. The concentration of Hb AIc was significantly correlated with the fasting blood sugar value. The findings suggest that determining Hb AIc may give valuable information on the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in the preceding one to two months and thus become an important aid to management.</AbstractText>"}

Persons of normal weight without diabetes (12) and obese persons without diabetes (18) were compared with obese diabetics (19). Fasting serum ketone levels were measured, and the plasma potassium, triglyceride and growth hormone responses during the glucose tolerance test were determined. Obese subjects without diabetes had a twofold greater total plasma insulin response (area under curve) than their counterparts of normal weight, but there was a progressive fall in total plasma insulin response from subjects with mild diabetes (with fasting normoglycaemia) to those with severe diabetes (with fasting hyperglycaemia). The early plasma insulin responses of the group with mild diabetes were significantly impaired, and the peak response was only reached at 120 minutes. The subjects with severe diabetes had a flat insulin response curve. Fasting serum ketone levels were highest in the group with severe diabetes. The growth hormone responses were similar in all the groups. Plasma potassium and tryglyceride levels fell less during the glucose tolerance test in the group with severe diabetes than in the other three groups. These data indicate that insulin secretion is reduced in obese Blacks with chemical evidence of diabetes and this reduction becomes severe in the symptomatic diabetic.</AbstractText>"}

Prolactin levels were significantly higher (alpha = 0.05) at the 120th minute in male diabetics and under basal conditions and at the 60th minute in female controls. There was no correlation with retinopathy, age and control of diabetes. At the 30th minute, prolactin levels were higher when diabetes was of more recent onset. These results confirm the absence of any participation of prolactin in the development of retinopathy, although variations in prolactin may be seen in association with the presence of diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

In cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes mellitus, a statistically significant rise in the third fraction has been found. In patients with tumors of the pancreatic A-cells, in addition to the third fraction the second in particular was also increased: it may be a precursor of the glucagon molecule. In chronic renal insufficiency, fractions 2 and 3 were as markedly increased as in glucagonoma, which suggests a role for the kidney in the decomposition of glucagon. The pathophysiologic significance of the four immunoreactive fractions of glucagon cannot yet be assessed with certainty.</AbstractText>"}

Study of islet-cell function ten months after ingestion showed a reduced disappearance rate of intravenous glucose and depressed C-peptide response to intravenous glucose when compared with a normal control but no impairment of glucagon release after intravenous arginine stimulation. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated severe sensory and mild motor neuropathy. Quadriceps capillary basement membrane thickness was in the diabetic range. Because at least 15 similar occurrences have been reported to the manufacturer, this agent appears to be diabetogenic in man, probably causing beta-cell destruction. Niacinamide, which can prevent glucose intolerance in both streptozocin- and alloxan-treated animals and prevents death in rats given this rodenticide, may be a useful antidote.</AbstractText>"}

Sodium dichloroacetate (1mM) inhibited glucose production from L-lactate in kidney-cortex slices from fed, starved or alloxan-diabetic rates. In general gluconeogenesis from other substrates was no inhibited. 2. Sodium dichloracetate inhibited glucose production from L-lactate but no from pyruvate in perfused isolated kidneys from normal or alloxan-diabetic rats. 3. Sodium dichloroacetate is an inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction and it effected conversion of pyruvate dehydrogenase into its its active (dephosphorylated) form in kidney in vivo. In general, pyruvate dehydrogenase was mainly in the active form in kidneys perfused or incubated with L-lactate and the inhibitory effect of dichloroacetate on glucose production was not dependent on activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. 4. Balance data from kidney slices showed that dichloroacetate inhibits lactate uptake, glucose and pyruvate production from lactate, but no oxidation of lactate. 5. The mechanism of this effect of dichloroactetate on glucose production from lactate has not been fully defined, but evidence suggests that it may involve a fall in tissue pyruvate concentration and inhibition of pyruvate carboxylation.</AbstractText>"}

Rat neurohypophysial extracts have been examined by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 2. Three of the proteins were tentatively identified as neurophysins by their acidic nature and their disappearance after dehydration of the animals. 3. These proteins were radioactive 24h after intracisternal injection of [(35)S]cysteine. 4. Two of the proteins were present in much greater quantities than the third, and these two were present in the gland in the same ratio as the hormones vasopressin and oxytocin. 5. One of these proteins was absent from glands of rats homozygous for diabetes insipidus but present in heterozygous animals. 6. It is suggested that these two proteins are the vasopressin-neurophysin and oxytocin-neurophysin of the rat.</AbstractText>"}

Neither of these patients had peripheral vascular disease or peripheral neuropathy. There was a proliferative diabetic retinopathy with hemorrhages and exudates in one patient and only background diabetic changes in the ocular fundi of the other; there have been no significant changes in visual acuity or retinopathy in either patient following the transplantation. Both have good kidney function after 8 and 15 months and are completely rehabilitated.The requirement for insulin decreased in both patients during the period of renal insufficiency and increased following transplantation; this seemed to be related to the large dose of steroids given because now that a maintenance level of steroids has been established, both patients require the same dosage of insulin as they did before the onset of renal insufficiency.</AbstractText>"}

Peripheral neuropathy is the most common (average frequency 26%). The main clinical, anatomical, histological and pathogenetic features of polyneuritis in diabetes are illustrated. Diabetic amyotrophy is a true clinical entity, though its site (neural or muscular) and pathogenesis are still the subject of discussion. Cranial nerve damage (oculomotor paralysis in particular) has the typical clinical, anatomical and histological picture of peripheral forms. Myelopathy leads to three distinct anatomical and clinical patterns: pseudo-tabes caused by degeneration of the roots and posterior cords; chronic anterior poliomyelitis due to degeneration of the cells of the anterior cornua; myelosis attributable to combined degeneration of the posterior and anterolateral cords. The main features of encephalopathy and the relation between epilepsy and diabetes are also examined.</AbstractText>"}

To investigate its metabolic effects in man, we administered oral doses (3 to 4 g) of dichloroacetate as the sodium salt to patients with diabetes mellitus or hyperlipoproteinemia or both for six to seven days. Dichloroacetate significantly reduced fasting hyperglycemia an average of 24 per cent (P less than 0.01) from base line and produced marked, concomitant falls in plasma lactate (73 per cent; P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) and alanine (82 per cent; P less than 0.01 to less than 0.001). In addition, it significantly decreased plasma cholesterol (22 per cent; P less than 0.01 to less than 0.001) and triglyceride (61 per cent; P less than 0.01) levels while increasing (71 per cent; P less than 0.01) plasma ketone-body concentrations.

(M-Ms value) and by Molnar, Service et Al. (MAGE, MODD, MBG and FBG values). However these methods, partly derived from the results of continuous blood monitoring, fail to give qualitative information about the glycemic daily profile. In order to obtain a more complete estimation of the diurnal blood sugar curve, a simple set of three indices is introduced by our group: 1) the Mbs value (modified); 2) the mean difference (delta value) of the various Mbs/bs calculated with a HP 25 Hewlett-Packard, and 3) the mean of the differences, exceeding delta, which are between contiguous Mbs/bs (M delta value). This investigation was carried out in 103 diabetic observations, on the basis of eight blood-sugar daily determinations (Destrostix Reflectance Meter) on two successive twenty-four-hour periods, under standard conditions of diet, exercise and therapeutic regimen. As the results show, modified Mbs describes the mean level of the glycemic profile; delta indicates the amplitude of the glycemic variability field; M delta reports both maximal and minimal extremes of the curve. A correlation of these parameters is expressed by a formula, which might distinguish stable from unstabel ('brittle') diabetes and allow clinical comparison in different treatment conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Plasma glucagon in 6 normal control subjects fell significantly after the administration of glucose, whereas the levels of plasma glucagon did not decrease after glucose ingestion in patients with diabetes mellitus. In the group with severe diabetes, whose fasting blood glucose exceeded 200 mg/100 ml, the plasma glucagon level rose after glucose administration instead of decreasing. In 6 patients with diabetes mellitus, plasma glucagon did not decrease but rather increased during a glucose tolerance test which was performed after treatment with insulin and/or diet. In 6 control subjects, there was a remarkable rise of plasma glucagon in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In contrast, no significant rise in plasma glucagon was demonstrated in 19 diabetic subjects undergoing intravenous insulin test. Seven patients, in whom an insulin test was repeated after treatment with insulin, sulfonylurea, or diet had a small rise in peak plasma glucagon and an increase in the integrated area under the glucagon response curve. It is concluded that the abnormal glucagon response to changes in blood glucose might be a primary defect in diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

Growth records of 252 children with insulin-dependent diabetes who have been under continuous observation in our clinic at three- to five-month intervals for at least three years and up to 16 years have been individually reviewed and analyzed. All children received two daily injections of a mixture of two parts of an intermediate to one part of regular insulin and were instructed to eat structured meals of high-quality selected foods. An over-all rating for diabetic control based primarily on the frequency and degree of glycosuria was made for the time period between clinic visits. The over-all diabetic control rating and the size of the subgroups were 'good'--20 per cent, 'fair to good'--64 per cent, and 'fair'--16 per cent. All children maintained in 'good' and 'fair to good' control (84 per cent), grew and matured at a normal rate regardless of the age at onset or duration of diabetes. All children in lower degrees of control coming under care for greater than 24 months after diagnosis had accelerated growth during the early months after attaining a higher degree of control.</AbstractText>"}

As compared with a standard OGTT, the peak blood glucose, expressed as per cent change from baseline, was particularly blunted by pectin or by cellulose phosphate but remained unchanged with cellulose supplementation. The time interval required to reach the blood glucose peak was significantly prolonged with pectin. The rate of blood glucose rise was reduced to a greater extent by pectin than by cellulose phosphate, which in turn was more efficient than cellulose. The blood glucose nadir expressed as per cent change from baseline was blunted by pectin, while the results were not significantly different after addition of either cellulose phosphate or cellulose. On the other hand, the plasma immunoreactive insulin did not show any significant change whether the glucose was given with or without one of the aforementioned types of fiber. From these results, it is concluded that an additional fiber intake may be of interest in the management of chemical diabetes. The use of pectin may diminish the poststimulative hypoglycemia.</AbstractText>"}

The activities in rat tissues of 3-oxo acid CoA-transferase (the first enzyme involved in acetoacetate utilization) were found to be highest in kidney and heart. In submaxillary and adrenal glands the activities were about one-quarter of those in kidney and heart. In brain it was about one-tenth and was less in lung, spleen, skeletal muscle and epididymal fat. No activity was detectable in liver. 2. The activities of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase were found roughly to parallel those of the transferase except for liver and adrenal glands. The high activity in the latter two tissues may be explained by additional roles of thiolase, namely, the production of acetyl-CoA from fatty acids. 3. The activities of the two enzymes in tissues of mouse, gerbil, golden hamster, guinea pig and sheep were similar to those of rat tissues. The notable exception was the low activity of the transferase and thiolase in sheep heart and brain. 4. The activities of the transferase in rat tissues did not change appreciably in starvation, alloxan-diabetes or on fat-feeding, where the rates of ketone-body utilization are increased. Thiolase activity increased in kidney and heart on fat-feeding. 5. The activity of 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase did not change in rat brain during starvation. 6. The factors controlling the rate of ketone-body utilization are discussed. It is concluded that the activities of the relevant enzymes in the adult rat do not control the variations in the rate of ketone-body utilization that occur in starvation or alloxan-diabetes. The controlling factor in these situations is the concentration of the ketone bodies in plasma and tissues.</AbstractText>"}

Azide and cyanide increased glucose C-1 oxidation by normal leukocytes but had little or no effect on myeloperoxidase-deficient leukocytes suggesting that these agents normally stimulate glucose C-1 oxidation, in part, by inhibition of myeloperoxidase. It is suggested that the inhibition or absence of myeloperoxidase results in an increased utilization of H(2)O(2) in nonmyeloperoxidase-mediated H(2)O(2)-dependent reactions such as formate oxidation and hexose monophosphate pathway activation. The possibility of a microbicidal control mechanism in which a decrease in the microbicidal activity of myeloperoxidase is offset, in part, by an increase in the nonenzymatic microbicidal activity of H(2)O(2) is considered.</AbstractText>"}

We have treated 10 patients with HCF diets on a metabolic ward and followed them for an average of 15 months while they were on maintenance diets at home. The HCF diets containing 70 per cent of calories as carbohydrate were accompanied by significant reductions in requirements for insulin or sulfonylureas. Fasting plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, and triglyceride values were significantly lower on the HCF diet than on a 43 per cent carbohydrate diet. On the HCF diet, insulin therapy was discontinued for five patients and sulfonylurea therapy for three. After an average of 15 months on the maintenance diet containing 55 per cent to 60 per cent carbohydrate, seven patients were still managed without insulin or sulfonylureas. Average fasting plasma glucose values during maintenance diets at home were identical to values on the HCF diets in the hospital. On the maintenance diet, serum cholesterol values were similar to initial values but serum triglyceride values were significantly lower than values on the 43 per cent carbohydrate diet. These studies indicate that moderately high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diets can be successfully followed at home and that improvements in glucose metabolism achieved in the hospital can be sustained outside the hospital.</AbstractText>"}

It seems that even non-obese Nigerian diabetics may remit despite a free diet and initial need for insulin. The reasons for diabetic remissions remain largely unexplained but may be related, in Nigeria, to the aetiological nature of diabetes mellitus in this part of the world.</AbstractText>"}

Insulin has no direct effect on glucose utilization. The glucokinase activity of the capillary endothelium is undetectable and the plasma cell membrane is freely permeable to glucose. All pathways of glucose utilization are stimulated by a high ambient glucose concentration: intracellular sorbitol accumulation and glucose-carbon incorporation into basement membrane collagen are most sensitive to the glucose effect. During chronic hyperglycemia, the amino acid composition of the basement membrane is modified and its capacity to incorporate glucose is enhanced. The glucose induced alterations of the blood capillary metabolism may contribute to the development of the diabetic microangiopathy.</AbstractText>"}

Despite moderately good control of blood glucose, all four patients had markedly elevated concentrations of blood lactate (12h means of 2.1-2;4 mmol/1) with concentrations greater than 3 mmol/1 at some time during the day. Hepatic function was normal in all patients and in all four patients plasma creatinine was 80-85 mumol/1, (normal range 60-125 mumol/1) so that the usual indications for not using biguanides were absent. It is concluded that diabetics with retinopathy constitute a group of patients with an increased risk of phenformin-associated lactic acidosis, and that plasma creatinine estimation may be unreliable in assessing whether patients are suitable for phenformin therapy.</AbstractText>"}

This lesion, found in various normal and pathological states, has generated numerous pathogenic hypotheses. The presence of microangiopathy in 5 groups of 50 subjects representing five different clinical conditions, subjects over 60 years old or less than 40, diabetics, latent diabetics or patients with severe coronary heart disease, together with microscopic and/or ultrastructural lesions of the connective tissue (fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibers, ground substance) has enabled us to propose a pathogenic hypothesis applicable to any microangiopathy. The initial change, hereditary or acquired, would be fibroblastic or interstitial. It would be characterized by the accumulation of glycoproteins, proteoglyacans and soluble collagen in the interstitium. Incomplete drainage of these macromolecules would occur around the blood and lymphatic capillaries and manifest itself by a PAS deposit, the hallmark of the microangiopathy.</AbstractText>"}

There were 24 myocardial ruptures (9.5%). Previous history of arterial hypertension and un-remittent anginal pain were predisposing factors for rupture (p=0.05). Other previously reported bad prognostic factors such as persistent hipertension after acute infarction, severe exercise before infarction and history of Diabetes Mellitus were not statistically significant in this study. Ruptured myocardium was not influenced by a previous history of myocardial infarction, hospitalization delay in the C.C.U., administration of anticoagulants, digitalis or pressor amines. There was no significant difference among the groups compared in enzyme curves or magnitude of leucocytosis. Electromechanic dissociation, sinus bradycardia, nodal rhythm followed by idioventricular rhythm and asystole, were observed following myocardial rupture.</AbstractText>"}

In the Bedford Survey, systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in newly detected diabetics and borderline diabetics, both men and women, than in normoglycaemic controls after adjustment of blood pressures for age and BMI. However, in the stratified random sample of the cooperating Bedford population, only amongst women was the blood sugar significantly and independently correlated with the systolic blood pressure. Evidence is presented and discussed that autonomic, neurohumoral factors may play some part in the pathogenesis of maturity onset diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

The inter-assay coefficient of variation was 4% and that for intra-assay measurements 3%, over the range 5-20%, HbA1(a+b+c). The method confirmed that the level of HbA1(a+b+c) is elevated in imperfectly controlled diabetics. Amongst patients with blood glucose levels of less than 10 mmol/l the mean level of HbA1(a+b+c) was found to be 8.5%; samples from 14 known diabetics gave a mean value of 10.9%, whereas 17 known non-diabetic samples gave a mean value of 8.3%. In the group of samples from 27 diabetic individuals with blood glucose levels above 10 mmol/l the mean level of HbA1(a+b+c) was found to be 13.5%.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":658633,"Title":"Branched chain amino acid metabolism in the retina of diabetic rats.","Journal":"Diabetologia","Date":"Mar 1978","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Diabetes is known to produce increased levels of the branched chain amino acids in plasma, heart and muscle as well as increased oxidation of [14C]-leucine by nerves and muscles from rats. Plasma and retinas from streptozotocin diabetic rats had significant elevations in branched chain amino acid levels compared to control. Retinas from diabetic rats have been found to oxidize significantly more of the branched chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine than did control retinas when incubated in media containing 16.5 mmol/l glucose. Neither the extracellular space nor the tissue pool of leucine was significantly different in the two groups. The addition of 19 amino acids, at normal plasma concentrations, to the incubation media resulted in 80 percent suppression of leucine oxidation without significant change in incorporation of [14C] into protein. These results suggest that the major role for the branched chain amino acids in the rat retina is in protein synthesis which is not affected by short-term diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

Different degrees of retinopathy were seen in 75% of the patients. No significant correlation between the presence of specific HLA alleles and the stage of retinopathy was found. We have discussed the possibility that all patients who develop diabetes have identical disease-predisposing genes, irrespective of their HLA alleles. If this was the case, the HLA phenotype would not determine the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.</AbstractText>"}

By contrast, in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment patients with diabetes mellitus, serum insulin was 35 +/- 5 microunits/ml and the subretinal fluid always contained low but detectable amojnts of insulin. The data may suggest a small leak of insulin into the subretinal fluid of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment patients with diabetic retinopathy.

In mild diabetics the serum cholesterol was significantly increased, while in severe diabetes the serum cholesterol was significantly lower than in mild diabetes. The decreased serum cholesterol in severe diabetes may be an indication for the development of fatty liver. The serum alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin were significantly increased in both the severe and mild diabetic states, while the thymol turbidity test was insignificantly changed in both states of diabetes. Serum albumin was significantly decreased in 10 days mild diabetes, while it was insignificantly changed in 48 hrs severe diabetic animals. The effect of ATP was investigated in mild diabetes. ATP resulted in a significant increase in serum albumin and a decrease in total globulins with the resultant increase in A/G ratio. The serum alkaline phosphatase exhibited a significant reduction under the influence of ATP. The elevated cholesterol of mild diabetic rats remained significantly elevated and was not reduced by ATP, though the fat content of the liver showed a significant reduction. This may be due to more rapid mobilisation of fat from the liver under the influence of ATP. ATP showed no significant effect on serum bilirubin and thymol turbidity test. the histopathological examination of the liver revealed that administration of ATP to alloxan diabetic rats had a beneficial effect. It resulted in disappearrance of the fat globules from the liver cells.</AbstractText>"}

Nevertheless they have a major common pathway through hypertension, which may well be the most important consequence of a high-protein, high-carbohydrate, high-fat, high-energy and high-sodium diet. Because body fatness is a strongly genetically determined characteristic and because it evolves over the whole period of childhood a vigorous and sustained programme of health education is required at all levels. The aim of such a programme is to effect a small shift in the fatness of the whole population; such a shift would dramatically and disproportionately reduce the incidence of obesity. Since the morbidity and mortality which is found in obese subjects arises primarily from cardiovascular disease in general, and coronary heart disease in particular, nutritional influences have obvious relevance to the prevention of coronary heart disease.</AbstractText>"}

To elucidate the relationship of glucose-induced insulin secretion to pancreatic beta adrenergic receptors and the implications of this relationship with regards to abnormal insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus, two questions were studied. (a) To determine whether glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon beta adrenergic activity, the effect of beta adrenergic blockade with intravenous propranolol (0.08 mg/min) upon acute insulin responses to isoproterenol and glucose were compared in normal subjects. (b) To determine whether acute insulin responses to beta adrenergic stimulation were intact in diabetes mellitus, the effect of isoproterenol upon serum insulin levels was studied in diabetic subjects. Beta adrenergic blockade in the normal subjects obliterated acute insulin responses to isoproterenol (before: 361+/-270%, during: - 31+/-15%; n = 6, P &lt; 0.001) but did not significantly affect responses to glucose (before; 311+/-270%; during: 284+/-206%; n = 5). The mean acute insulin response after isoproterenol in the diabetic group was significantly elevated over basal levels (152+/-74%; n = 10, P &lt; 0.001) but the response after glucose was not (- 11+/-11%). These data suggest that insulin responses to glucose in normal subjects are mediated by specific pancreatic glucose receptors which are independent from beta adrenergic receptors and that abnormal glucose-induced insulin secretion in diabetics is due to defects within glucose receptors and not beta adrenergic receptors as has been previously hypothesized.</AbstractText>"}

There were 66 cases in all, representing 1.6% of the total series with an age range of 30--81 and a mean of 53.4 yr; 43 males to 23 females--a ratio of approximately 2 : 1. 34 cases (51.5%) were hypertensives all with a minimum diastolic pressure of 120 mm Hg before treatment. Congestive cardiomyopathy accounted for 16 cases (24.3%) and diabetes mellitus unassociated with other ailments for another 6 cases (9.1%). Other causes included mixed aortic valve disease with 2 cases (3%), endomyocardial fibrosis with 2 cases (3%). In 6 patients (9.1%), all above the age of 70, who had been admitted for minor surgical operations, no cause could be found. This etiological pattern differs from that seen in white populations where ischemic heart disease is by far the commonest cause. The extreme rarity to left anterior hemiblock in rheumatic mitral valve disease is considered of help in separating cases of lone rheumatic regurgitation from those of mitral regurgitation complicating congestive cardiomyopathy if and when diagnostic difficulty arises.</AbstractText>"}

The present study tested the hypothesis that there is an inherent cellular defect affecting viability of diabetic cells in insulin-dependent diabetes. Four insulin-dependent patients, aged 12 to 19 years, included two with joint contracture, skin changes, and growth failure; one with thyroiditis and past history of nephrosis; and one with a family history of insulin dependency. Ten control subjects, aged 10 to 52 years, had negative family histories and normal oral glucose tolerance tests. Number of cells per confluent dish correlated significantly with donor age (p less than 0.001) at 30 and 40 in-vitro generations. The patients' cells' mean confluent density did not differ from that of five age-matched controls. Plating efficiency correlated with donor age at 30 in-vitro generations ( p less than 0.001); plating efficiency of cells from the youngsters with diabetes was virtually identical to that of control cells at 20, 30, and 40 generations. In this small series of two subjects with in-vivo growth failure, one with associated autoimmune disease and another with familial insulin-dependent disease, cultured fibroblasts demonstrated normal viability and the hypothesis of a cellular growth defect was not confirmed.</AbstractText>"}

Glucose infusion (1.25 gm.) resulted in a slight elevation of serum insulin. When this amount of glucose was infused during the last 30 minutes of a two-and-a-half-hour infusion of a mixture of essential amino acids, there was a rapid and striking increase in serum insulin. However, this increase was not associated with a faster glucose disposal rate. The administration of this mixture of amino acids doubled the basal level of alpha-amino nitrogen, and during the first two hours, before glucose infusion, it caused a significant rise of serum insulin and HGH. In both cases glucose caused an increase of HGH secretion that was not significantly different in the two groups of infants.</AbstractText>"}

After triglyceride the responses of IRGIP were similar, but after galactose those of the diabetics were slightly exaggerated. Both stimuli evoked increments of plasma immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) in diabetics but not in normal subjects. Plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) did not change. In normal subjects given oral triglyceride or galactose followed by intravenous (I.V.) glucose the early-phase response of plasma IRI was enhanced and glucose tolerance improved. In the diabetics, oral triglyceride did not affect insulin release or glucose tolerance after I.V. glucose; oral galactose elicited a slight increase of insulin release without improving glucose tolerance. In the diabetics the rise of plasma IRG after ingestion of triglyceride or galactose was maintained after I.V. glucose. It is concluded that endogenous GIP is insulinotropic and that there is partial resistance to this action in diabetes. The results were compatible with feedback inhibition of GIP secretion by insulin and with the suggestion that the rise of plasma IRG associated with secretion of GIP in diabetics may be due to the glucagonotropic action of this peptide.</AbstractText>"}

Patients were on a mean dose of 550 U./day (range 200--2,000) of U-500 regular beef insulin. Mean maximum 125I-insulin-binding capacity was 191 mU./ml. serum (range 13--1,080). Mean in vivo half-life (T 1/2) of 125I-regular beef insulin was 614 minutes (range 114--1,300), as against a mean T 1/2 of 13.9 minutes (range 11.8--16.5) in normal controls. Treatment was successful in 34 patients and unsuccessful in one with lipoatrophic diabetes. The mean initial dose of sulfated insulin was 89 U./day (range 15--400) and at three months was 66 U./day (range 20--400). Twenty-eight patients who responded and survived have been on sulfated insulin for a mean of 39 months (range 2-66) and are on a mean dose of 25 U./day (range 0--100). The mean maximum binding capacity fell to 9 mU./ml. (range 0--34) during therapy (p less than 0.01). Mean 125I-insulin T 1/2 fell from 614 to 249 minutes after sulfated insulin therapy (p less than 0.001). A comparative study of 15 patients on consecutive days showed a 35 sulfated insulin T 1/2 of 60 minutes (range 15--94) and a mean 125I-regular insulin T 1/2 of 246 minutes (range 62--560, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that sulfated insulin is less antigenic than regular beef insulin and combines less avidly with human antibodies to regular beef insulin. The response to sulfated insulin therapy was significantly better than the response reported by other investigators to pork insulin or to steroid therapy in similar patients.</AbstractText>"}

Saline was infused during the first control period. Meals were served during the two 24-hour periods. Blood samples were taken hourly. Five normal males received a total dose of 4 mg. somatostatin. Four male diabetics received 2 mg., four received 4 mg., and four 6 mg. In the diabetics, somatostatin suppressed plasma growth hormone, glucagon, and glucose throughout the infusion. All parameters rebounded at cessation of infusion. In the normals, somatostatin suppressed plasma growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin but increased plasma glucose. It is concluded that the plasma glucose suppression in the diabetics is mainly due to the suppression of the diabetogenic hormones growth hormone and glucagon. A minor effect of decreased and/or delayed absorption of carbohydrates cannot be excluded in these experiments. The elevated plasma glucose levels in normals must be due to the suppressive effects of somatostatin on insulin secretion.</AbstractText>"}

Blood samples were obtained before and after arginine and glucagon administration and also following controlled exercise on the ergometer with 50% of the actual working capacity during 20 minutes. The presence of d. r. and its stage has been determined by fluorescein angiography. Our results demonstrate that an increased secretion of growth hormone in diabetics actually constitutes a manifestation of metabolic instability. Apparantly no correlation exists between the appearance of d. r. or its stage and the degree of growth hormone release.</AbstractText>"}

In vitro the inhibitor caused an almost complete block in ketone body production. In vivo (+)-decanoylcarnitine caused a rapid reversal of ketosis under conditions where large doses of insulin had little effect. A combination of the two agents produced an even more striking fall in plasma ketone levels.While (+)-decanoylcarnitine alone had no effect on plasma glucose levels it enhanced the hypoglycemic effect of insulin in anesthetized animals. Loss of this effect was noted in nonanesthetized animals, possibly as a result of increased muscle activity. Studies in the isolated perfused liver indicated that the blockade of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis produced by (+)-decanoylcarnitine was rapidly reversible upon removal of the inhibitor.</AbstractText>"}

The frequency of each i.o. pressure show no Gaussian distribution but is skewed to the right with marked excess to higher values of i.o. pressure. Correlation of mean i.o. pressure with age shows (starting in the group of the 20-24 years old to the 75-79 years old persons) a rather linear progression of i.o. pressure. The mean value of i.o. pressure (n = 17,798 eyes) was x = 16.25 mm Hg, the standard deviation +/- 3.45, the standard deviation of the mean +/- 0.03 mm Hg. In men in 2.18% in women in 1.81% higher i.o. pressure than 21 mm Hg was found. I.o. pressure higher than 24 mm Hg have 0.66% of the men and 0.58% of the women. Patients forty years old and elder showing in 4.92% of the men and 4.88% of the women higher i.o. pressure than 21 mm Hg. In patients fifty-five years old and elder in 5.75% of the men and respectively in 6.69% of the women i.o. pressure higher than 21 mm Hg was found. Incidences of elevated i.o. pressure from patients over forty years old in ten years steps are presented. In 103 patients with unilaterally i.o. pressure higher than 24 mm Hg 12% presents manifest diabetes mellitus. The usefullness of applanation tonometry as a practicable screening method for early glaucoma detection within medical diagnostic 'check-up' programs is outlined. Advantages of data-aquisition and -processing systems to continue those studies are emphasized.</AbstractText>"}

The mechanism of the antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus was studied in anaesthetized Brattleboro rats with the hereditary hypothalamic form of the disease. 2. The antidiuresis caused by acute administration of hydrochlorothiazide followed an increase in sodium excretion and was associated with a significant fall in the plasma sodium concentration. There were concomitant falls in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. 3. When sodium depletion was prevented by adjusting the infusion of sodium chloride, the falls in plasma sodium concentration, effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were abolished. Under these circumstances there was an increase in urine volume, which suggests that hydrochlorothiazide may inhibit fractional fluid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. 4. The results indicate that the antidiuresis caused by hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus results, at least in part, from falls in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. These in turn seem to be entirely secondary to the drug-induced sodium depletion.</AbstractText>"}

A prospective randomized study of two dietary regimens has been started in newly-diagnosed diabetics to determine their effect on circulating metabolites and on diabetic complications. 2. During the first year of treatment the fasting plasma glucose concentrations on both the low-carbohydrate diet and the high-carbohydrate, modified-fat (MF) diet showed a similar decrease. 3. Plasma cholesterol showed a sustained decrease only in patients recommended a MF diet. Transient changes in plasma triglyceride concentrations occurred in patients on both dietary regimens. 4. Increased plasma cholesterol levels are associated with atheromatous disease which is common in diabetics in Europe and North America. A MF diet may therefore have an advantage in that it lowers the plasma cholesterol as well as being effective in lowering the plasma glucose.</AbstractText>"}

The single patient who did not develop acute renal failure had no evidence of decreased insulin requirement. Eleven of 12 patients had decreased insulin requirement: mean  decrement in insulin dose, 40%; mean decrement in fasting blood glucose level, 33%; mean decrement in peak blood glucose level, 42%. The 12th patient underwent peritoneal dialysis against hypertonic glucose without need of an increased insulin dose. Eight of 11 patients experienced a total of 19 insulin reactions; one patient was hypoglycemic continuously, despite infusion of glucose and discontinuation of insulin. The decrement of insulin requirement was not proportional to the rise in either serum creatinine or potassium concentrations. We suggest that when acute renal failure occurs in diabetics, decreased insulin requirement should be anticipated and the insulin dose lowered.</AbstractText>"}

Diatrizoate meglumine was the contrast media used in all of the cases. These patients had an average age of 63 years and six were 55 years of age or older. Diabetes mellitus, negative fluid balance before the procedure, underlying renal insufficiency, and hypertension were common, being present in three, four, five, and six of the patients respectively . Anuria or oliguria occurred within 24 hours of the procedure and persisted from 36 to 96 hours (72 hours average). The serum creatinine level rose significantly in all of the patients and reached a peak in two to seven days after the procedure. In six patients, recovery was complete by two to three weeks. The seventh patient experienced only partial recovery. These cases taken together with a mounting number of recent reports suggest that contrast media-induced oliguric renal failure is more common than generally believed. Diabetes mellitus, older age, and underlying renal insufficiency seem to be important predisposing factors.</AbstractText>"}

Mean daily difference (MDD) had a unimodal distribution; 15 patients with a MDD greater than 100 mg/100 ml were classified as most brittle. There was no correlation between MDD and insulin requirement. The brittle diabetics received 26 to 48 units of insulin/day. The insulin-resistant patients had low MDD values. No difference was found between seven patients with brittle diabetes and seven stable matched controls in insulin-binding capacity or total insulin. In two groups of six patients each with brittle diabetes, it was found that the stable dosage caused less brittleness than a sliding-scale regimen and that routine injection of 4 units of regular insulin before meals slightly decreased the mean diurnal glycemia level but increased the number of hypoglycemias. In two brittle diabetics, the blood glucose level was stabilized on intravenously administered insulin infusion, and in these patients, meals caused only a moderate hyperglycemia.</AbstractText>"}

A significant rise in the percent of amniocenteses with meconium staining was found to occur at an beyond 39 weeks. Meconium-stained fluid at amniocentesis was found to be associated with an increased incidence of babies weighing greater than 4000 g, maternal diabetes mellitus, and cesarean deliveries, in comparison to samples with clear amniotic fluid. Infants with meconium-stained fluid had an increased incidence of low 1-minute Apgar scores, but all 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 or greater. Ten perinatal deaths occurred after an amniocentesis with clear fluid in prolonged pregnancy, with four of these occurring within 7 days of amniocentesis. Lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratios less than 2.0 were found in 6% of amniocenteses performed beyond 41 weeks. However, none of the newborns with low L/S ratios develop subsequent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Amniotic fluid creatine values or blood-contaminated fluid were not found to be correlated with fetal outcome. No fetal mortality was attributable to amniocentesis. In view of the significant amount of false-positive and false-negative results, and the rare inherent danger associated with amniocentesis, its use solely to demonstrate the presence or absence of meconium staining appears to be of questionable value in the management of prolonged pregnancy.</AbstractText>"}

Limited studies have suggested that the level of Hb Alc is proportional to the integrated concentration of glucose over time. Thus it could serve as an index of hyperglycemia. Its measurement may enable a more objective approach to assessing whether or not the control of hyperglycemia can be correlated with the severity of complications of diabetes. Large scale clinicab studies of Hb Alc have not been undertaken for lack of a rapid assay system. This article describes a method of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) which enables the isolation of Hb Alc in 27 min using only 12 microgram of Hb (100 microliter of blood) and a second method for the isolation of total fast Hb components (also elevated in diabetes) in 11 min. Using the first method, a total of 36 assays were performed on the blood of a single normal volunteer over a one month period. the mean level of Hb Alc was 4.95 +/- 0.12% (SD) +/- 0.02% (SEM), while the coefficient of variation (C.V.) was 2.4%. The mean Hb Alc &amp; b level was 1.65 +/- 0.06% +/- 0.01% (C.V. = 3.6%). Values for Hb Alc in 10 normal individuals were 5.06 (mean) +/- 0.32% (SD) +/- 0.01% (SEM). Hb Alc values in 15 patients with diabetes mellitus ranged from 6.8 to 20.0%. The second method was designed to assay Hb Ala, Hb Alb, and Hb Alc as a single peak and yielded results identical to the sum of these components as determined by the first method ( r = 0.98; p less than 0.001).</AbstractText>"}

Five patients with unstable diabetes were studied. The daily regimen consisted of four meals of equal carbohydrate, fat, and protein content taken at 8 A.M., 2 P.M., 8 P.M., and 2 A.M. and 1 hr of standardized exercise in the second postprandial hour (except after the 2 A.M. meal). Confirmation of physiologic replacement of insulin by the IVI program was possible because four patients had low insulin-binding antibodies and minimal distortion of serum IRI. Best glucose control was achieved by increasing the basal flow rate (mean, 0.15 mU/kg/min) 10-fold from 15 to 60 min after daytime meals and from 15 to 105 min after the 2 A.M. meal and doubling the basal rate overnight. Contrasted to the results with SCI, the IVI program significantly improved the mean blood glucose and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions. The IVI program restored the time to glucose peak and postprandial baseline glucose recovery to normal; the amplitude of glucose increase to peak remained somewhat greater than normal.</AbstractText>"}

Diabetics with the juvenile onset type of the disease were more adversely affected than those with the maturity onset type. There was no consistent relationship between the degree of depression of the paraesthesiae and the presence of peripheral neuropathy.

In healthy men the triglyceride content was 1.77 +/- 1.30 mg/g of wet weight and in women 1.25 +/- 0.48 mg/g wet weight. The corresponding values for cholesterol were 1.07 +/- 0.24 mg/g and 1.21 +/- 0.22 mg/g and those for phospholipids 17.70 +/- 5.15 mg/g and 19.65 +/- 10.21 mg/g. The differences between the sexes were not significant. The hypertensive or cardiac hypertrophy group had about the same or slightly lower means for lipid content. In the cholelithiasis group, women had significantly high triglyceride values (3.38 +/- 2.36 mg/g). The cholesterol values were not significantly elevated in either men or women. In the diabetic group, triglycerides were significantly increased both in men (mean 8.12 +/- 0.54 mg/g) and in women (6.85 +/- 5.66 mg/g). The cholesterol mean values were also high in both sexes, but the rise was not significant because of the great variation. In the coronary atheroma group, both male and female hospital cases had high triglyceride contents (mean 4.48 +/- 4.25 mg/g and 3.65 +/- 3.94 mg/g) whereas the forensic cases had only slightly elevated or normal values. Cholesterol assays paralleled the triglyceride ones, but phospholipids showed an inverse trend. The results showed that the lipid content of papillary muscle was increased in diseases where disturbances of lipid metabolism are evident, as in diabetes and cholelithiasis. In coronary atheroma only those cases with advanced obstruction of the arteries were associated with abnormal values of papillary lipids. No increase of the lipid content with age alone was found, nor was there any correlation with obesity.</AbstractText>"}

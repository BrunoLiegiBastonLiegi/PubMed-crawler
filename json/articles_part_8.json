In insects and vertebrates, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) regenerate the GI epithelium. ISC function is regulated by intrinsic, local, and systemic stimuli to adjust regeneration to tissue demands. These control mechanisms decline with age, resulting in significant perturbation of intestinal homeostasis. Processes that lead to this decline have been explored intensively in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> in recent years and are now starting to be characterized in mammalian models. This review presents a model for age-related regenerative decline in the fly intestine and discusses recent findings that start to establish molecular mechanisms of age-related decline of mammalian ISC function. Expected final online publication date for the <i>Annual Review of Physiology</i>, Volume 82 is February 10, 2020.

The gradual physiological decline that begins after the mature stage produces myelin dysregulation and pathological changes in peripheral nervous system, attributed to reduction in myelin proteins expression and thinner myelin sheath. Moreover in elder subjects, when nerve damage occurs, the regenerative processes are seriously compromised and neuropathic pain (NeP) is maintained. We previously demonstrated that caloric restriction (CR) in adult (4 months) nerve-lesioned mice was able to facilitate remyelination and axons regeneration, to have anti-inflammatory action and to prevent NeP chronification. Here, we show CR therapeutic potential on nerve injury-induced neuropathy in mice at the beginning of the senescence (12 months). Long lasting decrease in hypersensitvity induced by peripheral nerve lesion and powerful reduction in proinflammatory circulating agents have been observed. Moreover, our results evidence that CR is able to counteract the ageing-related delay in axonal regeneration, enhancing Schwann cells proliferation and accelerating recovery processes. Differently from adults, it does not affect fibres myelination. In light of a continuous growth in elderly population and correlated health problems, including metabolic disorders, the prevalence of neuropathy is enhancing, generating a significant public cost and social concern. In this context energy depletion by dietary restriction can be a therapeutic option in NeP.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It also increases bone volume by promoting osteoblast differentiation and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis in mice. However, Btz has severe systemic adverse effects, which would limit its use as a bone anabolic agent. Here, we designed and synthesized a bone-targeted form of Btz by conjugating it to a bisphosphonate (BP) with no antiresorptive activity. We report that BP-Btz inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption and stimulated osteoblast differentiation in vitro similar to Btz. In vivo, BP-Btz increased bone volume more effectively than Btz in three mouse models: untreated wild-type mice, mice with ovariectomy, and aged mice with tibial factures. Importantly, BP-Btz had significantly less systemic side effects than Btz, including less thymic cell death, sympathetic nerve damage, and thrombocytopenia, and it improved survival rates in aged mice. Thus, BP-Btz represents a novel anabolic agent to treat conditions, such as postmenopausal and age-related bone loss.

Widespread aggregation of the α-synuclein protein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine neurons are the pathological hallmarks of PD. Inflammatory responses manifested by glial reactions, T cell infiltration, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, as well as other toxic mediators derived from activated glial cells, are currently recognized as prominent features of PD. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological data suggest that intestinal inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD, and the increasing number of studies suggests that the condition may start in the gastrointestinal system years before any motor symptoms develop. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher risk of developing PD compared with non-IBD individuals. Gene association study has found a genetic link between IBD and PD, and an evidence from animal studies suggests that gut inflammation, similar to that observed in IBD, may induce loss of dopaminergic neurons. Based on preclinical models of PD, it is suggested that the enteric microbiome changes early in PD, and gut infections trigger α-synuclein release and aggregation. In this paper, the possible link between IBD and PD is reviewed based on the available literature. Given the potentially critical role of gastrointestinal pathology in PD pathogenesis, there is reason to suspect that IBD or its treatments may impact PD risk. Thus, clinicians should be aware of PD symptoms in IBD patients.</AbstractText>"}

We developed a dual fluorescence labeling system to study the exact subcellular location of γ-secretase cleavage of AβPP. The C-terminal tail of AβPP was fluorescently labeled using a SNAP-tag, while the Aβ region of AβPP was fluorescently tagged with a dye at a genetically-encoded noncanonical amino acid (ncAA). The ncAA was introduced at specific positions in AβPP using a genetic code expansion strategy and afterwards, the reactive side-chain of the ncAA was coupled to the dye using a bioorthogonal labeling chemistry. In proof-of-concept experiments, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids containing engineered AβPP harboring an amber mutation and an amber codon suppression system with an evolved tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair and grown in the presence of a lysine-derived ncAA. Processing of the AβPP variants was validated with ELISA and immunoblotting, and seven AβPP mutants that showed similar cleavage pattern as wild-type AβPP were identified. The AβPP mutant was fluorescently labeled with 6-methyl-tetrazine-BDP-FL and TMR-Star at the ncAA and SNAP-tag, respectively. Using this approach, AβPP was fluorescently labeled at two sites in living cells with minimal background to allow monitoring of Aβ and C-terminal cleavage products simultaneously. The method described provides a powerful tool to label Aβ with minimal perturbations of its processing, thus enabling studies of the trafficking of the cleavage products of AβPP.</AbstractText>"}

We aimed to develop a risk model for interval breast cancer. We conducted a nested case-control study within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study involving 168 interval breast cancer patients and 498 matched control subjects. We measured breast density using the CUMULUS software. We recorded first-degree family history by questionnaire, measured body mass index (BMI) and calculated age-adjusted breast tissue aging, a novel measure of exposure to estrogen and progesterone based on the Pike model. We fitted conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratio (OR) or odds ratio per adjusted standard deviation (OPERA) and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The stronger risk associations were for unadjusted percent breast density (OPERA = 1.99; AUC = 0.66), more so after adjusting for age and BMI (OPERA = 2.26; AUC = 0.70), and for family history (OR = 2.70; AUC = 0.56). When the latter two factors and their multiplicative interactions with age-adjusted breast tissue aging (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) were fitted, the AUC was 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.77), equivalent to a ninefold interquartile risk ratio. In summary, compared with using dense breasts alone, risk discrimination for interval breast cancers could be doubled by instead using breast density, BMI, family history and hormonal exposure.

In this form of patterning, neurons of distinct types localize their cell bodies to just one or a few of the layers within a structure. However, little is known about whether diverse neuron types within a lamina share molecular features that coordinate their organization. To begin to identify such candidates, we used the laminated murine retina to screen 92 lacZ reporter lines available through the Knockout Mouse Project. Thirty-two of these displayed reporter expression in restricted subsets of inner retina neurons. We then identified the spatiotemporal expression patterns of these genes at key developmental stages. This uncovered several that were heavily enriched in development but reduced in adulthood, including the transcriptional regulator Hmga1. An additional set of genes displayed maturation associated laminar enrichment. Among these, we identified Bbox1 as a novel gene that specifically labels all neurons in the ganglion cell layer but is largely excluded from otherwise molecularly similar neurons in the inner retina. Finally, we established Dbn1 as a new marker enriched in amacrines and Fmnl3 as a marker for subsets of αRGCs. Together, these data provide a spatiotemporal map for laminae-specific molecules and suggest that diverse neuron types within a lamina share coordinating molecular features that may inform their fate or function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study compares gravity flow test measurements taken with two 10-ml syringes of starch and gum-thickened samples prepared to a mildly thick consistency using product label information. One of the 10-ml syringes met IDDSI specification and the other 10-ml syringe did not. Thickened samples also were measured using the line spread apparatus. The results showed that two syringes yielded significantly different gravity flow test measurements, often resulting in changes to the classification level of thickness. There was no effect of thickening agent. Line spread measurements did not vary from one another. Study findings indicate the importance of continued testing with the IDDSI Flow Test and education/awareness about the use of the IDDSI reference syringe. An essential aspect about the use of thickened liquids in dysphagia management is that beverage preparations represent their prescribed level of modification. The findings of this study indicate the importance of following syringe specifications when conducting gravity flow testing using the IDDSI methodology. The implication is that the wrong 10-ml syringe could result in errant clinical decisions in determining the accuracy of texture modifications, resulting in care providers who are more likely to over or under thicken modifications to achieve a targeted level of thickness.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Thus, it is necessary to fully understand which are the major carrier losses and, thereafter, how they can be minimized. Transient Photovoltage (TPV) has been widely used to study carrier recombination in solar cells under operando conditions. Interestingly, a novel negative transient deflection appears in perovskite solar cells when carrying out TPV measurements and it has been related to the ionic accumulation at the perovskite interfaces, which is a process that requires great attention to fully understand how perovskite solar cells work. Herein, we moved one step further and continuously monitored the evolution of the negative trace with the aging of the perovskite solar cell. Importantly, we demonstrated that the negative signal changes with aging of the solar cells and such a change can be directly related to the enhancement of the open circuit voltage and fill factor of the devices and thus the solar cell efficiency. We postulate that this increase in efficiency is due to better/faster ion redistribution within the perovskite material.</AbstractText>"}

This process is mainly driven by muscle stem cells, also termed satellite cells. Satellite cells are characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Pax7 and their location underneath the basal lamina in the resting skeletal muscle. Upon injury, satellite cells get activated, undergo self-renewal or differentiation to either form new myofibers or to fuse with damaged ones. The functionality of satellite cells in vivo can be investigated using a cardiotoxin based injury model of skeletal muscle. To study the function of one gene during the regeneration of skeletal muscle, transgenic mouse models are mostly used. Here, we present an alternative method to transgenic mice, to investigate the gene function in satellite cells during regeneration, e.g., in cases where transgenic mice are not available. We combine the cardiotoxin mediated injury of a specific skeletal muscle with the injection of a self-delivering siRNA into the regenerating muscle which is then taken up by satellite cells among other cells. Thereby, we provide a method to analyze gene function in satellite cells during regeneration under physiological conditions without the need for transgenic mice.</AbstractText>"}

Because of the heterogeneity of frailty in clinical presentation, it is important to have effective strategies for the delivery of care that range across the continuum of frailty severity. In clinical practice, we should do what works, starting with frailty screening, case identification, and management of frailty. This process is unarguably difficult given the absence of an adequate evidence base for individual and health-system interventions to manage frailty. We advocate change towards individually tailored interventions that preserve an individual's independence, physical function, and cognition. This change can be addressed by promoting the recognition of frailty, furthering advancements in evidence-based treatment options, and identifying cost-effective care delivery strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevalence of frailty is expected to rise alongside rapid growth in the ageing population. The course of frailty is characterised by a decline in functioning across multiple physiological systems, accompanied by an increased vulnerability to stressors. Having frailty places a person at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including falls, hospitalisation, and mortality. Studies have shown a clear pattern of increased health-care costs and use associated with frailty. All older adults are at risk of developing frailty, although risk levels are substantially higher among those with comorbidities, low socioeconomic position, poor diet, and sedentary lifestyles. Lifestyle and clinical risk factors are potentially modifiable by specific interventions and preventive actions. The concept of frailty is increasingly being used in primary, acute, and specialist care. However, despite efforts over the past three decades, agreement on a standard instrument to identify frailty has not yet been achieved. In this Series paper, we provide an overview of the global impact and burden of frailty, the usefulness of the frailty concept in clinical practice, potential targets for frailty prevention, and directions that need to be explored in the future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The etiology of AD is complex and has not been completely elucidated.

Regarding the molecular mechanism(s), the upregulation of Aβ levels was related to increased proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Furthermore, nesting tests demonstrated that the ELP-treated animals showed significant neurobehavioral deficits with cognitive impairment.

CRMs provoke the deacetylation of cellular proteins coupled to an increase in autophagic flux in the absence of toxicity. Here, we report the identification of a novel candidate CRM, namely 3,4-dimethoxychalcone (3,4-DC), among a library of polyphenols. When added to several different human cell lines, 3,4-DC induced the deacetylation of cytoplasmic proteins and stimulated autophagic flux. At difference with other well-characterized CRMs, 3,4-DC, however, required transcription factor EB (TFEB)- and E3 (TFE3)-dependent gene transcription and mRNA translation to trigger autophagy. 3,4-DC stimulated the translocation of TFEB and TFE3 into nuclei both in vitro and in vivo, in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes. 3,4-DC induced autophagy in vitro and in mouse organs, mediated autophagy-dependent cardioprotective effects, and improved the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapy in vivo.

Therefore, we investigated the extent to which activity in the electrodermal response system triggered by the delivery of interoceptive stimuli is better predicted by perceived intensity rather than physical input. For this purpose, we reanalyzed data from the baseline phase of a previous study (n = 60) in which skin conductance responses (SCRs) to innocuous esophageal stimulations of high and low intensities were recorded in addition to categorizations based on their perceived intensity (high or low). Using both peak scoring and model inversion methods, we found that the inclusion of stimulus perception as a predictor of the magnitude of the SCR increased model fit.

Dendritic spines and synapse numbers in hippocampal neurons of female rats cyclically fluctuate across the estrous cycle, but the key genes responsible for these fluctuations are still unknown. In order to address this question, we explore the hippocampal transcriptome via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) at the proestrus (<b>PE</b>) and estrus (<b>ES</b>) stages in female rats. At standard fold-change selection criteria, 37 differentially expressed genes (<b>DEGs</b>) were found in PE vs. ES groups (FDR adjusted <i>p</i>-value (q)&lt;0.05). The transcriptional changes identified by RNA-seq were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. To gain insight into the function of the DEGs, the E2-regulated genes were annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG). Based on GO and KEGG pathways, the identified DEGs of PE vs. ES stages are involved in extracellular matrix formation, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, oxidative stress, neuroprotection, immune system, oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, signal transduction pathways, growth factor signaling, retinoid signaling, aging, cellular process, metabolism and transport. The profiles of the gene expression in the hippocampus identified at the PE vs. ES stages were compared with the gene expression profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats receiving E2 replacement via RNA-seq and qPCR. The profiles of gene expression between the OVX+E2 and the estrous cycle were different and the possible causes were discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Diet adherence scores for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Alternate Mediterranean (AMED) diets and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) were calculated using validated food-frequency questionnaires. Baseline and 3-year follow-up hearing sensitivities were assessed by pure-tone audiometry at 19 sites across the United States. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models examined independent associations between diet adherence scores and risk of low-frequency pure-tone average (PTA0.5,1,2 kHz), mid-frequency pure-tone average (PTA3,4 kHz), and high-frequency pure-tone average (PTA6,8 kHz) hearing threshold decline. Higher adherence scores were associated with lower risk of hearing loss. Compared with the lowest quintile of DASH score, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (MVORs) for mid-frequency and high-frequency decline in the highest quintile were 0.71 (95% CI:0.55,0.92; P-trend=0.003) and 0.75 (95% CI:0.59,0.96; P-trend=0.02).

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by oral microbial dysbiosis, and dysregulation of dendritic cell (DC) and T cell responses. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which the oral microbe <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) manipulates dendritic cell signaling to perturb both autophagy and apoptosis. Using a combination of Western blotting, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis, we show a pivotal role for the minor (Mfa1) fimbriae of <i>P. gingivalis</i> in nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Akt and FOXO1 in human monocyte-derived DCs. Mfa1-induced Akt nuclear localization and activation ultimately induced mTOR. Activation of the Akt/mTOR axis downregulated intracellular LC3II, also known as Atg8, required for autophagosome formation and maturation. Use of allosteric panAkt inhibitor MK2206 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin confirmed the role of Akt/mTOR signaling in autophagy inhibition by <i>P. gingivalis</i> in DCs. Interestingly, this pathway was also linked to induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, decreased caspase-3 cleavage and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bim, thus promoting longevity of host DCs. Addition of ABT-199 peptide to disrupt the interaction of antiapoptotic Bcl2 and its proapoptotic partners BAK/BAX restored apoptotic death to <i>P. gingivalis-</i>infected DC cells.

A Review of Potential Options for Therapeutic Intervention.","Journal":"Frontiers in immunology","Date":"2019","Keywords":"aging, immunomodulation, immunosenescence, immunotherapy, nutrition","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Aging is accompanied by remodeling of the immune system. With time, this leads to a decline in immune efficacy, resulting in increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, diminished responses to vaccination, and a susceptibility to age-related inflammatory diseases. An age-associated immune alteration, extensively reported in previous studies, is the reduction in the number of peripheral blood naïve cells, with a relative increase in the frequency of memory cells. These two alterations, together with inflamm-aging, are considered the hallmarks of immunosenescence. Because aging is a plastic process, it is influenced by both nutritional and pharmacological interventions. Therefore, the role of nutrition and of immunomodulation in immunosenescence is discussed, due to the multifactorial influence on these hallmarks. The close connection between nutrition, intake of bioactive nutrients and supplements, immune function, and inflammation demonstrate the key role of dietary strategies as regulators of immune response and inflammatory status, hence as possible modulators of the rate of immunosenescence. In addition, potential options for therapeutic intervention are clarified. In particular, the use of interleukin-7 as growth factor for naïve T cells, the function of checkpoint inhibitors in improving T cell responses during aging and, the potential of drugs that inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinases and their interaction with nutrient signaling pathways are discussed. Finally, it is suggested that the inclusion of appropriate combinations of toll-like receptor agonists may enhance the efficacy of vaccination in older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Aiello, Farzaneh, Candore, Caruso, Davinelli, Gambino, Ligotti, Zareian and Accardi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recent work has reported that depressive symptoms were associated with lower metacognitive bias (overall confidence) during perceptual decision making and a trend toward a positive association with metacognitive sensitivity (the ability to discriminate correct and incorrect decisions). Here, we extended this work, investigating whether confidence judgments are more malleable in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that depressive symptoms would be associated with greater adjustment of confidence in light of new evidence presented after a perceptual decision had been made. <b>Methods:</b> Participants (N = 416) were recruited <i>via</i> Amazon Mechanical Turk. Metacognitive confidence was assessed through two perceptual decision-making tasks. In both tasks, participants made a decision about which of two squares contained more dots. In the first task, participants rated their confidence immediately following the decision, whereas in the second task, participants observed new evidence (always in the same direction as initial evidence) before rating their confidence. Participants also completed questionnaires measuring depressive symptoms and self-esteem. <b>Analysis:</b> Metacognitive bias was calculated as overall mean confidence, whereas metacognitive sensitivity was calculated using meta-d' (a response-bias free measure of how closely confidence tracks task performance) in the first task. Postdecision evidence integration (PDEI) was defined as the change in confidence following postdecision evidence on the second task. <b>Results:</b> Participants with more depressive symptoms made greater confidence adjustments (i.e., greater PDEI) in light of new evidence (β = 0.119, p = 0.045), confirming our main hypothesis. We also observed that lower overall confidence was associated with greater depressive symptoms, although this narrowly missed statistical significance (β = -0.099, p = 0.056), and we did not find an association between metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d') and depressive symptoms. Notably, self-esteem was robustly associated with overall confidence (β = 0.203, p &lt; 0.001), which remained significant when controlling for depressive symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found that individuals with depressive symptoms were more influenced by postdecisional evidence, adjusting their confidence more in light of new evidence.

Although emerging studies suggest that ASD is associated with premature ageing and various medical comorbidities, as described for ID, data are scarce. <b>Objectives:</b> To determine the comorbidity burden and its association with distinct clinical presentation in terms of ASD severity, adaptive skills, level of autonomy, and drug exposure in a well-phenotyped sample of individuals with ASD-ID-the EFAAR (Frailty Assessment in Ageing Adults with Autism Spectrum and Intellectual Disabilities) cohort. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 63 adults with ASD-ID, with a mean age of 42.9 ± 15.1 years, were recruited from 2015 to 2017 from nine specialized institutions. They underwent detailed clinical examinations, including screening for comorbidities, ASD severity [Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], adaptive functioning [Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (VABS-II)], autonomy [activities of daily living (ADLs)], and drug use [polypharmacy and the Drug Burden Index (DBI)]. The comorbidity burden was evaluated using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) and its sub-scores [the severity index (CIRS-SI) and severe comorbidity (CIRS-SC)]. <b>Results:</b> We found a large range of comorbidities, including gastrointestinal disorders and mental and neurological diseases. Overall, 25% of our ASD-ID sample had chronic kidney disease with the associated increased cardiovascular risk factors. The comorbidity burden was high (mean CIRS-G total score of 10.6 ± 4.8), comparable with that observed among patients older than those in our population hospitalized in geriatric departments. Furthermore, the comorbidity burden positively correlated with age, decreased autonomy, and polypharmacy. <b>Conclusion:</b> The severity of the comorbidity burden associated with premature ageing in adults with ASD and ID highlight their crucial need of personalized medical care.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Miot, Akbaraly, Michelon, Couderc, Crepiat, Loubersac, Picot, Pernon, Gonnier, Jeandel, Blain and Baghdadli.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Since the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and of mitochondria in MH crisis has been previously debated, here we sought to determine Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in mitochondria and its possible link with ROS production in single fibers isolated from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) of YS mice. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, as detected with the ratiometric FRET-based 4mtD3cpv probe, was higher in YS than in wild-type (WT) fibers at rest and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from SR during repetitive electrical stimulation or caffeine administration. Also mitochondrial ROS production associated with contractile activity (detected with Mitosox probe) was much higher in YS fibers than in WT. Importantly, the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake achieved by silencing MCU reduced ROS accumulation in the matrix and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from SR. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS accumulation using Mitotempo reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in YS fibers exposed to caffeine. The present results support the view that mitochondria take up larger amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in YS than in WT fibers and that mitochondrial ROS production substantially contributes to the increased caffeine-sensitivity and to the enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from SR in YS fibers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Canato, Capitanio, Cancellara, Leanza, Raffaello, Vecellio Reane, Marcucci, Michelucci, Protasi and Reggiani.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that atypical antipsychotics were associated with a significantly greater mortality risk compared to placebo, which prompted the addition of an FDA black-box warning. The American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) White Paper, 2008, reviewed this issue and made clinical and research recommendations regarding the use of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and/or agitation. Increased mortality risk has also been described in cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly users of antipsychotics. In the present work, at the translational level, we used male 3xTg-AD mice (PS1M146V, APPSwe, tauP301L) at advanced stages of the disease reported to have worse survival than females, to study the behavioral effects of a low chronic dose of risperidone (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., 90 days, from 13 to 16 months of age) and its impact on long-term survival, as compared to mice with normal aging. Animals were behaviorally assessed for cognitive and BPSD (behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia)-like symptoms in naturalistic and experimental conditions (open-field test, T-maze, social interaction, Morris water maze, and marble test) before and after treatment. Weight, basal glucose levels, and IPGTT (i.p. glucose tolerance test) were also recorded. Neophobia in the corner test was used for behavioral monitoring. Survival curves were recorded throughout the experiment until natural death. The benefits of risperidone were limited, both at cognitive and BPSD-like level, and mostly restricted to burying, agitation/vibrating tail, and other social behaviors. However, the work warns about a clear early mortality risk window during the treatment and long-lasting impact on survival. Reduced life expectancy and life span were observed in the 3xTg-AD mice, but total lifespan (36 months) recorded in C57BL/6 × 129Sv counterparts with normal aging was also truncated to 28 months in those with treatment. Sarcopenia at time of death was found in all groups, but was more severe in wild-type animals treated with risperidone. Therefore, the 3xTg-AD mice and their non-transgenic counterparts can be useful to delimitate critical time windows and for studying the physio-pathogenic factors and underlying causal events involved in this topic of considerable public health significance.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Torres-Lista, López-Pousa and Giménez-Llort.</CopyrightInformation>"}

If sustained, neuroinflammation is a common denominator of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major depression, and of aging. Hence, limiting neuroinflammation is a real strategy for neuroinflammatory disease therapy and treatment. Recent data show that n-3 LC-PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties in part through the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) such as resolvins, maresins and protectins. These SPMs are crucially involved in the resolution of inflammation. They could be good candidates to resolve brain inflammation and to contribute to neuroprotective functions and could lead to novel therapeutics for brain inflammatory diseases. This review presents an overview 1) of brain n-3 LC-PUFAs as precursors of SPMs with an emphasis on the effect of n-3 PUFAs on neuroinflammation, 2) of the formation and action of SPMs in the brain and their biological roles, and the possible regulation of their synthesis by environmental factors such as inflammation and nutrition and, in particular, PUFA consumption.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Joffre, Rey and Layé.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is highly applicable to gait rehabilitation for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) because feedback potentially engages spared neural function. Our study characterizes participants' motor adaptation to feedback signaling a deviation from their normal cadence during prolonged walking, providing insight into possible novel therapeutic devices for gait re-training. Twenty-eight persons with PD (15 with freezing, 13 without) and 13 age-matched healthy elderly (HE) walked for two 30-minute sessions. When their cadence varied, they heard either intelligent cueing (IntCue: bouts of ten beats indicating normal cadence) or intelligent feedback (IntFB: verbal instruction to increase or decrease cadence). We created a model that compares the effectiveness of the two conditions by quantifying the number of steps needed to return to the target cadence for every deviation. The model fits the short-term motor responses to the external step inputs (collected with wearable sensors). We found some significant difference in motor adaptation among groups and subgroups for the IntCue condition only. Both conditions were instead able to identify different types of responders among persons with PD, although showing opposite trends in their speed of adaptation. Increasing rather than decreasing the pace appeared to be more difficult for both groups. In fact, under IntFB the PD group required about seven steps to increase their cadence, whereas they only needed about three steps to decrease their cadence. However, it is important to note that this difference was not significant; perhaps future work could include more participants and/or more sessions, increasing the total number of deviations for analysis. Notably, a significant negative correlation, <i>r</i> = -0.57 (<i>p</i>-value = 0.008), was found between speed of adaptation and number of deviations during IntCue, but not during IntFB, suggesting that, for people who struggle with gait, such as those with PD, verbal instructions rather than metronome beats might be more effective at restoring normal cadence. Clinicians and biofeedback developers designing novel therapeutic devices could apply our findings to determine the optimal timing for corrective feedback, optimizing gait rehabilitation while minimizing the risk of cue-dependency.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Corzani, Ferrari, Ginis, Nieuwboer and Chiari.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Targeting this proteolytic pathway effectively reduces/prevents pathology and cognitive decline in preclinical experimental models of the disease, but therapeutic strategies based on secretase activity modifying drugs have so far failed in clinical trials. Although this may raise some doubts on the relevance of β- and γ-secretases as targets, new APP-cleaving enzymes, including meprin-β, legumain (δ-secretase), rhomboid-like protein-4 (RHBDL4), caspases and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs/η-secretases) have confirmed that APP processing remains a solid mechanism in AD pathophysiology. This review will discuss recent findings on the roles of all these proteinases in the nervous system, and in particular on the roles of MT-MMPs, which are at the crossroads of pathological events involving not only amyloidogenesis, but also inflammation and synaptic dysfunctions.

Although the link between altered neuronal signaling and age-related cognitive impairments is not completely understood, it is evident that declining cognitive abilities are at least partially due to synaptic dysfunction. Aging is accompanied by well-documented changes in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling across species. Age-related synaptic alterations are not uniform across the brain, however, with different regions showing unique patterns of vulnerability in advanced age. In the hippocampus, increased activity within the CA3 subregion has been observed across species, and this can be reversed with anti-epileptic medication. In contrast to CA3, the dentate gyrus shows reduced activity with age and declining metabolic activity. Ketogenic diets have been shown to decrease seizure incidence and severity in epilepsy, improve metabolic function in diabetes type II, and improve cognitive function in aged rats. This link between neuronal activity and metabolism suggests that metabolic interventions may be able to ameliorate synaptic signaling deficits accompanying advanced age. We therefore investigated the ability of a dietary regimen capable of inducing nutritional ketosis and improving cognition to alter synapse-related gene expression across the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Following 12 weeks of a ketogenic or calorie-matched standard diet, RTq-PCR was used to quantify expression levels of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling genes within CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus. While there were no age or diet-related changes in CA1 gene expression, expression levels were significantly altered within CA3 by age and within the dentate gyrus by diet for several genes involved in presynaptic glutamate regulation and postsynaptic excitation and plasticity. These data demonstrate subregion-specific alterations in synaptic signaling with age and the potential for a ketogenic diet to alter these processes in dissociable ways across different brain structures that are uniquely vulnerable in older animals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Hernandez, Hernandez, Truckenbrod, Campos, McQuail, Bizon and Burke.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is recognized that a number of environmental factors such as environmental quality (air, water, soil), or environmental changes contribute to the occurrence of certain cancers. Despite this awareness, their potential impacts on health raise many scientific questions. The development of new methodological tools for the characterization of exposure, the study of the association between environmental agents and cancer through an exposure-cancer approach and the health impacts associated, have led to changes in scientific paradigms including the concept of exposome. This concept, at the heart of health and environmental issues, takes into account the determinants of health related to the quality of populations' living environments and provides assistance in public policy decision-making. Ultimately, the aim is to develop measures likely to reduce exposure and prevent health risks and damage to the most vulnerable populations, both in their physical environment and in their living environment, including the economic and social determinants.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Clinical findings have suggested that physical exercise can promote brain plasticity, particularly the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, that are important for learning and memory and mood regulations. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Animal studies reveal that the effects of physical exercise on promoting neuroplasticity could be mediated by different exerkines derived from the peripheral system and the brain itself.

This phenomenon stimulates structural, molecular, and genetic changes in the brain and is the leading biological model for learning and memory processes. Synapses are able to show persistent increases in synaptic strength, or long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as persistent decreases in synaptic strength, known as long-term depression (LTD). Understanding the complex interactions that regulate these activity-dependent processes can provide insight for the development of strategies to improve cognitive function. Twenty years ago, we provided the first evidence indicating that aerobic exercise can reliably enhance LTP, and went on to show that it can also regulate some of the mechanisms involved in LTD induction. Since then, several laboratories have confirmed and expanded these findings, helping to identify different molecular mechanisms involved in exercise-mediated changes in synaptic efficacy. This chapter reviews this material and shows how these experimental findings may prove valuable for alleviating the burden of neurodegenerative diseases in an aging population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Detailed knowledge of the pattern of sexual dimorphism of the human calcaneus could help to clarify the pathogenetic mechanism of foot and knee disorders, which are more prevalent in females. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize and visualize the three-dimensional shape variations of the calcaneus in relation to sex and age using geometric morphometrics. Computed tomography images of 56 feet without subtalar injuries or disorders were used in this study. Thirty-seven anatomical landmarks were identified on the bone model of the calcaneus to calculate principal components (PCs) of shape variations among specimens. The PC scores were compared between males and females, and their correlations with age were also analyzed. The female calcaneus was longer in length and shorter in height than that of males. The medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity in females was more inferiorly projected and the tuberosity was shifted more laterally. Also, the calcaneus was wider and the sustentaculum tali thickened with aging. Female structural features of the calcaneus alter the kinematics of the foot during walking and could be a structural factor in foot and knee disorders. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of shape variations in the human calcaneus. Clin.

However, clinical trials focused on the Aβ pathway failed in their attempt to modify disease progression, suggesting the existence of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation is a feature of cerebral aging, with an increased frequency and anticipated age of onset in several forms of neurodegeneration, including AD.

However, until now, it has remained unknown whether specific inflammation- or senescence-related genes exist that are common between different species or tissues. These potential markers of aging could help to identify possible targets for therapeutic interventions of aging-associated afflictions and might also deepen our understanding of the principal mechanisms of aging. With the objective of identifying such signatures of aging and tissue-specific aging markers, we analyzed a multitude of cross-sectional RNA-Seq data from four evolutionarily distinct species (human, mouse and two fish) and four different tissues (blood, brain, liver and skin). In at least three different species and three different tissues, we identified several genes that displayed similar expression patterns that might serve as potential aging markers. Additionally, we show that genes involved in aging-related processes tend to be tighter controlled in long-lived than in average-lived individuals. These observations hint at a general genetic level that affect an individual's life span. Altogether, this descriptive study contributes to a better understanding of common aging signatures as well as tissue-specific aging patterns and supplies the basis for further investigative age-related studies.</AbstractText>"}

Knockdown of receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase (RIPK) 1 leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. However, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathogenesis of OA is unclear. Here, we evaluated the effect of RIPK1 on chondrocytes and elaborated the underlying molecular mechanism. Knockdown of RIPK1 protected chondrocytes against inflammation and apoptosis induced by interleukin (IL)-1β <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. RIPK1 was required for myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)- and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon b (TRIF)-mediated production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in OA. Moreover, overexpression of RIPK1 promoted the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which blocked the expression and phosphorylation of RIPK1. Upregulation of TRAF2 decreased the expression of TRIF, MyD88, and MMPs in chondrocytes. Furthermore, knockdown of RIPK1 blocked activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. In summary, knockdown of RIPK1 alleviated OA in a manner mediated by the TRIF/MyD88-RIPK1-TRAF2 negative feedback loop and activation of the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways.</AbstractText>"}

This study measured endogenous plasma OT and AVP levels in generally healthy young (18-31 years) and older (63-81 years) men and women to (i) determine levels of and interrelations between OT and AVP; (ii) explore functional relationships with self-reported attachment (attachment anxiety and avoidance) and performance-based cognition (processing speed, verbal memory); and (iii) identify variations in these effects by sex and age. We observed sex- and age-differential patterns of results: Women had higher plasma OT levels than men and older adults had higher plasma AVP levels than young adults. The two neuropeptides were highly negatively intercorrelated across all groups. Functionally, higher AVP levels were associated with greater attachment anxiety and higher OT and lower AVP levels were associated with faster sensorimotor processing speed, with sex and age moderating these effects.

We explored the possibility that Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a hematopoietic receptor-tyrosine kinase, is subject to this type of regulation. An underlying rationale was that the FLT3 gene is frequently mutated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients, and resulting oncogenic variants of FLT3 with 'internal tandem duplications (FLT3ITD)' drive production of reactive oxygen in leukemic cells. FLT3 was moderately activated by treatment of intact cells with hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, FLT3ITD signaling was attenuated by cell treatments with agents inhibiting formation of reactive oxygen species. FLT3 and FLT3ITD incorporated DCP-Bio1, a reagent specifically reacting with sulfenic acid residues. Mutation of FLT3ITD cysteines 695 and 790 reduced DCP-Bio1 incorporation, suggesting that these sites are subject to oxidative modification. Functional characterization of individual FLT3ITD cysteine-to-serine mutants of all 8 cytoplasmic cysteines revealed phenotypes in kinase activity, signal transduction and cell transformation.

The inability of cartilage tissue to self-repair is instrumental in developing tissue engineered substitutes. To this effect, the present study aims to engineer cartilage construct by culturing umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on novel 3D porous scaffolds developed from natural biopolymers, silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS), with addition of cartilage matrix components, glucosamine (Gl) and chondroitin sulfate (Ch). The presence of Gl and Ch is expected to enhance cartilage regeneration. The developed SF/CS-Gl-Ch scaffolds possess desired pore size in the range 56.55-168.15 μm, 88-92% porosity, 44.7-46.8̊ contact angle, controlled swelling and biodegradability. Upon culturing under dynamic condition in a spinner flask bioreactor, the scaffold supported hMSCs attachment, proliferation, and further promoted chondrogenic differentiation. Cartilage-specific matrix and gene (Collagen II, Sox9 and aggrecan) expression analyses by histology, immunophenotype, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR studies showed superiority of cell-scaffold construct generated in dynamic culture towards cartilage tissue generation as compared to cell aggregates formed by pellet culture. This study demonstrates the potentiality of SF/CS-Gl-Ch porous scaffold for the development of tissue construct for cartilage regeneration under dynamic culture condition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 International Society of Differentiation.

We previously demonstrated that hypoxic priming plays roles in lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells. In the present study, we found that hypoxia-primed embryoid bodies (Hyp-EBs) efficiently differentiate into the myogenic lineage, resulting in the induction of the myogenic marker MyoD, which was not mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) or HIF2α, but rather by Sp1 induction and binding to the MyoD promoter. Knockdown of Sp1 in Hyp-EBs abrogated hypoxia-induced MyoD expression and myogenic differentiation. Importantly, in the cardiotoxin-muscle injury mice model, Hyp-EB transplantation facilitated muscle regeneration in vivo, whereas transplantation of Sp1-knockdown Hyp-EBs failed to do. Moreover, we compared microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles between EBs under normoxia versus hypoxia and found that hypoxia-mediated Sp1 induction was mediated by the suppression of miRNA-92a, which directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of Sp1. Further, the inhibitory effect of miRNA-92a on Sp1 in luciferase assay was abolished by a point mutation in specific sequence in the Sp1 3' UTR that is required for the binding of miRNA-92a. Collectively, these results suggest that hypoxic priming enhances EB commitment to the myogenic lineage through miR-92a/Sp1/MyoD regulatory axis, suggesting a new pathway that promotes myogenic-lineage differentiation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Transcriptomes in axons and soma are distinct, but the mechanisms governing the composition of axonal transcriptomes and their developmental regulation are only partially understood. We found that the binding motif for the RNA-binding proteins Pumilio 1 and 2 (Pum1 and Pum2) is underrepresented in transcriptomes of developing axons. Introduction of Pumilio-binding elements (PBEs) into mRNAs containing a β-actin zipcode prevented axonal localization and translation. Pum2 is restricted to the soma of developing neurons, and Pum2 knockdown or blocking its binding to mRNA caused the appearance and translation of PBE-containing mRNAs in axons. Pum2-deficient neurons exhibited axonal growth and branching defects in vivo and impaired axon regeneration in vitro. These results reveal that Pum2 shapes axonal transcriptomes by preventing the transport of PBE-containing mRNAs into axons, and they identify somatic mRNAs retention as a mechanism for the temporal control of intra-axonal protein synthesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the friction sensitive nature of the material and difficulty of synthesis made routine use difficult. Many of these issues have since been addressed, making equipment and chemicals available to build an understanding of how the effectiveness of disulfur dinitride compares to other fingermark visualisation processes currently used on metal surfaces. This enables more informed advice to be given on selection of processes for treatment of metal items, an area of operational interest that encompasses weapons used in violent crime and the increasing incidence in metal theft. This paper reports a comparative study into the effectiveness of disulfur dinitride, cyanoacrylate fuming, vacuum metal deposition, gun blueing and wet powder suspensions on brass, bronze, copper and stainless steel. Experiments were conducted with the surfaces exposed to a range of environments including long term ageing, water/detergent washing, acetone washing and high temperature exposure. The results indicate that disulfur dinitride is an effective process for fingermark visualisation on metal surfaces, including those exposed to adverse environments, and may offer potential improvements over existing processes for those surfaces.

Clonal expansion of rediae within the snail correlates with increased expression of genes associated with transcription, translation and repair. All intra-snail stages (miracidia, rediae and cercariae) require abundant cathepsin L peptidases for migration and feeding and, as indicated by their annotation, express genes putatively involved in the manipulation of snail innate immune responses. Cercariae emerge from the snail, settle on vegetation and become encysted metacercariae that are infectious to mammals; these remain metabolically active, transcribing genes involved in regulation of metabolism, synthesis of nucleotides, pH and endopeptidase activity to assure their longevity and survival on pasture. Dramatic growth and development following infection of the mammalian host are associated with high gene transcription of cell motility pathways, and transport and catabolism pathways. The intra-mammalian stages temporally regulate key families of genes including the cathepsin L and B proteases and their trans-activating peptidases, the legumains, during intense feeding and migration through the intestine, liver and bile ducts.

Previously, we demonstrated high DNA repair capacity and low DNA damage in Spalax fibroblasts following genotoxic stress compared with rats. Since the acquisition of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is a consequence of persistent DNA damage, we investigated whether cellular senescence in Spalax is accompanied by an inflammatory response. Spalax fibroblasts undergo replicative senescence (RS) and etoposide-induced senescence (EIS), evidenced by an increased activity of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), growth arrest, and overexpression of p21, p16, and p53 mRNAs. Yet, unlike mouse and human fibroblasts, RS and EIS Spalax cells showed undetectable or decreased expression of the well-known SASP factors: interleukin-6 (IL6), IL8, IL1α, growth-related oncogene alpha (GROα), SerpinB2, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1). Apparently, due to the efficient DNA repair in Spalax, senescent cells did not accumulate the DNA damage necessary for SASP activation. Conversely, Spalax can maintain DNA integrity during replicative or moderate genotoxic stress and limit pro-inflammatory secretion. However, exposure to the conditioned medium of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 resulted in an increase in DNA damage, activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through nuclear translocation, and expression of inflammatory mediators in RS Spalax cells. Evaluation of SASP in aging Spalax brain and intestine confirmed downregulation of inflammatory-related genes. These findings suggest a natural mechanism for alleviating the inflammatory response during cellular senescence and aging in Spalax, which can prevent age-related chronic inflammation supporting healthy aging and longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, new and exciting evidence suggests that neurons can survive for longer than previously thought, highlighting an unexpected resilience and underappreciated capacity for functional recovery that has changed the way we think about brain cell death. Nature has the potential to unlock some of the mysteries underlying ischaemic survival, with select vertebrates having solved the problem of anoxia-hypoxia tolerance over millions of years of evolution.

AVP(4-8), different from its precursor AVP, plays memory enhancement roles in the CNS without peripheral side-effects. However, it is not clear whether AVP(4-8) can improve cognitive behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Here, we investigated for the first time the neuroprotective effects of AVP(4-8) on memory behaviors and in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in APP/PS1-AD mice. The results showed that: (1) APP/PS1-AD mice had lower spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze than wild-type (WT) mice, and this was significantly reversed by AVP(4-8); (2) the prolonged escape latency of APP/PS1-AD mice in the Morris water maze was significantly decreased by AVP(4-8), and the decreased swimming time in target quadrant recovered significantly after AVP(4-8) treatment; (3) in vivo hippocampal LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation had a significant deficit in the AD mice, and this was partly rescued by AVP(4-8); (4) AVP(4-8) significantly up-regulated the expression levels of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus of AD mice. These results reveal the beneficial effects of AVP(4-8) in APP/PS1-AD mice, showing that the intranasal administration of AVP(4-8) effectively improved the working memory and long-term spatial memory of APP/PS1-AD mice, which may be associated with the elevation of PSD95 and NGF levels in the brain and the maintenance of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</AbstractText>"}

We tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) contributes to CHF progression. A total of 31 patients who had a history of hospital admission due to worsening HF were enrolled and grouped as having either mild CHF defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I-II or moderate-to-severe CHF defined as NYHA functional class III. ROS levels in PBMC mitochondria were significantly increased in CHF patients with NYHA functional class III compared to those with NYHA functional class I-II, accompanied by impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity in PBMCs. ROS generation in PBMC mitochondria was positively correlated with urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, a systemic oxidative stress marker, in CHF patients. Importantly, mitochondrial ROS generation in PBMCs was directly correlated with plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, a biomarker for severity of HF, and inversely correlated with peak oxygen uptake, a parameter of exercise capacity, in CHF patients. The study showed that ROS generation in PBMC mitochondria was higher in patients with advanced CHF, and it was associated with disease severity and exercise intolerance in CHF patients.</AbstractText>"}

We find that choices of normalisation and library preparation protocols have the biggest impact on scRNA-seq analyses. Specifically, we find that library preparation determines the ability to detect symmetric expression differences, while normalisation dominates pipeline performance in asymmetric DE-setups.

In this study, we performed virtual screening, identified the synthetic disaccharide 6'-sialylgalactose (6SG) as a potent VEGFR-2-binding compound and verified its high binding affinity by Biacore assay. 6SG effectively suppressed VEGF-A-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and subsequent in vitro angiogenesis in HUVECs without inducing cytotoxicity. 6SG also inhibited VEGF-A-induced extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)/Akt activation and actin stress fiber formation in HUVECs.

In reality, population estimates of chemosensory disorders vary widely among studies, reflecting not only differential sampling of such variables, but the types of sensory tests that have been employed and the choice of cutoff points to define abnormality. While population-based studies likely provide the most accurate assessments of overall prevalence, even their findings vary dramatically.

Given a growing body of evidence showing varying degrees of shrinkage over time with no effect on functional outcome, allograft morphologic changes may not be as clinically important as once thought from a clinical standpoint.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

The exact role of microglia in CNS disorders is not clear due to lack of tools to discriminate between microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells. Here, we present a novel reporter mouse model targeting a microglia-specific marker, TMEM119, for studying microglia in health and disease. By placing a reporter cassette (GSG-3xFlag-P2A-tdTomato) between the coding sequence of exon 2 and 3'UTR of the Tmem119 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a Tmem119-tdTomato knock-in mouse strain. Gene expression assay showed no difference of endogenous Tmem119 in the CNS of Tmem119<sup>tdTomato/+</sup> relative to wild-type mice. The cells expressing tdTomato were recognized by immunofluorescence staining using commercially available anti-TMEM119 antibodies. Additionally, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry techniques revealed that tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells are detected throughout the CNS, but not in peripheral tissues of Tmem119<sup>tdTomato/+</sup> mice. Aging does not influence TMEM119 expression as tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were detectable in the CNS of older mice (300 and 540 days old). Further immunofluorescence characterization shows that tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells colocalize with Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells in the brain, but not with neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of brain tissues of adult mice demonstrates that the majority of microglia CD45<sup>lo</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells (96.3%) are tdTomato-positive; and a minority of infiltrating CD45<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (5.3%) are also tdTomato-positive, which we further characterized and found that tdTomato expression is in part of choroid plexus macrophages but not in meningeal and perivascular macrophages. Functionally, using an acute injury model, we measured time-lapse activation of tdTomato-labeled microglia by transcranial two-photon microscopy in live Tmem119<sup>tdTomato/+</sup> mice. Taken together, the Tmem119-tdTomato reporter mouse model is a valuable tool to specifically study the role of microglia in health and disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We report that MCC950 attenuates metabolic and hepatic dysfunction in aged mice. MCC950 inhibited the Pi3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and enhanced autophagy and activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) in vivo and in vitro. The data suggest that MCC950 mediates the protective effects by mTOR inhibiton activating autophagy and PPARα.

However, the causal association of TL on physical and cognitive traits that decline with age has not been extensively examined in middle-aged adults. Using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we utilized genetically increased TL (GI-TL) to estimate the causal association of TL on aging-related traits among UK Biobank (UKB) participants (age 40-69 years). We manually curated 53 aging-related traits from the UKB and restricted to unrelated participants of British ancestry (n=337,522). We estimated GI-TL as a linear combination of nine TL-associated SNPs, each weighted by its previously-reported association with leukocyte TL. Regression models were used to assess the associations between GI-TL and each trait. We obtained MR estimates using the two-sample inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach. We identified 6 age-related traits associated with GI-TL (Bonferroni-corrected threshold p &lt; 0.001): pulse pressure (PP) (p=5.2x10-14), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p=2.9x10-15), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p=5.5x10-6), hypertension (p=5.5x10-11), forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (p=0.0001), and forced vital capacity (FVC) (p=3.8x10-6). Under MR assumptions, one standard deviation increase in TL (~1200 base pairs) increased PP, SBP, and DBP by 1.5, 2.3, and 0.8 mmHg, respectively, while FEV1 and FVC increased by 34.7 and 52.2 mL, respectively. The observed associations appear unlikely to be due to selection bias based on analyses including inverse probability weights and analyses of simulated data.

Random effects regression models for panel data were used to estimate the associations with LTL and its longitudinal changes. Sample collection procedures and DNA refrigerator storage time were strongly associated with LTL: telomeres are longer in blood collected in October-December, in DNA extracted from &lt;1-year-old blood cells, and in DNA stored at 4°C for longer periods of time up to five years. The data confirmed that telomeres are shorter at older ages, as well as among males, and diabetic individuals, whereas telomeres are longer in the high-longevity Nicoya region. Most health, biomarkers, and early childhood indicators did not show significant associations with LTL. Longitudinal LTL variation over approximately two years was mainly associated with baseline LTL levels, as found in other studies. Our findings suggest that if there is unavoidable variability in season of sample collection and DNA storage time, these factors should be controlled for in all demographic and epidemiologic studies of LTL.

The percentage of viable eggs during release was, on average, significantly lower in treated sites than in control sites, with the greatest difference (16%) seen after the fourth release. The ARwP to wild male ratio in the release spots between day 3 after the first ARwP male release and day 7 after the last release was, on average, 7:10. Released males survived up to 2 weeks. Approximately 30% of females collected in the release spots showed 100% sterility and 20% showed strongly reduced fertility compared with control sites.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Results support the potential of IIT as a tool contributing to Ae. albopictus control in the urban context, and stress the need for larger field trials to evaluate the cost-efficacy of the approach in suppressing wild populations. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this context, this article asks about the consequences of this increase in informal caregivers, emphasizing the inequity issues arising from these changes. Using the CASEN 2017 survey, caregivers are identified and matched to people with long-term care needs. Results show that most caregivers are women, and a large fraction of them are also elderly; this is similar to what has been found previously in developed countries. Caregivers have fewer opportunities than non-caregivers, which translates into lower income-generating ability and higher poverty. The nature of these tasks creates a vicious cycle in which people get trapped with increasing needs and fewer resources to meet them. Important differences arise between caregivers and the rest of the population. Even more concerning is that these disparities are avoidable to some extent, adding an equity dimension to the problem. This emphasizes the need for the generation of policies that will support caregivers and meet their needs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we reject the hypothesis that the increased abundance of the species following soil heating is caused only by reduced competition with other ectomycorrnizal fungi and show instead that heating alone significantly increases the inoculum potential of its spores. We argue that this is likely caused by heat stimulation of the spores, a process that has precedent in saprotrophic fungi and plant seeds.

Based on the structural similarity between Ge and deoxycytidine (dC), dC nucleotides in the component DNA strands used for nanogel assembly are fully replaced by Ge during their synthesis. By changing the designed sequences, two Ge-containing Y-shaped motifs with different sticky ends are first assembled and then associated together to form nanogel by sticky-end hybridizations. In particular, one of the sticky-end sequences is arbitrarily designed to be rich of Ge and the other is designed to be partially complementary to the first Ge-rich sticky end. At the neutral or basic condition, the Ge-rich sticky ends hybridize with the partially complementary sticky ends on the second Y motifs, keeping the assembled nanogel stable. Upon being exposed to the acidic condition, Ge-rich sticky ends intend to form intramolecular i-motif-like quadruplex structures, resulting in the disassembly of the nanogel. On the one hand, the nanosized feature enables the Ge-containing nanogel with rapid cellular uptake behavior. On the other hand, the pH-responsive feature endows the rapid disassembly of the nanogel to facilitate the enzymatic drug release inside the cell, resulting in the enhanced anticancer activity of the DNA-based drug delivery system.</AbstractText>"}

Cognitive reserve (CR) refers to an active process that facilitates the flexibility and efficiency of the neural networks to compensate for impairments that emerge in consequence of brain pathology. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated whether and how CR affects emotional regulation, level of depression severity and neural activity associated with affective control during emotional Stroop (eStroop) task. Altogether, 90 older people participated in this study, 50 of whom suffered from LLD. We used years of education and verbal fluency capacity as proxies for CR. Clinical participants with relatively higher CR presented with milder degrees of depression, better eStroop performance and stronger neural activity in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) involved with exercising affective control. Results of the mediation analysis indicated that both education and verbal fluency significantly mediated the association between the depression severity and MEG activity. These results suggest a negative association between CR and age-related clinical symptoms of emotional dysregulation. Our neurobehavioral findings provide supportive evidence that CR implies efficiency of top-down emotional regulation and operates as a protective factor against emotional and cognitive vulnerability in the aging brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

ED prevalence was 42.1%. Subjects with ED presented higher BMI, waist circumference, number of components of the metabolic syndrome, AMS score, insulin resistance, and a more unfavorable body composition than those without ED. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a pathological AMS score (odds ratio [OR]: 4.238, P &lt; 0.001), degree of obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg m<sup>-2</sup>, OR: 2.602, P = 0.005, compared with BMI 30-34.9 kg m<sup>-2</sup>), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (OR: 0.956, P = 0.004), and age (OR: 1.047, P = 0.016) were factors independently associated with ED.

Laughter therapy, horticultural therapy, and reminiscence therapy were associated with the greatest decreases in loneliness. <b>Discussion:</b> Results suggest that, although less common than interventions in the community, there are several effective interventions to reduce loneliness among older adults living in LTC facilities. Lack of standardized measures and high-quality studies limits comparisons between intervention types and generalizability to different populations.</AbstractText>"}

Until quite recently, WES has been out of reach for many clinicians and molecular biologists, and it still poses issues or is met with some reluctance with regards to cost versus benefit in terms of effective assay costs, hands-on laboratory work and data analysis bottlenecks. Although WES is used more than ever, it may also be argued that the usage is peaking and that new implementations, or relevance in its current state, will likely be leveling off during the following decade as the price on whole genome sequencing continues to drop. In this review, we focus on the past decade of targeted whole exome sequencing in malignant hematology.

The question of how bats live a long time has attracted considerable attention, and they have thus been related to immortal fantasy characters like Dracula in the novel by Bram Stoker. Several ecological and physiological features, such as reduction in mortality risks, delayed sexual maturation and hibernation, have been linked to bats' long lifespan. However, there is still very little information about the molecular mechanisms associated with the longevity of bats. In this regard, the present work tries to summarize current knowledge about how bats can live for so long, taking into consideration nutritional factors, oxidative metabolism, protein homeostasis, stress resistance, DNA repair, mitochondrial physiology and cancer resistance.</AbstractText>"}

As a major component detected in ADSCs secretome, platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA) has been reported mediating extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling, thus might contribute to its anti-aging effect. On the basis of establishing an experimental model that simulate actual skin aging by exposing HDFs to both intrinsic and extrinsic aging factors, we pretreated human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with ADSC-conditioned medium (ADSC-CM) before being irradiated, aiming at exploring preventive effects of ADSCs secretome against aging damages. 48 h after irradiation, we detected cellular proliferation; β-galactosidase stain; mRNA expressions of MMP-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1; and protein expressions of collagen I, collagen III, and elastin. Moreover, we detected related protein expression of PI3K/Akt signal pathway, which can be activated by PDGF-AA and was newly found to promote extracellular matrix protein synthesis. Concentration of PDGF-AA in the prepared ADSC-CM decreased over time and maintained excellent bioactivity at low temperature until the 11th week. ADSC-CM pretreatment can slightly or significantly improve cellular proliferative activity and reduce cellular senescence in irradiated HDFs. Besides, ADSC-CM pretreatment increased collagen I, collagen III, elastin, and TIMP-1 expressions but decreased MMP-1 and MMP-9 expressions both in irradiated and nonirradiated HDFs. ADSC-CM pretreatment significantly increased pAkt protein expression, and ECM protein expression greatly decreased in case of LY294002 application. The results were similar in three generations of HDFs, yet varied with different degrees. Generally, ADSC-CM we prepared demonstrates a certain degree of positive role in preventing HDFs from intrinsic and extrinsic aging damages and that PDGF-AA may contribute to making it become effective with some other components in ADSC-CM.</AbstractText>"}

First, we compared wearable-derived and self-reported sleep metrics, particularly total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE). We then identified demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with wearable-derived TST; they included age, gender, occupation and alcohol consumption. Multi-modal phenotypic data analysis showed that wearable-derived TST and SE were associated with cardiovascular disease risk markers such as body mass index and waist circumference, whereas self-reported measures were not. Using wearable-derived TST, we showed that insufficient sleep was associated with premature telomere attrition.

Remarkably, the aging process can be modulated by environmental modifications, including diet and small molecules. The natural compound nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) robustly increases lifespan in flies and mice, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we report that NDGA is an inhibitor of the epigenetic regulator p300. We find that NDGA inhibits p300 acetyltransferase activity in vitro and suppresses acetylation of a key p300 target in histones (i.e., H3K27) in cells. We use the cellular thermal shift assay to uniquely demonstrate NDGA binding to p300 in cells. Finally, in agreement with recent findings indicating that p300 is a potent blocker of autophagy, we show that NDGA treatment induces autophagy. These findings identify p300 as a target of NDGA and provide mechanistic insight into its role in longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Currently, there are no ideal means of treatment, other than medication and sports rehabilitation. The present study investigated whether electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve can activate the motor-related area of the brain. The study is based on a self-developed fully implantable nerve electrical stimulator and a self-developed multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode array. The sciatic nerves of Sprague-Dawley rats (sorted into old and young groups) were stimulated by the electrical stimulator under anesthesia, and the EEG signal was recorded simultaneously. The relationship between sciatic nerve stimulation and brain activity was analyzed. The results showed that when the sciatic nerve was stimulated by the implanted electrical stimulator, motor-related channels were activated, causing contraction of the left leg. It was found that at the frequency band of 8-16 Hz, the EEG signal in the right motor area was higher than at other frequency bands. This phenomenon was identical in both young and old rats. The results indicated that electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve can activate the motor region of the rat brain, and provided evidence that stimulation of the sciatic nerve could be a method of preventing motor cortex degeneration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © Lv et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

People with multimorbidities often have higher physical and functional decline as well as increased mortality. Despite growing evidence that integrated and collaborative care improves many undesirable outcomes of multimorbidity, the majority of health systems are based around treating individual diseases. A pattern analysis of comorbidities using network graphs and a novel use of association rules was conducted to investigate disease associations on 6101 Irish adults aged 50+. The complex network of morbidities and differences in the prevalence and interactions of these morbidities by sex was also assessed. Gender specific differences in disease prevalence was found for 22/31 medical conditions included in this study. Females had a more complex network of disease associations than males with strong associations found between arthritis, osteoporosis and thyroid issues among others. To assess the strength of these associations we provide probabilities of being diagnosed with a comorbid condition given the presence of an index morbidity for 639 pairwise combinations. This information can be used to guide clinicians in deciding which comorbidities should be incorporated into comprehensive assessments in addition to anticipating likely future morbidities and thus developing prevention strategies.</AbstractText>"}

We performed an analysis of craniofacial morphology alterations by gender and ageing stage in Korean populations. We studied 15 facial metrics using two large Korean populations (1,926 samples from the Korea Medicine Data Center cohort and 5,643 samples from the Ansan-Ansung cohort). Among the 15 metrics, 12 showed gender differences and tended to change with age. In both of the independent populations, brow ridge height, upper lip height, nasal tip height, and profile nasal length tended to increase with age, whereas outer canthal width, right palpebral fissure height, left palpebral fissure height, right upper lip thickness, left upper lip thickness, nasal tip protrusion, facial base width, and lower facial width tended to decrease. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ageing (past 40 years of age) might affect eye size, nose length, upper lip thickness, and facial width, possibly due to loss of elasticity in the face. Therefore, these facial metric changes could be applied to individual age prediction and aesthetic facial care.</AbstractText>"}

It is present in the auditory system having antiapoptotic effects. Expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins and its PAC1 receptor differs in the inner ear of PACAP-deficient (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Our aim was to elucidate the functional role of PACAP in the auditory system. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests found higher hearing thresholds in KO mice at click and low frequency burst stimuli. Hearing impairment at higher frequencies showed as reduced ABR wave amplitudes and latencies in KO animals. Increase in neuronal activity, demonstrated by c-Fos immunolabeling, was lower in KO mice after noise exposure in the ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei. Noise induced neuronal activation was similar in further relay nuclei of the auditory pathway of WT and KO mice. Based on the similar inflammatory and angiogenic protein profile data from cochlear duct lysates, neither inflammation nor disturbed angiogenesis, as potential pathological components in sensorineural hearing losses, seem to be involved in the pathomechanism of the presented functional and morphological changes in PACAP KO mice. The hearing impairment is probably concomitant with the markedly accelerated aging processes in these animals.</AbstractText>"}

To study the role of Tfr1 in hematopoiesis, we generated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specific Tfr1 knockout mice (Tfr1-CKO). We found that Tfr1-CKO mice reached full term but died within one week of birth. Further analyses revealed that Tfr1-deficient HSCs had impaired development of all hematopoietic progenitors except thrombocytes and B lymphocytes. In addition, Tfr1-deficient cells had cellular iron deficiency, which blocked the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells, attenuated the commitment of hematopoietic lineages, and reduced the regeneration potential of HSCs. Notably, hemin rescued the colony-forming capacity of Tfr1-deficient HSCs, whereas expressing a mutant Tfr1 that lack the protein's iron-transporting capacity failed to rescue hematopoiesis. These findings provide direct evidence that Tfr1 is essential for hematopoiesis through binding diferric transferrin to supply iron to cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

When exposed to various environmental conditions, PBX 9501 will degrade through different pathways. Because PBX 9501 is composed of both low molecular weight compounds (BDNPA/F, Irganox 1010, PBNA, and potential degradation products) and high molecular weight compounds (Estane® 5703), analysis is normally performed via two independent analyses.

Although dominantly inherited, pathogenic variants in POLG, TWNK and RRM2B are among the most common genetic defects of adPEO, identification of novel candidate genes and the underlying pathomechanisms remains challenging. We report the clinical, genetic and molecular investigations of a patient who presented in the seventh decade of life with PEO. Oxidative histochemistry revealed cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and occasional ragged red fibres showing subsarcolemmal mitochondrial accumulation in skeletal muscle, while molecular studies identified the presence of multiple mtDNA deletions. Negative candidate screening of known nuclear genes associated with PEO prompted diagnostic exome sequencing, leading to the prioritisation of a novel heterozygous c.547G&gt;C variant in GMPR (NM_006877.3) encoding guanosine monophosphate reductase, a cytosolic enzyme required for maintaining the cellular balance of adenine and guanine nucleotides. We show that the novel c.547G&gt;C variant causes aberrant splicing, decreased GMPR protein levels in patient skeletal muscle, proliferating and quiescent cells, and is associated with subtle changes in nucleotide homeostasis protein levels and evidence of disturbed mtDNA maintenance in skeletal muscle. Despite confirmation of GMPR deficiency, demonstrating marked defects of mtDNA replication or nucleotide homeostasis in patient cells proved challenging. Our study proposes that GMPR is the 19th locus for PEO and highlights the complexities of uncovering disease mechanisms in late-onset PEO phenotypes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

By testing mutants in suberin transport and biosynthesis, we demonstrate the importance of this biopolymer to cope with seed deterioration. Transcriptomic analysis of cog1-2D, a gain-of-function mutant with increased seed longevity, revealed the upregulation of several peroxidase genes. Reverse genetics analysing seed longevity uncovered redundancy within the seed coat peroxidase gene family; however, after controlled deterioration treatment, seeds from the prx2 prx25 double and prx2 prx25 prx71 triple mutant plants presented lower germination than wild-type plants. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the seed coat of these mutants showed a thinner palisade layer, but no changes were observed in proanthocyanidin accumulation or in the cuticle layer. Spectrophotometric quantification of acetyl bromide-soluble lignin components indicated changes in the amount of total polyphenolics derived from suberin and/or lignin in the mutant seeds. Finally, the increased seed coat permeability to tetrazolium salts observed in the prx2 prx25 and prx2 prx25 prx71 mutant lines suggested that the lower permeability of the seed coats caused by altered polyphenolics is likely to be the main reason explaining their reduced seed longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Circulating homogentisic acid (HGA) is elevated and deposits in connective tissues as ochronotic pigment. In this study, we aimed to define developmental and adult HGD tissue expression and determine the location and amount of gene activity required to lower circulating HGA and rescue the alkaptonuria phenotype. We generated an alkaptonuria mouse model using a knockout-first design for the disruption of the HGD gene. Hgd tm1a -/- mice showed elevated HGA and ochronosis in adulthood. LacZ staining driven by the endogenous HGD promoter was localised to only liver parenchymal cells and kidney proximal tubules in adulthood, commencing at E12.5 and E15.5 respectively. Following removal of the gene trap cassette to obtain a normal mouse with a floxed 6th HGD exon, a double transgenic was then created with Mx1-Cre which conditionally deleted HGD in liver in a dose dependent manner. 20% of HGD mRNA remaining in liver did not rescue the disease, suggesting that we need more than 20% of liver HGD to correct the disease in gene therapy. Kidney HGD activity which remained intact reduced urinary HGA, most likely by increased absorption, but did not reduce plasma HGA nor did it prevent ochronosis. In addition, downstream metabolites of exogenous 13C6-HGA, were detected in heterozygous plasma, revealing that hepatocytes take up and metabolise HGA. This novel alkaptonuria mouse model demonstrated the importance of targeting liver for therapeutic intervention, supported by our observation that hepatocytes take up and metabolise HGA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in NR2F1, which encodes a highly conserved nuclear receptor that serves as a transcriptional regulator. Previous investigations to understand the protein's role in neurodevelopment have mostly used mouse models with constitutive and tissue-specific homozygous knockout of Nr2f1. In order to represent the human disease more accurately, which is caused by heterozygous NR2F1 mutations, we investigated a heterozygous knockout mouse model, and found that this model recapitulates some of the neurological phenotypes of BBSOAS, including altered learning/memory, hearing defects, neonatal hypotonia, and decreased hippocampal volume. The mice showed altered fear memory, and further electrophysiological investigation in hippocampal slices revealed significantly reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These results suggest that a deficit or alteration in hippocampal synaptic plasticity may contribute to the intellectual disability frequently seen in BBSOAS. RNA-Seq analysis revealed significant differential gene expression in the adult Nr2f1+/- hippocampus, including the up-regulation of multiple matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which are known to be critical for the development and the plasticity of the nervous system. Taken together, our studies highlight the important role of Nr2f1 in neurodevelopment. The discovery of impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the heterozygous mouse model sheds light on the pathophysiology of altered memory and cognitive function in BBSOAS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

While we have shown that the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (serotonin) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (Flx) is ineffective as a prophylactic, we hypothesized that other serotonergic compounds such as serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT<sub>4</sub>R) agonists could act as prophylactics. We tested if three 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R agonists with varying affinity could protect against stress in two mouse strains by utilizing chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration or contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Mice were administered saline, (R,S)-ketamine, Flx, RS-67,333, prucalopride, or PF-04995274 at varying doses, and then 1 week later were subjected to chronic CORT or CFC. In C57BL/6N mice, chronic Flx administration attenuated CORT-induced weight changes and increased open-arm entries in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Chronic RS-67,333 administration attenuated CORT-mediated weight changes and protected against depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. In 129S6/SvEv mice, RS-67,333 attenuated learned fear in male, but not female mice. RS-67,333 was ineffective against stress-induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST), but prevented anxiety-like behavior in both sexes. Prucalopride and PF-04995274 attenuated learned fear and decreased stress-induced depressive-like behavior. Electrophysiological recordings following (R,S)-ketamine or prucalopride administration revealed that both drugs alter AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in CA3.

To investigate whether deletion of TRIM59 in macrophages affects the metastatic potential of melanoma cells, we polarized control and TRIM59-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages to the M2 phenotype and collected the respective conditioned media (CM). Exposure to CM from TRIM59<sup>-/-</sup>-M2 cultures significantly promoted migration and invasion by B16-F0 and B16-F10 cells. Cytokine profiling indicated a ~15-fold increase in TNF-α production in CM from TRIM59<sup>-/-</sup>-M2 cultures, and neutralizing TNF-α activity abrogated the referred stimulatory effects on cell motility. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant upregulation of <i>MMP-9</i> and <i>Madcam1</i> in melanoma cells exposed to TRIM59<sup>-/-</sup>-M2 CM. Inhibitory experiments determined that these changes were also TNF-α-dependent and mediated by activation of ERK signaling. Independent knockdown of <i>MMP9</i> and <i>Madcam1</i> in B16-F10 cells impeded epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and formation of metastatic lung nodules in vivo. These data suggest TRIM59 expression attenuates the tumor-promoting effect of tumor-associated macrophages, most of which resemble the M2 phenotype. Moreover, they highlight the relevance of TRIM59 in macrophages as a potential regulator of tumor metastasis and suggest TRIM59 could serve as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy.</AbstractText>"}

N-linked glycans are co-translationally attached to the Asn7 and Asn24 residues on the FSHβ subunit.

The relative abundance of FSH glycoforms changes with advanced reproductive age, shifting from predominantly FSH21/18 in younger women to FSH24 in older women. Previous in vitro studies in granulosa cell lines and in vivo studies using Fshb null mice showed these glycoforms elicit differential bioactivities. However, the direct effects of FSH glycoforms on the mouse ovarian follicle have not yet been determined. In this study, we isolated secondary follicles from pre-pubertal mice and treated them with 20- or 100 ng/mL purified recombinant FSH glycoforms for one-hour or 18-20 hours. Analysis of phosphorylated PKA substrates showed that glycoforms were bioactive in follicles following one-hour treatment, although differential bioactivity was only observed with the 100 ng/mL dose. Treatment of follicles with 100 ng/mL of each glycoform also induced distinct expression patterns of FSH-responsive genes as assessed by qPCR, consistent with differential function.

The addition of PDA improved the stability of the coating compared to PSB alone, without compromising the anti-fouling properties of the film. PDA-PSB coating reduced protein adsorption by 89% compared to bare Si samples, while fibroblast adhesion was reduced by 86%. PDA-PSB coated silicon based neural probes were implanted into mouse brain, and the inflammatory tissue responses to the implants were assessed by immunohistochemistry one week after implantation. The PSB-PDA coated implants showed a significantly decreased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for reactive astrocytes, within 70 μm from the electrode-tissue interface (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the coating reduced the microglia activation as shown in decreased Iba-1 and lectin staining, and improved blood-brain barrier integrity indicated by reduced immunoglobulin (IgG) leakage into the tissue around the probes.

This question is of particular importance in psychopathology, where enhanced attention to threat is a putative feature of pathological anxiety. Using an aversive reversal learning task that required subjects to learn, and exploit, predictions about multiple stimuli, we show that the allocation of visual attention is influenced significantly by aversive value but not by uncertainty. Moreover, this relationship is bidirectional in that attention biases value updates for attended stimuli, resulting in heightened value estimates.

Regulatory gene expression networks were identified using linear mixed-effect models and dynamic regulatory events miner (DREM). Differential gene expression analysis identified a core set of genes increased or decreased before fibrosis was histologically evident that continued to change with advanced fibrosis. DREM generated a systems biology model (www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/IPFReg) that identified progressively divergent gene expression tracks with microRNAs and transcription factors that specifically regulate mild or advanced fibrosis. We confirmed model predictions by demonstrating that expression of POU2AF1, previously unassociated with lung fibrosis but proposed by the model as regulator, is increased in B lymphocytes in IPF lungs and that POU2AF1-knockout mice were protected from bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

Whether live kidney donation impacts on exercise tolerance is unknown. Here recovery post renal transplant and donation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing is investigated. <b>Methods:</b> Renal donors (<i>n</i> = 28) and recipients (<i>n</i> = 24) undertook a cardiopulmonary exercise test, Duke activity score index and patient reported health score questionnaires pre-operatively and in the 7th and 14th week post-operatively. Anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake and ventilatory equivalents were measured in relation to activity and reported health scores. Haemoglobin and renal function was recorded. <b>Results:</b> Recipients showed impaired cardiopulmonary function compared to donors with lower anaerobic threshold (10.5 vs. 14.4 ml/kg/min) and peak oxygen uptake (18.5 vs 23.0 ml/kg/min). Post-operatively the anaerobic threshold of recipients improved and normalised by the 14th week, whereas that in donors fell by ∼20% by the 7th (mean 11.4 ml/kg/min), recovering by the 14th (mean 15.6 ml/kg/min). Reported health but not activity scores showed similar changes. <b>Conclusions:</b> Recovery following renal transplantation and donation differ. Transplantation improves renal function resulting in an increase in anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen uptake which essentially normalise by the 14th week post-operatively. Donors suffer a 20% reduction in cardiopulmonary reserve post-operatively, which recovers by the 14th week, suggesting no associated chronic exercise intolerance. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a real-time predictor of functional capacity and thus is used as a pre-operative tool to measure physiological fitness and predict outcomes. Renal failure is associated with exercise intolerance and transplantation is transformational in terms of quality of life, longevity and healthcare cost. Live - related renal donation is increasingly available but whether donation itself carries a long-term health burden has not been previously well established. This study suggests that renal donation is not associated with long-term cardiopulmonary compromise and patients who donate their kidneys recover their previous fitness within 14 weeks.</AbstractText>"}

Many compounds and natural products have antioxidant activity in vitro; however, it is often difficult to reproduce their effects in vivo. Additionally, methods to measure antioxidant activities in cells are also scarce. Here, we investigated the antioxidant activity of milk proteins by observing the formation of arsenite-induced stress granules as a tool to evaluate antioxidant activity in cells. Milk proteins not only decreased the formation of stress granules in several cell types but also scavenged 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cations in vitro. In addition, milk proteins inhibited cellular senescence based on an SA-β-galactosidase assay, and increased differentiation to myotubes from myoblasts isolated from the skeletal muscles of mouse pups. Taken together, our results demonstrate that milk proteins have an antiaging effect, especially prevention of skeletal muscle loss, through their antioxidant activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Our results provide that antioxidant effects of milk proteins containing α-caseins, β-caseins, and β-lactoglobulin can mitigate aging-related damage induced by oxidative stress through showing inhibition of cellular senescence and increase of differentiation and maturation of myoblast. Therefore, we suggest that milk proteins could be potent health supplements to prevent aging-associated diseases, especially sarcopenia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This age-related decrease in dynamic range of function of regional gray matter may be, in part, due to age-related degradation of regional white matter tracts. Here, a lifespan sample of 171 healthy adults (aged 20-94) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning including diffusion-weighted imaging (for tractography) and functional imaging (a digit n-back task). We utilized structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis that age-related decrements in white matter microstructure are associated with altered blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) modulation, and both in turn, are associated with scanner-task accuracy and executive function performance. Specified structural equation model evidenced good fit, demonstrating that increased age negatively affects n-back task accuracy and executive function performance in part due to both degraded white matter tract microstructure and reduced task-difficulty-related BOLD modulation. We further demonstrated that poorer white matter microstructure integrity was associated with weakened BOLD modulation, particularly in regions showing positive modulation effects, as opposed to negative modulation effects. This structure-function association study provides further evidence that structural connectivity influences functional activation, and the two mechanisms in tandem are predictive of cognitive performance, both during the task, and for cognition measured outside the scanner environment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme has attracted attention due to its involvement in tumor progression in various cancers. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical importance of LOX expression and its epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Using a database of 284 ESCCs, we examined LOX expression and its prognostic characteristics. The functional role of LOX was assessed by in vitro growth, migration, and invasion assays. The relationship between LOX expression, global DNA hypomethylation (ie, LINE-1 methylation), and LOX promoter methylation was evaluated by using mRNA expression arrays and pyrosequencing technology. High LOX expression cases had a significantly shorter overall survival and cancer-specific survival (log-rank, P &lt; .001). The prognostic effect of LOX expression was not significantly modified by other clinical variables. Silencing and enzymatic inhibition of LOX suppressed growth and reduced the invasion and migration ability of ESCC cell lines along with the downregulation of AKT and MMP2. An integrated gene analysis in tissues and cell lines revealed that LOX was the most highly upregulated gene in LINE-1 hypomethylated tumors. In vitro, LOX expression was upregulated following DNA demethylation. LOX promoter methylation was not associated with LOX expression. Conclusively LOX expression was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC and was regulated epigenetically by genome-wide hypomethylation. It could serve as a prognostic biomarker in ESCC patients, and therapeutically targeting LOX could reverse the progression of esophageal cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Interestingly, ageing and Alzheimer's disease have been associated with an abnormal upregulation of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), a fine tuner of synaptic plasticity. However, the link between A2AR signalling and tau pathology has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we report for the first time a significant upregulation of A2AR in patients suffering from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with the MAPT P301L mutation. To model these alterations, we induced neuronal A2AR upregulation in a tauopathy mouse model (THY-Tau22) using a new conditional strain allowing forebrain overexpression of the receptor. We found that neuronal A2AR upregulation increases tau hyperphosphorylation, potentiating the onset of tau-induced memory deficits. This detrimental effect was linked to a singular microglial signature as revealed by RNA sequencing analysis. In particular, we found that A2AR overexpression in THY-Tau22 mice led to the hippocampal upregulation of C1q complement protein-also observed in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration-and correlated with the loss of glutamatergic synapses, likely underlying the observed memory deficits. These data reveal a key impact of overactive neuronal A2AR in the onset of synaptic loss in tauopathies, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

The studies are the Monash University stereologically analyzed series of 319 autopsy kidneys from the United States in which 44% were white and the Mayo Clinic CT angiogram/biopsy analysis of 1,388 US kidney donors in which 97% were white. Hypertension rates in the Monash series were 48% and included moderate and severe hypertension. In the Mayo Clinic study, 12% had mild hypertension. The studies showed no relationship between glomerular number and hypertension except for a weak relationship with older white women in the Monash series. An inverse relationship was present between glomerular number and glomerular volume, a reciprocity that tended to enhance glomerular mass and by inference filtration capacity with lower nephron numbers. This relationship seemed to be present whether low nephron numbers were intrinsic or acquired. In the Mayo Clinic studies, pretransplant iothalamate clearances demonstrated that single nephron (SN) glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were similar throughout the range of glomerular number in subjects younger than 70 years, but that increased SNGFR correlated with nephron hypertrophy and increased nephrosclerosis particularly at 70 years of age and over. Hypertension at least through middle age cannot be related to a deficiency of glomeruli, but glomeruli are lost with later aging in association with adaptive nephron hypertrophy that can maintain GFR near normal. These studies help define an age-related nephropathy that overlaps with hypertension as a potential cause of end-stage renal disease when glomerulosclerosis is advanced.

The authors used MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for original research articles (human and animal studies), registries data, case reports, review articles, and pertinent online publications using the combinations of the following search terms: local anesthetics, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, intralipid, lipid emulsion, Exparel, ultrasound-guidance, regional anesthesia, lidocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, cocaine, procaine, tetracaine, levobupivacaine, liposomal bupivacaine, lignocaine. Local anesthetic systemic toxicity continues to occur despite the use of putatively less cardiotoxic formulations of local anesthetics and more common use of ultrasound guidance. The elderly appear to be at a disproportionately increased risk for toxicity owing to the presence of relevant comorbidities and decreased muscle mass. Examination of recent case reports involving patients over the age of 65 years demonstrates that inadvertent overdosing is responsible for some cases of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. Elderly patients are at increased risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. When considering use of local anesthetics in older patients, special attention should be paid to the presence of systemic disease and muscle wasting. The safety of regional anesthesia and multi-modal analgesia among these at-risk patients will be improved by educating physicians and staff to recognize and manage local anesthetic systemic toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

The alterations that occur thence promote oncogene expression. Some questions, that are not answered with certainty by current consensus mechanisms of tumourigenesis, are elegantly explained by the triggering of tumours being a property of the physical characteristics of the ECM, which is operative following loading of the tumour initiation process with a relevant gene variant. Clinical observations are consistent with this alternative hypothesis which is derived from studies that have, together, accumulated an extensive variety of data incorporating biochemical, genetic and clinical findings. Thus, this review provides support for the view that the ECM may have an executive function in induction of a tumour. Overall, reported observations suggest that either restoring an ECM associated with homeostasis or targeting the related signal transduction mechanisms may possibly be utilised to modify or control the early progression of cancers. The review provides a coherent template for discussing the notion, in the context of contemporary knowledge, that tumourigenesis is an alliance of biochemistry, genetics and biophysics, in which the physical architecture of the ECM may be a fundamental component. For more definitive clarification of the concept there needs to be a phalanx of experiments conceived around direct questions that are raised by this paper.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, in the present study we evaluated the effect of IL-6 deficiency and aging on expression of p53, connected with accumulation of age-related cellular damages, in hippocampus of 4- and 24-month-old IL-6-deficient C57BL/6J (IL-6KO) and wild type control (WT) mice. The accumulation of p53 protein in hippocampus of aged IL-6KO mice was significantly lower than in aged WT ones, while p53 mRNA level was significantly higher in IL-6-deficient mice, what indicates that the effect was independent on p53 transcription. Presence of few apoptotic cells in hippocampal dentate gyrus and lack of changes in levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, antiapoptotic Bcl-2, as well as in p21 protein in aged animals of both genotypes, points to low transcriptional activity of p53, especially in aged WT mice. Because the amount of p53 protein did not correlate with the level of Mdm2 protein, its main negative regulator, other than Mdm2-dependent mechanism was involved in p53 build-up. Significantly higher mRNA levels of autophagy-associated genes: Pten, Tsc2, and Dram1 in IL-6KO mice, in conjunction with significantly lower amount of Bcl-2 protein in 4-month-old IL-6KO mice, suggests that lack of IL-6/STAT3/Bcl-2 signaling could account for better autophagy performance in these mice, preventing excessive accumulation of proteins. Taken together, attenuated p53 protein build-up, absence of enhanced apoptosis, and transcriptional up-regulation of autophagy-associated genes imply that IL-6 deficiency may protect hippocampus from age-related accumulation of cellular damages.</AbstractText>"}

The objective of this study was to develop optimal genetic evaluations for these traits in the Canadian Angus population. Guidelines recommended by Beef Improvement Federation (BIF) were used to score teat and udder structure in 1,735 Canadian Angus cows from 10 representative herds. Cows scored ranged in parity from 1 to 13; however, &gt;70% of cows were parity ≤4. Scores ranged from 1 (large, bottle shaped) to 9 (very small) for teats and from 1 (very pendulous) to 9 (very tight) for udders. Consistent with parity distribution, &gt;70% of teat and udder scores were ≥6. Teat and udder scores (TS9 and US9, respectively) were modeled using a multiple trait animal model with random effects of contemporary group (herd-year-season) and additive genetic effect, and fixed effects of breed, parity group, and days between calving and scoring. To test good versus poor structure, a binary classification of 1 or 2 (TS2, US2) [comprised of scores 1 to 5 = 1 (poor structure) and scores 6 to 9 = 2 (good structure)] was created. Further, to assess the impact of grouping less frequently observed poor scores, a 1 to 7 scale (TS7, US7) was created by combining teat and udder scores 1 to 3. Analyses for teat and udder scores on scales TS9, US9, TS7, US7, and TS2, US2 were compared. In addition, both threshold and linear animal models were used to estimate variance components for the traits. Data treatment and models were evaluated based on correlation of resulting estimated breeding value (EBV) with corrected phenotypes, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, average EBV accuracies (r), and deviance information criteria (DIC). TS9, US9 scales for teat and udder scores and linear models performed best. Estimates of heritability (SE) for teat and udder score were 0.32 (0.06) and 0.15 (0.04), respectively, indicating these traits were moderately heritable and that genetic improvement for teat and udder scores was possible. Estimates of phenotypic and genotypic correlations for teat and udder score were 0.46 (0.02) and 0.71 (0.09), respectively. Estimates of genotypic correlations with birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), and yearling weight (YW), ranged from -0.04 (0.10) to -0.20 (0.12), verifying the importance of selecting for improved teat and udder score as individual traits, alongside performance traits.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

As the austerity agenda in the UK cuts state-funded service provision for older people despite increasing demand, social enterprise has become a politically and economically attractive model for the sustainable delivery of some public services. Yet little is known about the impact of social enterprise on the health and wellbeing of older people. In this paper we address this gap in understanding and consider social enterprise activities as complex public health-promoting interventions. Our study aimed to understand what impact social enterprise activities had on the health and wellbeing of participants aged over 50, and also how that impact was created. To achieve this, we conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with a sample (n = 43) of staff, volunteers, clients and carers aged over 50 who were involved in activities delivered by three social enterprises. Using a thematic analysis to explore manifest and latent themes, two antecedents of subjective younger age emerged explaining how benefit was created, namely downward social comparison and identity. The social enterprise activities we studied benefited participants' health and wellbeing, impacting positively on participants' sense of purpose, social support, connectedness and inclusion. These health and wellbeing benefits can be considered as outcomes of complex public health interventions for older people, and we relate these outcomes to beneficial conditions within the intermediary social determinants of health. We conclude by discussing the future impact of social enterprise activities and current UK policy on the structural determinants of health.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, its administration and content differs by country and region, precluding direct comparison of scores across versions. Our objective was to compare two methods of deriving comparable scores across MMSE versions. The International Neuropsychological Normative Database Initiative collected MMSE scores on over 120,000 individuals from 47 studies in 35 countries. We used MMSE data from N=80,559 adults aged 41-99 years from 22 studies that provided item-level response data. We first equated 14-point, 15-point, 18-point, 19-point, and 23-point versions of the MMSE to the original 30-point version using coarse equipercentile equating methods that preserved differences across continent, age, and years of education. We then derived more precise item response theory based scores using item-level responses to MMSE component items. We compared the two score equating approaches using correlation and Bland-Altman plots. Both test equating approaches were highly correlated with each other (r=0.73) and with raw MMSE point totals. Bland-Altman plots revealed minimal evidence of systematic differences between the approaches. Our findings support the use of equipercentile equating when item-level data are unavailable to facilitate development of international test norms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

As populations age there is a concomitant increase in age-related chronic diseases. One such disease is chronic kidney disease (CKD), which becomes more prevalent with age, especially over age 70 y. Individuals with CKD are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, in part because arterial calcification increases as kidney function declines. Vitamin K is a shortfall nutrient among older adults that has been implicated in arterial calcification. Evidence suggests CKD patients have low vitamin K status, but data are equivocal because the biomarkers of vitamin K status can be influenced by CKD. Animal studies provide more compelling data on the underlying role of vitamin K in arterial calcification associated with CKD. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding the role of vitamin K in CKD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This may reflect an awareness of limited lifetime unique to humans, leading to a greater interest in maintaining social relationships at the expense of the non-social world in the face of limited cognitive and physical resources. Alternately, fundamental biological processes common to other primate species may direct preferential interest in social stimuli with increasing age. Inspired by a recent study that described a sustained interest in social stimuli but diminished interest in non-social stimuli in aged Barbary macaques, we carried out a conceptual replication to test whether old rhesus monkeys lost interest in non-social stimuli. Male and female macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>; <i>N</i> = 243) 4-30 years old were tested with a food puzzle outfitted with an activity monitor to evaluate their propensity to manipulate the puzzle in order to free a food reward. We found no indication that aged monkeys were less interested in the puzzle than young monkeys, nor were they less able to solve it.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although several people previously involved in the synthesis of these materials claimed Novichok agents to be five to eight times more potent than VX, a deadly nerve agent, no open data on these species are currently available. To bridge this gap, we herein performed a theoretical study on several Novichok agent candidates and conducted natural population charge analysis to evaluate the possible mechanisms of their toxicity, suggesting that these agents might promote the ageing and deformation of acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, the reaction of Novichok agents with acetylcholinesterase serine was calculated to be most thermodynamically favoured for Novichok candidate A234.

These two methods are fundamentally different, but their results are often used interchangeably to describe the brain's resting-state, baseline, or intrinsic activity. While the DMN was initially defined by consistent task-based decreases in blood flow in a set of specific brain regions using PET imaging, recently nearly all studies on the DMN employ functional connectivity in rs-fMRI. In this study, we first show the high level of spatial overlap between NBR and functional connectivity of the DMN extracted from the same tb-fMRI scan; then, we demonstrate that the NBR in putative DMN regions can be significantly altered without causing any change in their overlapping functional connectivity. Furthermore, we present evidence that in the DMN, the NBR is more closely related to task performance than the functional connectivity. We conclude that the NBR and functional connectivity of the DMN reflect two separate but overlapping neurophysiological processes, and thus should be differentiated in studies investigating brain-behavior relationships in both healthy and diseased populations. Our findings further raise the possibility that the macro-scale networks of the human brain might internally exhibit a hierarchical functional architecture.</AbstractText>"}

When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address this question, we compared two seasonal IAVs (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and two IBVs (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation of HA by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein enzymes, many of which proved to be present in human respiratory epithelium. The IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with much higher efficiency than IAV HA0. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, abrogated spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. Second, the HA fusion pH values proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (with one exception being the HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33°C, a temperature required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host adaptation during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza epidemics are caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses (IAV and IBV, respectively). IBV causes substantial disease; however, it is far less studied than IAV. While IAV originates from animal reservoirs, IBV circulates in humans only. Virus spread requires that the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is active and sufficiently stable in human airways. We resolve here how these mechanisms differ between IBV and IAV. Whereas human IAVs rely on one particular protease for HA activation, this is not the case for IBV. Superior activation of IBV by several proteases should enhance shedding of infectious particles. IBV HA exhibits acid stability and a preference for 33°C, indicating pronounced adaptation to the human upper airways, where the pH is mildly acidic and a cooler temperature exists. These adaptive features are rationalized by the long existence of IBV in humans and may have broader relevance for understanding the biology and evolution of respiratory viruses.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Genetic predisposition, epigenetic changes, aging and accumulated life-long environmental exposures are known ALS risk factors. The complex and dynamic interplay between these pathological influences plays a role in disease onset and progression. Recently, the gut microbiome has also been implicated in ALS development. In addition, immune cell populations are differentially expanded and activated in ALS compared to healthy individuals. However, the temporal evolution of both the intestinal flora and the immune system relative to symptom onset in ALS is presently not fully understood. To better elucidate the timeline of the various potential pathological factors, we performed a longitudinal study to simultaneously assess the gut microbiome, immunophenotype and changes in ileum and brain epigenetic marks relative to motor behavior and muscle atrophy in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) familial ALS mouse model. We identified alterations in the gut microbial environment early in the life of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> animals followed by motor dysfunction and muscle atrophy, and immune cell expansion and activation, particularly in the spinal cord. Global brain cytosine hydroxymethylation was also altered in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> animals at disease end-stage compared to control mice. Correlation analysis confirmed interrelationships with the microbiome and immune system. This study serves as a starting point to more deeply comprehend the influence of gut microorganisms and the immune system on ALS onset and progression.

Methods and Results STRRIDE (Studies of a Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention Through Defined Exercise) trial participants who were originally randomized to exercise training for 8 months and participated in the 10-year follow-up visit were included. CRF levels were measured at baseline, after training (8 months), and at 10-year follow-up as peak oxygen uptake (vo<sub>2</sub>, mL/kg per min) using the maximal treadmill test. Participants were stratified into low, moderate, and high CRF response groups according to the training regimen-specific tertiles of CRF change. The study included 80 participants (age: 52 years; 35% female). At 10-year follow-up, the high-response CRF group had the least decline in CRF compared with the moderate- and low-response CRF groups (-0.35 versus -2.20 and -4.25 mL/kg per minute, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.02). This result was largely related to the differential age-related changes in peak oxygen pulse across the 3 groups (0.58, -0.23, and -0.86 mL/beat, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.03) with no difference in the peak heart rate change. In adjusted linear regression analysis, high response was significantly associated with greater CRF at follow-up independent of other baseline characteristics (high versus low [reference] CRF response: standard β=0.25; <i>P</i>=0.004). Conclusions Greater CRF improvement in response to short-term training is associated with higher CRF levels 10 years later.

To counter these challenges, primary care professionals need to take up new and innovative practices, including eHealth. eHealth applications hold the promise to overcome some difficulties encountered in the care of people with complex medical and social needs in primary care. However, many unanswered questions regarding (cost) effectiveness, integration with healthcare, and acceptability to patients, caregivers, and professionals remain to be elucidated. What conditions need to be met? What challenges need to be overcome? What downsides must be dealt with? This first paper in a series on eHealth in primary care introduces basic concepts and examines opportunities for the uptake of eHealth in primary care. We illustrate that although the potential of eHealth in primary care is high, several conditions need to be met to ensure that safe and high-quality eHealth is developed for and implemented in primary care. eHealth research needs to be optimized; ensuring evidence-based eHealth is available. Blended care, i.e. combining face-to-face care with remote options, personalized to the individual patient should be considered. Stakeholders need to be involved in the development and implementation of eHealth via co-creation processes, and design should be mindful of vulnerable groups and eHealth illiteracy. Furthermore, a global perspective on eHealth should be adopted, and eHealth ethics, patients' safety and privacy considered.</AbstractText>"}

Physical activity (PA), particularly low-impact activities like bicycling, can improve health in older adults. However, bicycling rates are lower in the Midwest than other regions in the United States. Therefore, it is important to identify unique social, personal, and environmental factors that inhibit or promote bicycling, and how these are associated with PA. The influences of these factors were explored using the social ecological model. <i>Method</i>. A cross-sectional online survey was developed using previously validated local and national bicycling questionnaires, then distributed to Midwestern bicyclists 50 years and older. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to understand the influences of social, personal, and environmental barriers and promoters on bicycling patterns. All models were conducted separately by gender, and accounted for age, race, education, marital status, income, and employment. <i>Results</i>. Social promoters (B = 0.386, <i>p</i> = .002), such as having friends/family that bicycle were associated with greater PA. Personal promoters (B = -0.311, <i>p</i> = .006) such as needing to lose weight were associated with reduced PA. Environmental factors had no associations with PA. However, individual environmental components, such as number of vehicles on the roads, were significantly associated with PA for both males and females. Females reported more barriers than males. The overall model accounted for 16.1% of the total variance in PA levels. <i>Conclusion</i>. Interventions to promote PA via bicycling in older adults should focus on social factors, while also reducing personal-level factors for males. Interventions for females could focus on reducing specific personal, social, and environmental barriers.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we aimed to determine how vascular senescence and the onset of estrogen treatment influence the common carotid artery (CCA) function in senescent and non-senescent females. Ovariectomized female senescence-accelerated (SAMP8) or non-senescent (SAMR1) mice were treated with vehicle (OVX) or 17β-estradiol starting at the day of ovariectomy (early-onset, E<sub>2</sub>E) or 45 days after surgery (late-onset, E<sub>2</sub>L). In SAMR1, both treatments, E<sub>2</sub>E and E<sub>2</sub>L, reduced constriction to phenylephrine (Phe) in CCA [(AUC) OVX: 193.8 ± 15.5; E<sub>2</sub>E: 128.1 ± 11.6; E<sub>2</sub>L: 130.2 ± 15.8, <i>p</i> = 0.004] in association with positive regulation of NO/O2- ratio and increased prostacyclin production.

Analysis of wild-type receptor alpha (ERα66) expression and its variants revealed an increased expression of ERα36 in E<sub>2</sub>L-SAMP8 in correlation with unfavorable effects of estrogen in those animals. In conclusion, estrogen exerts beneficial effects in non-senescent CCA, regardless of the initiation of the therapy. In senescent CCA, however, estrogen loses its beneficial action even when administered shortly after ovariectomy and may become detrimental when given late after ovariectomy. Aging and onset of estrogen treatment are two critical factors in the mechanism of action of this hormone in CCA.</AbstractText>"}

We herein revisit the origin of two of these stresses, namely mitochondrial metabolic compromise, associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and replicative senescence, activated by extreme telomere shortening. We discuss how replication stress-induced DNA damage of telomeric DNA (telDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be considered a common origin of senescence in vitro, with consequences on ageing in vivo. Unexpectedly, mtDNA and telDNA share common features indicative of a high degree of replicative stress, such as G-quadruplexes, D-loops, RNA:DNA heteroduplexes, epigenetic marks, or supercoiling. To avoid these stresses, both compartments use similar enzymatic strategies involving, for instance, endonucleases, topoisomerases, helicases, or primases. Surprisingly, many of these replication helpers are active at both telDNA and mtDNA (e.g., RNAse H1, FEN1, DNA2, RecQ helicases, Top2α, Top2β, TOP3A, DNMT1/3a/3b, SIRT1). In addition, specialized telomeric proteins, such as TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) and TERC (telomerase RNA component), or TIN2 (shelterin complex), shuttle from telomeres to mitochondria, and, by doing so, modulate mitochondrial metabolism and the production of ROS, in a feedback manner. Hence, mitochondria and telomeres use common weapons and cooperate to resist/prevent replication stresses, otherwise producing common consequences, namely senescence and ageing.</AbstractText>"}

Residents of co-housing communities live in their own apartments but undertake activities together and support one another. This paper adds to the literature by scrutinizing the benefits and drawbacks of senior co-housing, with special focus on the forms and limits of social support and the implications for the experience of loneliness. Qualitative fieldwork was conducted in eight co-housing communities in the Netherlands, consisting of document analysis, interviews, focus groups, and observations. The research shows that co-housing communities offer social contacts, social control, and instrumental and emotional support. Residents set boundaries regarding the frequency and intensity of support. The provided support partly relieves residents' adult children from caregiving duties but does not substitute formal and informal care. Due to their access to contacts and support, few residents experience social loneliness. Co-housing communities can potentially also alleviate emotional loneliness, but currently, this happens to a limited degree. The paper concludes with practical recommendations for enhancing the benefits and reducing the drawbacks of senior co-housing.</AbstractText>"}

Genomic instability in breast cancer leads to mutations, copy number variations, and genetic rearrangements, while epigenetic remodeling involves alteration by DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNAs (miRNAs) of gene expression profiles. The accrued scientific findings strongly suggest epigenetic dysregulation in breast cancer pathogenesis though genomic instability is central to breast cancer hallmarks. Being reversible and plastic, epigenetic processes appear more amenable toward therapeutic intervention than the more unidirectional genetic alterations. In this review, we discuss the epigenetic reprogramming associated with breast cancer such as shuffling of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, and miRNAs expression profiles. As part of this, we illustrate how epigenetic instability orchestrates the attainment of cancer hallmarks which stimulate the neoplastic transformation-tumorigenesis-malignancy cascades. As reversibility of epigenetic controls is a promising feature to optimize for devising novel therapeutic approaches, we also focus on the strategies for restoring the epistate that favor improved disease outcome and therapeutic intervention.</AbstractText>"}

We will therefore provide an overview of HRQoL studies in patients with ACC. We found six studies that measured HRQoL in 323 patients with ACC (3 cross-sectional, 1 cohort, 2 trials), all indicating a reduced HRQoL compared to the general population. The FIRMACT trial found that HRQoL of patients with ACC was reduced compared to the general population, and that chemotherapy-mitotane further reduced HRQoL even though survival improved. Clinical aspects of the disease, including cortisol and aldosterone production and adrenal insufficiency have shown great impact on HRQoL in benign disease, even after the recovery of hormonal status. However, the impact of malignant adrenal disease and treatment options on HRQoL including adrenalectomy, radiotherapy, mitotane therapy, and chemotherapy have not been sufficiently studied in patients with ACC. Although the number of HRQoL studies in patients with ACC is limited, the existing literature does indicate that ACC has a large impact on patients' HRQoL, with disease specific aspects. Further HRQoL research in patients with ACC is essential to improve patient-centered care, preferably by using an ACC-specific HRQoL questionnaire.</AbstractText>"}

Population ageing is projected to lead to workforce shortages, welfare dependency, fiscal unsustainability, and a higher burden of chronic diseases on health care system. Promoting health and sustainable work capacity among mature age and older workers hence becomes the most important and critical way to address all these challenges. This paper used the pooled data from the longitudinal Household, Incomes and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey 2002-2011 data to investigate common and different factors predicting voluntary or involuntary workforce transitions among workers aged 45 to 64. Long term health conditions and preference to work less hours increased while having a working partner and proportion of paid years decreased both voluntary and involuntary work force transitions. Besides these four common factors, the voluntary and involuntary workforce transitions had very different underlying mechanisms. Our findings suggest that government policies aimed at promoting workforce participation at later life should be directed specifically to life-long health promotion and continuous employment as well as different factors driving voluntary and involuntary workforce transitions, such as life-long training, healthy lifestyles, work flexibility, ageing friendly workplace, and job security.</AbstractText>"}

Melatonin, a highly conserved ancient molecule, plays a crucial role in the maintenance of skin. As human skin has functional melatonin receptors and also acts as a complete system that is capable of producing and regulating melatonin synthesis, melatonin is a promising candidate for its maintenance and protection. Below, we review the studies of new metabolic pathways involved in the protective functions of melatonin in dermal cells. We also discuss the advantages of the topical use of melatonin for therapeutic purposes and skin protection. In our view, endogenous intracutaneous melatonin production, together with topically-applied exogenous melatonin and its metabolites, represent two of the most potent defense systems against external damage to the skin.</AbstractText>"}

We show that NINJ2 is overexpressed in established (HT-29) and primary CRC cells and in human colon cancer tissues. Its expression level is low in colon epithelial cells and normal colon tissues. NINJ2 shRNA or knockout (by CRSIPR/Cas9) potently inhibited human CRC cell survival and proliferation, while significantly inducing cell apoptosis. Conversely, lentivirus-mediated NINJ2 overexpression promoted CRC cell proliferation. NINJ2 co-immunoprecipitated with multiple RTKs (EGFR, PDGFRα/β and FGFR) in CRC cells and human colon cancer tissues. In HT-29 cells, RTKs' downstream signalings, Akt and Erk, were significantly inhibited by NINJ2 shRNA or knockout, but augmented following ectopic NINJ2 overexpression. <i>In vivo</i>, NINJ2-silenced or NINJ2-knockout CRC xenografts grew significantly slower than the control xenografts.

In addition, intrinsic pathways govern axon development, although the extent to which axons themselves can influence their own growth is unknown. We find that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons secrete a factor supporting axon growth and identify it as the C terminus of the ER stress-induced transcription factor CREB3L2, which is generated by site 2 protease (S2P) cleavage in sensory neurons. S2P and CREB3L2 knockdown or inhibition of axonal S2P interfere with the growth of axons, and C-terminal CREB3L2 is sufficient to rescue these effects. C-terminal CREB3L2 forms a complex with Shh and stabilizes its association with the Patched-1 receptor on developing axons.

What are the culprits leading to neuron firing instability? The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is central to AD pathogenesis, and we recently showed that its intracellular domain (AICD) could modify synaptic signal integration. We now hypothesize that AICD modifies neuron firing activity, thus contributing to the disruption of memory processes. Using cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques, we show that pathological AICD levels weaken CA1 neuron firing activity through a gene-transcription-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, increased AICD production in hippocampal neurons modifies oscillatory activity, specifically in the γ-frequency range, and disrupts spatial memory task. Collectively, our data suggest that AICD pathological levels, observed in AD mouse models and in human patients, might contribute to progressive neuron homeostatic failure, driving the shift from normal aging to AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Life-space mobility defines the frequency and extent of movements in the environment, and lower life-space mobility is associated with adverse health outcomes and MCI. Currently, the underlying mechanism of this association is not well understood. This study examined the functional neural correlates of life-space mobility in community-dwelling older adults with MCI. We first conducted a cross-sectional investigation of the association between resting-state default mode network (DMN) and sensori-motor network (SMN) connectivity and life-space mobility (assessed by the Life-Space Assessment (LSA)) among 60 community-dwelling older adults with MCI using aggregated data from two studies - baseline data from a randomized controlled trial (n = 20) and baseline data from a 12-month prospective study (n = 40). Using data from the 12-month prospective study (n = 35), we then examined whether baseline internetwork connectivity predicts reduced life-space mobility over 12 months. The cross-sectional analysis showed higher DMN-SMN connectivity was associated with lower LSA scores after adjusting for baseline global cognitive function and baseline age (p &lt; 0.01). A significant reduction in LSA scores was observed in the 35 participants of the 12-month prospective study (paired sample t-test mean change = -6.53, p = 0.01). Greater baseline DMN-SMN connectivity was associated with greater reduction in life-space mobility at 12 months (p = 0.04) after adjusting for baseline age, global cognitive function, and LSA score. Our findings suggest that lower and reduced life-space mobility in older adults with MCI may be due to altered functional architecture of the brain such that normal neuro-cognitive motor behaviours may be disrupted.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Little is known about skeletal changes following stroke beyond density loss. In this study we use a mild-moderate middle cerebral artery occlusion model to determine the effects of ischemic stroke without bedrest on bone microstructure, dynamic bone formation, and tissue composition. Twenty-seven 12-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice received either a stroke or sham surgery and then either received daily treadmill exercise or remained sedentary for four weeks. All mice were ambulatory immediately following stroke, and limb coordination during treadmill exercise was unaffected by stroke, indicating similar mechanical loading across limbs for surgery groups. Stroke did not directly detriment microstructure, but exercise only stimulated adaptation in sham group, not stroke group, with increased bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness in the sham distal femoral metaphysis. Stroke differentially decreased cortical area in the affected limb relative to the unaffected limb of the distal femoral metaphysis, and endosteal bone formation rate in the affected tibial diaphysis. Although exercise failed to improve bone microstructure following stroke, exercise increased mineral-to-matrix content in stroke but not sham. Together, these results show that stroke inhibits exercise-induced changes to femoral microstructure but not tibial composition, even without changes to gait. Similarly, affected-unaffected limb differences in cortical bone structure and bone formation rate in ambulatory mice show that stroke affects bone health even without bedrest.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2019 by ASME.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We found that after mouse femoral artery denudation with a guide wire, 5-MTP accelerated recovery of endothelium in the denuded area and reduced vascular leakage and intimal thickening. 5-MTP increased endothelial cell proliferation in the denuded arteries and rescued TNF-α-reduced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, likely via maintaining vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 activation. In contrast, 5-MTP preserved differentiated phenotype of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and decreased VSMC proliferation and migration. Furthermore, 5-MTP maintained expression levels of critical transcription factors for VSMC marker gene expressions via attenuated activation of p38 MAPK and NFκB-p65. Our findings uncover a novel protective mechanism of 5-MTP in restenosis. In response to denudation injury, 5-MTP attenuates intimal hyperplasia via concerted but opposing actions on endothelial cells and VSMCs. Taken together, our results suggest that 5-MTP is a valuable therapeutic target for arterial injury-induced restenosis.</AbstractText>"}

Although, the molecular features are clear, colon cancer subgroups based interventions are limited. To address this problem, we analyze the CMS and NMF subgroup guided drug sensitivity in colon cancer cell lines. CMS3 subtype cells are sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil, while, CMS4 subtype cells are sensitive to cisplatin treatment. In NMF classification, a sub-cluster is specifically sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors, PI3K-mTOR inhibitors and NOTCH inhibitor treatment. This sub-cluster has low frequency of TP53, POLE, PIK3CA and BRAF mutation. Transcriptional analysis demonstrates low NOTCH signaling activity, low CDX2 and VDR expression in this sub-cluster. CDX2 and VDR are significantly associated with the sensitivity of chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors. Moreover, a positive correlation between VDR and CDX2 is identified. VDR and CDX2 mediated regulatory networks are constructed. At last, three or four sub-clusters classification is validated in colon cancer patients. Overall, our results suggest a molecular sub-cluster of colon cancer cells with low CDX2 and VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment and provide an example of translation of cancer classification to subgroup guided therapies.</AbstractText>"}

Although the infiltration of lymphocytes into the lacrimal glands occurs with age, age-related increases in tear production have also been observed in mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this increase remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that increases in tear production were not dependent on body weight gain or systemic conditions, such as insulin resistance, using aged mice and high-fat diet-fed mice. The results obtained also showed that senescence-associated T (SA-T) cells accumulated in the lacrimal glands of aged mice, particularly females. Expression levels of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) in whole lacrimal glands and epithelial cells isolated from lacrimal glands were significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice. The expression levels of adiponectin and one of its receptors, AdipoR2, also increased in the lacrimal glands of aged mice, but not in those of high-fat diet-fed mice. Collectively, the present results indicate that PPARγ and adiponectin-mediated signaling contribute to age-related increases in tear production in mice and have potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of dry eye in humans.</AbstractText>"}

Older adults, even with clinically normal hearing, often have problems understanding speech in noise. Earlier auditory studies using the frequency-following response (FFR), primarily believed to be generated by the midbrain, demonstrated age-related neural deficits when analyzed with traditional measures. Here we use a mutual information paradigm to analyze the FFR to speech (masked by a competing speech signal) by estimating the amount of stimulus information contained in the FFR. Our results show, first, a broadband informational loss associated with aging for both FFR amplitude and phase. Second, this age-related loss of information is more severe in higher-frequency FFR bands (several hundred hertz). Third, the mutual information between the FFR and the stimulus decreases as noise level increases for both age groups. Fourth, older adults benefit neurally, i.e., show a reduction in loss of information, when the speech masker is changed from meaningful (talker speaking a language that they can comprehend, such as English) to meaningless (talker speaking a language that they cannot comprehend, such as Dutch). This benefit is not seen in younger listeners, which suggests that age-related informational loss may be more severe when the speech masker is meaningful than when it is meaningless. In summary, as a method, mutual information analysis can unveil new results that traditional measures may not have enough statistical power to assess.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Older adults, even with clinically normal hearing, often have problems understanding speech in noise.

Gold standard adhesives (Scotchbond Multipurpose Plus and Clearfil SE Bond) were controls. Microtensile dentin bond strength (n=5 teeth), pH, and C=C conversion (n=3) were evaluated. Data were analyzed at α=0.05. All adhesives showed differences in pH. Ybond had intermediately strong aggressiveness, whereas the others were ultra-mild. The C=C conversion was different in most adhesives. In the etch-and-rinse strategy, all adhesives showed similar results generally except for G-Bond, which had lower bond strength than most adhesives. G-Bond and Tetric-N-Bond showed lower bond strengths after 6 months compared with 24 h, whereas the other adhesives had stable dentin bonds. In the self-etch strategy, G-Bond had lower bond strength than most adhesives. After 6 months, Ambar was the only adhesive showing lower dentin bond strength compared with 24 h. Most adhesives had discreet drops in bond strength during aging when used in the self-etch strategy. The failure modes were also material dependent, with a general pattern of increased adhesive and/or pre-testing failures after storage. In conclusion, the bonding performance of universal adhesives to dentin is material dependent. Most adhesives had stable dentin bonds with results comparable to the gold standard materials, particularly when applied in the self-etch mode.

Section B, Aging, neuropsychology and cognition","Date":"Oct 09 2019","Keywords":"Imitation, apraxia, body schema, midline crossing, normal aging","Abstract":"<AbstractText>While imitation of meaningless gestures is a gold standard in the assessment of apraxia in patients with either stroke or neurodegenerative diseases, little is known about potential age-related effects on this measure. A significant body of literature has indicated that different mechanisms (i.e., executive functioning, visuospatial skills, sensory integration, body knowledge, categorical apprehension) may underlie the performance depending on imitation conditions (i.e., finger/hand, uni-/bimanual, symmetric/asymmetric, crossed/uncrossed configurations). However, neither the effects of these conditions on performance, nor the contribution of the abovementioned mechanisms to imitation have been explored in normal aging. The aim of the present study was to fill this gap. To do so, healthy adults (<i>n</i> = 103) aged 50 to 89 were asked to imitate 45 meaningless gestures. The authors controlled for general cognitive function, motor function, visual-spatial skills, executive function, sensory integration, body knowledge, and mechanical problem-solving skills. The results showed that asymmetry, body-midline crossing and, to a lesser extent, bimanual activity added an additional layer of difficulty to imitation tasks. After controlling for motor speed and cognitive function, age had an effect on imitation skills after 70 years old. This may reflect a decline in body knowledge, sensory integration, and executive functions. In contrast, the visuospatial and mechanical problem-solving hypotheses were ruled out. An additional motor simulation hypothesis is proposed. These findings may prove useful for clinicians working in memory clinics by providing insights on how to interpret imitation deficits. Lower performance after 70 years old should not be considered abnormal in a systematic manner.</AbstractText>"}

Caffeine consumption is associated with a lower risk of age-associated neuropathologies, besides several extracts that have antioxidant proprieties are known to be neuroprotective, and oxidative stress strongly correlates with Aβ-toxicity. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i> hydroalcoholic extract (IPHE) and to evaluate if caffeine agent present in IPHE exerts neuroprotective effects in an amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ)-induced toxicity in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans.</i> The wild-type and CL2006 worms were treated with IPHE (2 and 4 mg/mL) or caffeine (200 and 400 μM) since larval stage 1 (L1) until they achieved the required age for each assay. IPHE and caffeine increased the lifespan and appeared to act directly by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger in both wild-type and CL2006 worms, also conferred resistance against oxidative stress in wild-type animals. Furthermore, both treatments delayed Aβ-induced paralysis and decreased AChE activity in CL2006. The protective effect of IPHE against Aβ-induced paralysis was found to be dependent on heat shock factor <i>hsf-1</i> and FOXO-family transcription factor <i>daf-16</i>, which are respectively involved in aging-related processes and chaperone synthesis, while that of caffeine was dependent only on <i>daf-16</i>. Mechanistically, IPHE and caffeine decreased the levels of Aβ mRNA in the CL2006 worms; however, only IPHE induced expression of the heat shock chaperonin <i>hsp-16.2</i>, involved in protein homeostasis. The results were overall better when treated with IPHE than with caffeine.</AbstractText>"}

However, little is known about the biological behaviors of Rig-I devoid of viral infection. Herein, we investigated the roles of Rig-I in the regulation of cellular senescence. In comparison to wild-type counterparts, <i>Rig-I</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed the accelerated loss of hair, less responsiveness to gentle physical stimuli and shorten survival time. Likewise, Rig-I deficiency rendered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) more susceptible to the serial passages-associated replicative senescence. By performing a transcriptome analysis, we identified integrins at the intersections of biological pathways affected by Rig-I. Among these, integrin β3 was negatively regulated by Rig-I, and significantly upregulated with the occurrence of senescence. Gene silencing of Itgb3 (encoding integrin β3) retarded the progression of cellular senescence in both WT and <i>Rig-I</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. Notably, this effect was more prominent in <i>Rig-I</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. Furthermore, p38 MAPK was a key downstream molecule for integrin β3-mediated senescence, and overactivated in senescent <i>Rig-I</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. Taken together, Rig-I deficiency contributes to cellular senescence through amplifying integrin β3/p38 MAPK signaling. Our findings provide the evidence that Rig-I is a key regulator of cellular senescence, which will be helpful in better understanding its function without viral infection.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Rig-I: retinoic acid inducible gene-I; SASP: senescence-associated secretory phenotype; ECM: extracellular matrix; Itgb3: integrin beta 3; PRR: pattern recognition receptor; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; Il-1β: interleukin-1 beta; Il-6: interleukin-6; Il-8: interleukin-8; Cxcl1: chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; Ccl2: chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2; WT, wild type; BM: bone marrow; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinases; JNK: Jun N-terminal kinases; SA-β-gal: senescence-associated β-galactosidase; qPCR: quantitative reverse-transcription PCR; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline.</AbstractText>"}

Another 40 patients (20 young: mean age &lt; 30 years; 20 elderly: mean age &gt; 70 years) were studied in vivo by confocal microscopy. The resulting images were analyzed qualitatively, quantitatively, and statistically. The basic light microscope revealed a decrease in endothelial cell density with age accompanied by an increase in endothelial cell size. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a corneal thinning and a decrease in the number of corneal stromal cells. A marked decrease in stromal nerve fibers was observed in the older subjects compared to the younger ones. Variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM) was used to make surface morphological observations and to determine the chemical composition of in vivo hydrated human corneas.

The impairment of the endogenous healing potential provoked by the aging requires the development of more effective and personalized therapies, based on new biomaterials and devices able to direct the cell fate to stimulate and sustain the regrowth of damaged or diseased tissues. To obtain satisfactory results, also in cases where the cell senescence, typical of the elderly, makes the regeneration process harder and longer, the new solutions have to possess excellent ability to mimic the physiological extracellular environment and thus exert biomimetic stimuli on stem cells. To this purpose, the 'biomimetic concept' is today recognized as elective to fabricate bioactive and bioresorbable devices such as hybrid osteochondral scaffolds and bioactive bone cements closely resembling the natural hard tissues and with enhanced regenerative ability. The review will illustrate some recent results related to these new biomimetic materials developed for application in different districts of the musculoskeletal system, namely bony, osteochondral and periodontal regions, and the spine. Further, it will be shown how new bioactive and superparamagnetic calcium phosphate nanoparticles can give enhanced results in cardiac regeneration and cancer therapy. Since tissue regeneration will be a major demand in the incoming decades, the high potential of biomimetic materials and devices is promising to significantly increase the healing rate and improve the clinical outcomes even in aged patients.</AbstractText>"}

Advanced age is associated with increased frailty among older Americans and often leads to increased disability, hospitalization, institutionalization, and, eventually, mortality. In search of means to improve age-related risks for adverse health outcomes, the question of restoring diminishing sex hormones has gathered much interest and has led to the practice of sex hormone replacement therapies in older men. Recent data suggest that androgen prescription rates in the US for men older than 60 years of age quadrupled from the years 2001 to 2011. While prescription sales of testosterone have increased from $150 million in 2000 to $1.8 billion in 2011, a significant portion of men prescribed testosterone replacement therapy did not meet the laboratory criteria for hypogonadism. While some clinical trials reported an association between testosterone insufficiency in older men and increased risk of death, the exact effects and consequences of testosterone replacement therapy, specifically in older men, remain unclear. This review is aimed at discussing the possible benefits and complications of testosterone replacement therapy in older men over 60 years of age.</AbstractText>"}

Currently, a number of theoretical frameworks are available to researchers when interpreting empirical data. Despite the great progress that has been made, a comprehensive understanding of biological processes that shape ageing is lacking. Senescence is a dynamic, plastic and highly complex metaphenomenon whose aetiology remains unclear. The paucity of information notwithstanding, some researchers promote 'anti-ageing' drugs and formulae every now and again. The rationale behind this concept is that ageing can be reduced to a mixture of biochemical reactions. Furthermore, the distinction between ageing and disease has been questioned on the grounds that ageing is the root of age-related diseases. It has been claimed that disease-oriented approaches can help delay ageing and prevent age-related diseases. Although these methods seem incongruous from an evolutionary standpoint, they become popular amongst the public. Moreover, if ageing is classified as a disease, this situation is likely to be exacerbated. Therefore, it is important to recognise the limitations of these reductionist and disease-oriented approaches. Only holistic and evidence-based strategies might be useful in slowing down ageing and preventing age-related diseases in the future.</AbstractText>"}

Mounting evidence suggests that Aβ and mitochondrial structural and functional abnormalities are critically involved in the loss of synapses and cognitive decline, in patients with AD. In AD brain, state the sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by BACE1 and γ-secretase leads to the production and release of Aβ40 and 42. BACE1 expression and activity increased in the brains of AD patients. Structurally, β-secretase has a very large binding site (1000 Å) with fewer hydrophobic domains that makes a challenge to identify the specific targets/binding sites of BACE1. In the present study, we constructed a BACE1 pharmacophore with pepstatin and screened through molecular docking studies. We found one potential candidate (referred as ligand 1) that binds to the key catalytic residues of BACE1 and predicts to inhibit abnormal APP processing and reduce Aβ levels in AD neurons. Using biochemical, molecular, transmission electron microscopy, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses, we studied the protective effects of ligand 1 against Aβ-induced synaptic and mitochondrial toxicities in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells that express mutant APP. We found interaction between ligand 1 and BACE1 and this interaction decreased BACE1 activity, Aβ40 and 42 levels. We also found increased mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion and synaptic activity and reduced mitochondrial fission in ligand 1-treated mutant APP cells. Based on these results, we cautiously conclude that ligand 1 reduces Aβ-induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities, and maintains mitochondrial dynamics and neuronal function in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

This, coupled with disease-specific guidelines derived from clinical trials in younger people, has led to an increase in exposure to polypharmacy and the associated therapeutic burden. Older people, especially those living with frailty, tend to experience lower efficacy of these medications along with a higher risk of drug adverse effects. Explanations for these differences include the physiological effects of frailty, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and reduced medication adherence. Adverse drug reactions often go unnoticed and can trigger further prescribing. Certain medications have been recognised as potentially inappropriate for people with frailty, yet their use remains common. Evidence suggests that many older people are open to the concept of reducing medications. Deprescribing should be based around a shared decision-making approach. Trials to date have suggested that it can often be achieved without harm. To date, there are few data to support improvements in hospitalisation or mortality rates. However, there is some evidence that it may reduce polypharmacy, improve medication adherence, reduce financial costs and improve quality of life. In the future, it will be necessary to grow the evidence base and improve public and clinician awareness of the potential benefits of deprescribing. It will require excellent team working and communication between all of those involved in the prescribing and administration of medications, also supported by improved healthcare informatics. Non-pharmacological approaches will need to be promoted. Fewer drugs is not less care.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In doing so, they manage an emotional boundary between service members and their families. This study focused on two behaviors military spouses may use when managing this boundary, namely their minimization of (1) their own concerns (i.e., <i>self-directed minimization</i>) and (2) service members' concerns (i.e., <i>partner-directed minimization</i>). The purpose of the current study was to identify correlates and consequences of these behaviors. Findings from a longitudinal structural equation model utilizing three waves of data from a sample of 154 married military couples in which the husband was a male National Guard soldier indicated that spouses were more likely to minimize both their own-and service members'-concerns when they themselves reported higher levels of depressive symptomology prior to deployment. Spouses' minimization of service members' concerns during deployment, in turn, predicted higher levels of service members' depressive symptomology at reintegration, even after accounting for their initial depressive symptomology and combat exposure. Implications for intervention efforts aimed at promoting individual and couple adjustment to deployment are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The goal of this study is to determine whether knocking down CDK5 by a peptide-directed lysosomal degradation approach is therapeutically effective against stroke. We synthesized a membrane-permeable peptide that specifically binds to CDK5 with a chaperone-mediated autophagy targeting motif (Tat-CDK5-CTM) and tested its therapeutic effects on a mouse model of ischemic stroke. Our results showed that Tat-CDK5-CTM blocked the CDK5-NR2B interaction, resulting in the degradation of CDK5, which in turn prevented calcium overload and neuronal death in cultured neurons. Tat-CDK5-CTM also reduced the infarction area and neuronal loss and improved the neurological functions in MCAO (Middle cerebral artery occlusion) mice. The peptide-directed lysosomal degradation of CDK5 is a promising therapeutic intervention for stroke.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Zhou et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Apart from <i>a priori</i> classifications based purely on motor features, cluster analysis studies have achieved little success in receiving widespread adoption. <i>A priori</i> classifications demonstrate that their chosen factors, whether it be age or certain motor symptoms, do have an influence on subtypes. However, the cluster analysis approach is able to integrate these factors and other clinical features to produce subtypes. Differences in inclusion criteria from datasets, in variable selection and in methodology between cluster analysis studies have made it difficult to compare the subtypes. This has impeded such subtypes from clinical applications. This review analysed existing subtypes of Parkinson's disease, and suggested that future research should aim to discover subtypes that are robustly replicable across multiple datasets rather than focussing on one dataset at a time. Hopefully, through clinical applicable subtyping of Parkinson's disease would lead to translation of these subtypes into research and clinical use.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 To? et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Considering that aging is the most significant risk factor for many chronic lung diseases (CLDs), understanding this process may facilitate the development of new interventionist approaches. Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a serious problem in older adults with CLDs, reducing their quality of life and survival. In this study, we reviewed the possible links between handgrip strength (HGS)-a simple, noninvasive, low-cost measure of muscle function-and CLDs in the elderly. Different mechanisms appear to be involved in this association, including systemic inflammation, chronic hypoxemia, physical inactivity, malnutrition, and corticosteroid use. Respiratory and peripheral myopathy, associated with muscle atrophy and a shift in muscle fiber type, also seem to be major etiological contributors to CLDs. Moreover, sarcopenic obesity, which occurs in older adults with CLDs, impairs common inflammatory pathways that can potentiate each other and further accelerate the functional decline of HGS. Our findings support the concept that the systemic effects of CLDs may be determined by HGS, and HGS is a relevant measurement that should be considered in the clinical assessment of the elderly with CLDs. These reasons make HGS a useful practical tool for indirectly evaluating functional status in the elderly. At present, early muscle reconditioning and optimal nutrition appear to be the most effective approaches to reduce the impact of CLDs and low muscle strength on the quality of life of these individuals. Nonetheless, larger in-depth studies are needed to evaluate the link between HGS and CLDs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Lima et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The mechanism of pyroptosis is significantly different from other forms of cell death in its morphological and biochemical features. Pyroptosis is characterized by the activation of two different types of caspase enzymes-caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11, and by the occurrence of a proinflammatory cytokine cascade and an immune response. Pyroptosis participates in the immune defense mechanisms against intracellular bacterial infections. On the other hand, excessive inflammasome activation can induce sterile inflammation and eventually cause some diseases, such as acute or chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis. The mechanism and biological significance of this novel form of cell death in different liver diseases will be evaluated in this review. Specifically, we will focus on the role of pyroptosis in alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as in liver failure. Finally, the therapeutic implications of pyroptosis in liver diseases will be discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Wu et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Previous studies indicated extracts or compounds from Cistanches (ECC) exert a potential neuroprotective effect against AD. Thus, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to assess preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of ECC in experimental AD. A systematical searching strategy was carried out across seven databases from their inceptions to July 2018. Twenty studies with 1696 rats or mice were involved. Neurobehavioral function indices as primary outcome measures were established by the Morris water maze test (n = 11), step-down test (n = 10), electrical Y-maze test (n = 4), step-through test (n = 3), open field test (n = 2) and passage water maze test (n = 1). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed ECC exerted a significant effect in decreasing the escape latency, error times and wrong reaction latency in both the training test and the retention test, and in increasing the exact time and the percentage of time in the platform-quadrant and the number of platform crossings (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). In conclusion, ECC exert potential neuroprotective effects in experimental AD, mainly through mechanisms involving antioxidant stress and antiapoptosic effects, inhibiting Aβ deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation and promoting synapse protection. Thus, ECC could be a candidate for AD treatment and further clinical trials.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Zhou et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Therefore, this study sought to establish whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling does indeed regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged brain.

Here, we applied a small molecule, hydroxyurea (HU), to promote the manifestation of disease relevant phenotypes in iPSCs-based modeling of PD. We established two iPS cell lines derived from two sporadic PD patients. Both patients-iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons did not display PD relevant phenotypes after 6 weeks culture. HU treatment remarkably induced ER stress on patients-iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, HU treatment significantly reduced neurite outgrowth, decreased the expression of p-AKT and its downstream targets (p-4EBP1 and p-ULK1), and increased the expression level of cleaved-Caspase 3 in patients-iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons. The findings of the present study suggest that HU administration could be a convenient and reliable approach to induce disease relevant phenotypes in PD-iPSCs-based models, facilitating to study disease mechanisms and test drug effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Tan et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. Agonistic autoantibodies against angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor (AT1-AAs) have been demonstrated to be pro-inflammatory and contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. However, the association between AT1-AAs and vascular aging has not been defined. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an acknowledged vascular aging-related disease. In this study, AT1-AAs were detected in the sera of patients with PAD and the positive rate was 44.44% (n=63) <i>vs.</i> 17.46% in non-PAD volunteers (n=63). In addition, case-control analysis showed that AT1-AAs level was positively correlated with PAD. To reveal the causal relationship between AT1-AAs and vascular aging, an AT1-AAs-positive rat model was established by active immunization. The carotid pulse wave velocity was higher, and the aortic endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was attenuated significantly in the immunized rats. Morphological staining showed thickening of the aortic wall. Histological examination showed that levels of the senescent markers were increased in the aortic tissue, mostly located at the endothelium. In addition, purified AT1-AAs-IgGs from both the immunized rats and PAD patients induced premature senescence in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These effects were significantly blocked by the AT1 receptor blocker. Taken together, our study demonstrates that AT1-AAs contribute to the progression of vascular aging and induce EC senescence through AT1 receptor. AT1-AA is a novel biomarker of vascular aging and aging-related CVD that acts to accelerate EC senescence.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Wang et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Atorvastatin is an effective drug for treating hyperlipidemia and known to improve neurological outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. Previous studies have reported that atorvastatin treatment promotes hematoma absorption in CSDH, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin mediate absorption of CSDH. 144 male, Wistar rats (6 months old) were randomly divided into the following groups: 1) sham surgery control, 2) treatment: CSDH + atorvastatin, and 3) vehicle control: CSDH + saline. Atorvastatin or saline was orally administered daily for 19 days after CSDH procedure. A T2WI MRI was used to evaluate CSDH volume changes during the time course of the study. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the number of regulatory T cells (Treg). ELISA was used to measure cytokine level in the hematoma border. Neurological function and cognitive outcome were evaluated using Foot-Fault test and Morris Water Maze test, respectively. When compared to saline treatment, atorvastatin treatment accelerated the absorption of CSDH as indicated by decreased hematoma volume in T2WI MRI data on 14<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> day after CSDH (P&lt;0.05). Atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the number of Treg in circulation and hematoma border from 3<sup>rd</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> day after CSDH.

Calcitriol and its analogues temporarily inhibited the formation of metastases in the lungs. Unexpectedly, only mice treated with calcitriol analogues showed a deterioration of bone-related parameters, such as bone column density, marrow column density and the CaPO<sub>4</sub> coefficient. These findings correlated with an increased number of active osteoclasts differentiated from bone marrow-derived macrophages in mice treated with the analogues.

We determined the effect of metformin on locomotor and cognitive function in normoglycemic mice. Metformin enhanced locomotor and balance performance, while induced anxiolytic effect and impaired cognitive function upon chronic treatment. We conducted <i>in vitro</i> assays and metabolomics analysis in mice to evaluate metformin's action on the brain metabolism. Metformin decreased ATP level and activated AMPK pathway in mouse hippocampus. Metformin inhibited oxidative phosphorylation and elevated glycolysis by inhibiting mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) <i>in vitro</i> at therapeutic doses.

Some models have also uncovered the efficacy of new antiepileptic drugs or biologics for alleviating epileptogenesis, cognitive impairments, or spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Nonetheless, the suitability of these models for testing candidate therapeutics in conditions such as chronic TLE is debatable because of a lower frequency of SRS and an inconsistent pattern of SRS activity over days, weeks or months. An ideal prototype of chronic TLE for investigating novel therapeutics would need to display a large number of SRS with a dependable frequency and severity and related co-morbidities. This study presents a new kainic acid (KA) model of chronic TLE generated through induction of status epilepticus (SE) in 6-8 weeks old male F344 rats. A rigorous characterization in the chronic epilepsy period validated that the animal prototype mimicked the most salient features of robust chronic TLE. Animals displayed a constant frequency and intensity of SRS across weeks and months in the 5th and 6th month after SE, as well as cognitive and mood impairments. Moreover, SRS frequency displayed a rhythmic pattern with 24-hour periodicity and a consistently higher number of SRS in the daylight period. Besides, the model showed many neuropathological features of chronic TLE, which include a partial loss of inhibitory interneurons, reduced neurogenesis with persistent aberrant migration of newly born neurons, chronic neuroinflammation typified by hypertrophied astrocytes and rod-shaped microglia, and a significant aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus. This consistent chronic seizure model is ideal for investigating the efficacy of various antiepileptic drugs and biologics as well as understanding multiple pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic epilepsy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Upadhya et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The establishment of immunological memory in the skin is a crucial component of the adaptive immune response. Once naive T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells, a small fraction of them differentiate into precursor memory T cells. These precursor cells ultimately develop into several subsets of memory T cells, including central memory T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells, effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) cells, and tissue resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells. T<sub>RM</sub> cells have a unique transcriptional profile, and their most striking characteristics are their long-term survival (longevity) and low migration in peripheral tissues, including the skin. Under physiological conditions, T<sub>RM</sub> cells that reside in the skin can respond rapidly to pathogenic challenges. However, there is emerging evidence to support the vital role of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the recurrence of chronic inflammatory skin disorders, including psoriasis, vitiligo, and fixed drug eruption, under pathological or uncontrolled conditions. Clarifying and characterizing the mechanisms that are involved in skin T<sub>RM</sub> cells will help provide promising strategies for reducing the frequency and magnitude of skin inflammation recurrence. Here, we discuss recent insights into the generation, homing, retention, and survival of T<sub>RM</sub> cells and share our perspectives on the biological characteristics of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the recurrence of inflammatory skin disorders.</AbstractText>"}

However, allogeneic cell therapy is limited by host patient immunologic competence and inconsistent performance due to cell delivery methods. To address allogeneic cell therapy limitations, this study developed a new allogeneic stem cell sheet using human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) that present low antigenicity (i.e., major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Optimal conditions including cell density, passage number, and culture time were examined to fabricate reliable hUC-MSC sheets. MHC II antigens correlated to alloimmune rejection were barely expressed in hUC-MSC sheets compared to other comparator MSC sheets (hBMSC and hADSC). hUC-MSC sheets easily graft spontaneously onto subcutaneous tissue in immune-deficient mice within 10 minutes of placement. No sutures are required to secure sheets to tissue because sheet extracellular matrix (ECM) actively facilitates cell-target tissue adhesion. At 10 days post-transplantation, hUC-MSC sheets remain on ectopic target tissue sites and exhibit new blood vessel formation. Furthermore, implanted hUC-MSC sheets secrete human HGF continuously to the murine target tissue. hUC-MSC sheets described here should provide new insights for improving allogenic cell-based therapies.</AbstractText>"}

The Community for Successful Ageing (ComSA) program in Singapore focuses on Community Development (CD) initiatives for older people, accounting for BPS theory in its design and content.

The aim of this research was to determine if the ASMRT is suitable to be applied in the elderly and detect spatial memory differences as one age. The ASMRT and other neuropsychological tests were applied in a sample aged between 50and 79 years. Results revealed a decrease in the ASMRT performance by the older group. No gender differences were found. Performance in attention and visuospatial working memory tests revealed some correlations with the ASMRT performance. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 70-79-year-old participants clearly show age-related changes in spatial memory.

However, cultures of 'senescent' cells consist of a mix of cell subtypes (proliferative, senescent, growth-arrested and apoptotic). Determining the proportion of senescent cells is crucial for studying ageing and developing new anti-degenerative therapies. Commonly used markers such as doubling population, senescence-associated β-galactosidase, Ki-67, γH2AX and TUNEL assays capture diverse and overlapping cellular populations and are not purely specific to senescence. A newly developed dynamical systems model follows the transition of an initial culture to senescence tracking population doubling, and the proportion of cells in proliferating, growth-arrested, apoptotic and senescent states. Our model provides a parsimonious description of transitions between these states accruing towards a predominantly senescent population. Using a genetic algorithm, these model parameters are well constrained by an <i>in vitro</i> human primary fibroblast dataset recording five markers at 16 time points. The computational model accurately fits to the data and translates these joint markers into the first complete description of the proportion of cells in different states over the lifetime.

Using a within-subjects experimental manipulation, participants performed TB-PM tasks both when a clock was in constant view and when it was hidden behind a button. Results showed that younger adults performed significantly better than older adults on all TB-PM task types, and checked the clock more often, and more strategically.

The impact on cardiometabolic risk factors is not well established. Methods and Results Publicly available data were analyzed from participants of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial with ≥3% initial weight loss (n=1561) during a 1-year intensive lifestyle intervention and with year 4 follow-up data. Participants who regained (regainers) or maintained (maintainers) weight loss were defined with 5 dichotomized cut points (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of percentage weight loss regained (weight change from years 1-4 as percentage of first year weight loss). Change in cardiometabolic risk factors after initial weight loss was compared in maintainers and regainers, after controlling for demographics, medications, and baseline and year 1 change in body mass index. The effect was assessed separately in participants with &lt;10% and ≥10% initial weight loss, and women and men. Maintainers exhibited significant improvements to the cardiometabolic risk factors assessed compared with regainers. No weight regain cut point maximized risk difference between maintainers and regainers across risk factors or sex/initial weight loss subgroups. For many risk factors, allowing more regain as part of maintenance (increasing cut point) diminished the cardiometabolic benefit among maintainers. Conclusions Maintaining weight loss was better than regain for all risk factors. No single cut point maximized the risk difference between maintainers and regainers. Maintainers who kept off ≥75% of weight lost had the greatest benefit. These findings emphasize the importance of intervention programs focusing not only on weight loss but weight loss maintenance, given the adverse consequences of the latter.

This indicates that improvement in RT in SIVCI can in fact mask an abnormally high degree of IIV. Because IIV appears more related to disease, function, and health than RT, its status and potential for change may represent a particularly meaningful, and relevant, disease characteristic of SIVCI. Finally, a high level of within-group variation in the above measures was another characteristic of SIVCI, with such processing heterogeneity in patients with ostensibly the same diagnosis, possibly related to individual variation in pathological load. Detailed measurement of RT, IIV, errors, and practice effects therefore reveal a degree of functional impairment in brain processing not apparent by measuring RT in isolation.</AbstractText>"}

However, the actual composition of oral bacteria communities in patients with AD and whether these oral bacteria are associated with disease severity remain largely unknown. Also, the APOEɛ4 polymorphism is a strong risk factor for sporadic AD, and it would be pertinent to see if the bacterial flora was different in those patients who were APOEɛ4 positive. A total of 78 subjects were recruited in this study, including 39 patients with AD and 39 healthy controls. Saliva was collected from each subject. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing was conducted to analyze the salivary microbiota, and Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze the APOE genotype. There was a significantly lower richness and diversity of saliva microbiota detected in AD patients than healthy controls. The relative abundance of Moraxella, Leptotrichia, and Sphaerochaeta in the saliva of AD patients greatly increased, whereas that of Rothia was significantly reduced. Compared with APOEɛ4 (-) patients, the level of Abiotrophia and Desulfomicrobium was comparatively abundant, while Actinobacillus and Actinomyces decreased significantly in patients carrying the APOEɛ4. No bacteria were found to be associated with the severity of AD. This is the first study to analyze the salivary microorganisms in patients with AD, and we discovered that the composition of salivary microbiome was altered in AD, providing further support for the role of the oral microbiome in AD development.</AbstractText>"}

The needs for a timely diagnosis are now widely acknowledged since person-centered care helps to preserve life quality and prevent crises. One powerful barrier to detection in primary care is the lack of an easy-to-follow stepwise approach, grounded in evidence and consistent with high-quality specialty practice. To help fill this gap, the current European Joint Action proposes a graduated diagnosis strategy tailored to the patients' needs and wills, clarifying appropriate components for primary and specialty care. This strategy considers a first evaluation in primary care that may detect a neurocognitive disorder, that would lead to a second evaluation step allowing etiological diagnosis hypotheses performed mostly by the specialist. A third evaluation stage considering some biological, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging complementary techniques would be proposed to atypical cases or patients willing to consider access to research.</AbstractText>"}

We have found that chronic systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) induces the accumulation of Aβ in the brain of middle-aged mice. On the other hand, recent research has shown that circulating Aβ is transferred into the brain; however, the involvement of chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection in the peripheral Aβ metabolism is unknown. We hypothesized that chronic P. gingivalis infection expands Aβ pools in peripheral inflammatory tissues and thereby contributes to the accumulation of Aβ in the brain of patients with periodontitis. We showed that the increased expression of IL-1β, AβPP770, CatB, Aβ1-42, and Aβ3-42 was mainly co-localized with macrophages in the liver of P. gingivalis infected mice. Blocking CatB and NF-κB significantly inhibited the P. gingivalis-induced expression of IL-1β, AβPP770, Aβ1-42, and Aβ3-42 in RAW264.7 cells. Aβ3-42, but not Aβ1-42, induced the significant death of macrophages, and the reduction of phagocytic abilities induced by Aβ3-42 tended to be higher than that induced by Aβ1-42. Additionally, the expression of AβPP770, CatB, Aβ1-42, and Aβ3-42 was determined in the macrophages of gingival tissues from periodontitis patients. These findings indicate that chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection induces the Aβ accumulation in inflammatory monocytes/macrophages via the activation of CatB/NF-κB signaling, thus suggesting monocytes/macrophages serve as a circulating pool of Aβ in patients with periodontitis. Taken together, CatB may be a novel therapeutic target for preventing the periodontitis-related AD initiation and pathological progression.</AbstractText>"}

Water-use and -conservation strategies in leaves from hot and dry ecosystems are well documented, yet little is known about mechanisms of water allocation in flowers, particularly in tropical savanna ecosystems. We evaluated traits related to corolla water status in two Kielmeyera species that differ in flowering phenology and flower size: larger-flowered K. regalis blooms during the rainy summer and smaller-flowered K. coriacea blooms during the dry winter. To test the hypothesis that water demand in corollas increases with increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD), we analyzed interspecific differences in corolla stomatal conductance and density, water content, and fresh and dry mass per unit area. We also performed hand-pollination and pollinator-exclusion experiments to determine variation in floral longevity. Corolla transpiration rates were higher in K. coriacea (157 vs 95 g·H<sub>2</sub>O·m<sup>-2</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup> for K. coriacea and K. regalis, respectively), and increased with VPD in both species. Stomatal density was 25-fold higher in K. coriacea, and corolla fresh and dry mass per unit of area were 47% and 21% higher, respectively, in K. coriacea, due to thick pectin-rich cell walls. The high pectin content increases water content in corollas of K. coriacea. Regardless of pollination, flowers lasted one day in K. coriacea and three in K. regalis. Our study suggests structure-function relationships of floral traits with flowering season, and that K. coriacea displays small and short-lived corollas with high water content to buffer the high evaporative demand during the dry period.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Most patients are older than 60 years, and in this group only 5-15% of cases survive over 5 years. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more effective targeted therapies. Inactivation of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) is a recurrent event in AML, and overexpression of its endogenous inhibitor SET is detected in ~30% of patients. The PP2A activating drug FTY720 has potent anti-leukemic effects; nevertheless, FTY720 induces cardiotoxicity at the anti-neoplastic dose. Here, we have developed a series of non-phosphorylable FTY720 analogues as a new therapeutic strategy for AML. Our results show that the lead compound CM-1231 re-activates PP2A by targeting SET-PP2A interaction, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Notably, CM-1231 did not induce cardiac toxicity, unlike FTY720, in zebrafish models, and reduced the invasion and aggressiveness of AML cells more than FTY720 in zebrafish xenograft models. In conclusion, CM-1231 is safer and more effective than FTY720; therefore, this compound could represent a novel and promising approach for treating AML patients with SET overexpression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cortical areas involved in face recognition exhibit lower dopamine (DA) receptor availability and lower blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal during task performance with advancing adult age. We hypothesized that changes in the relationship between these two neural systems are related to age differences in face-recognition ability. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure D1 receptor binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) and BOLD signal during face-recognition performance. Twenty younger and 20 older participants performed a face-recognition task during fMRI scanning. Face recognition accuracy was lower in older than in younger adults, as were D1 BP<sub>ND</sub> and BOLD signal across the brain. Using linear regression, significant relationships between DA and BOLD were found in both age-groups in face-processing regions. Interestingly, although the relationship was positive in younger adults, it was negative in older adults (i.e., as D1 BP<sub>ND</sub> decreased, BOLD signal increased). Ratios of BOLD:D1 BP<sub>ND</sub> were calculated and relationships to face-recognition performance were tested. Multiple linear regression revealed a significant Group × BOLD:D1 BP<sub>ND</sub> Ratio interaction. These results suggest that, in the healthy system, synchrony between neurotransmitter (DA) and hemodynamic (BOLD) systems optimizes the level of BOLD activation evoked for a given DA input (i.e., the gain parameter of the DA input-neural activation function), facilitating task performance. In the aged system, however, desynchronization between these brain systems would reduce the gain parameter of this function, adversely impacting task performance and contributing to reduced face recognition in older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Long-term caloric restriction executed at both early and progressive stages of kidney disease was found to exert beneficial effects in rodents. Moreover, some studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of short-term caloric restriction in treating the kidney disease of variable aetiologies possibly by improving mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy process and suppression of inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying these short-term caloric restriction mediated protective effects in rodent models of kidney disease are not completely understood. Importantly, few available evidences have also suggested that carbohydrate restriction can exert beneficial effects in aging and experimentally induced renal injury models, but the mechanisms are not explored yet. Interestingly, the benefits of low protein diet in kidney disease models are extensively reported in literature. However, in most of these studies implementation of the low protein dietary regimen was found to associated with increased high carbohydrate and caloric intake (non-isocaloric). Thus, testing the effects of low protein diet under isocaloric conditions might further help to particularly understand the role of dietary protein content in pathology of kidney disease. Moreover, the direct evidences comparing the efficacy of various dietary restriction regimens in rodent models of kidney diseases are also scarce at present.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis utilises micro-data for 19 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe to compare performance-tested outcomes of mobility and memory with their self-reported equivalents. Relative importance analysis based on multinomial logistic regressions shows that the bias in self-reported health is mostly due to reporting heterogeneities between countries and age groups, whereas gender contributes little to the discrepancy. Concordance of mobility and cognition measures is highly related; however, differences in reporting behaviour due to education and cultural background have a larger impact on self-assessed memory than on self-assessed mobility. Southern as well as Central and Eastern Europeans are much more likely to misreport their physical and cognitive abilities than Northern and Western Europeans. Overall, our results suggest that comparisons of self-reported health between countries and age groups are prone to significant biases, whereas comparisons between genders are credible for most European countries. These findings are crucial given that self-assessed data are often the only information available to researchers and policymakers when asking health-related questions.</AbstractText>"}

In the heart of Cisd2 knockout mice, Cisd2 deficiency causes intercalated disc defects and leads to degeneration of the mitochondria and sarcomeres, thereby impairing its electromechanical functioning. Furthermore, Cisd2 deficiency disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis via dysregulation of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (Serca2a) activity, resulting in an increased level of basal cytosolic Ca2+ and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload in cardiomyocytes. Most strikingly, in Cisd2 transgenic mice, a persistently high level of Cisd2 is sufficient to delay cardiac aging and attenuate age-related structural defects and functional decline. In addition, it results in a younger cardiac transcriptome pattern during old age. Our findings indicate that Cisd2 plays an essential role in cardiac aging and in the heart's electromechanical functioning. They highlight Cisd2 as a novel drug target when developing therapies to delay cardiac aging and ameliorate age-related cardiac dysfunction.</AbstractText>"}

Endocrinology and metabolism","Date":"Dec 01 2019","Keywords":"T2DM, in vivo, obesity, skeletal muscle","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of arginine residues on target proteins and thus alter the stability, localization, or activity of the substrate. In doing so, PRMTs mediate a variety of intracellular functions that are essential for survival. Additionally, PRMT dysregulation is involved in a number of the most prevalent health disorders, including cancer and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, as well as in the aging process. Investigations of PRMT biology in skeletal muscle cells began in 2002, and since then these enzymes have emerged as regulators of skeletal muscle phenotype determination, maintenance, and remodeling. Specifically, more recent in vivo studies have revealed that PRMTs impact multiple aspects of skeletal muscle biology, including satellite cell function and phenotypic plasticity in response to exercise and disuse. Skeletal muscle plays critically important roles in regulating whole body metabolism, and recent investigations have also begun elucidating PRMT expression and function under conditions of metabolic dysfunction. The goals of this review are to <i>1</i>) summarize the literature on PRMT biology in skeletal muscle with a particular emphasis on the in vivo evidence and <i>2</i>) survey PRMTs in metabolic disorders, namely, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Quantitative longitudinal relaxation rate (R<sub>1</sub> ) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps were made at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. R<sub>1</sub> is commonly taken to reflect cortical myelin density. The change in R<sub>1</sub> (ΔR<sub>1</sub> ) was significantly increased in a region of interest (ROI) in the primary motor cortex containing motor outputs to the leg musculature in the exercise group relative to the control group (p = .04). The change in R<sub>1</sub> in this ROI correlated with an increase in oxygen consumption at the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) (p = .04), a marker of improvement in submaximal aerobic performance. An exploratory analysis across the cortex suggested that the correlation was predominately confined to the leg representation in the motor cortex.

Data were from a prospective cohort study of 1545 community-dwelling Mexican Americans aged ≥67 years from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly (1995/1996-2012/2013). Frailty was defined as meeting 2 or more of the following: unintentional weight loss of &gt;10 pounds, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, and slowness. The independent predictor was self-reported pain. Covariates included age, sex, marital status, education, comorbid conditions, body mass index, Mini-Mental State Examination, depressive symptoms, and limitation in activities of daily livings. General equation estimation was performed to estimate the odds ratio of frailty as a function of pain. A total of 538 participants (34.8%) reported pain at baseline. The prevalence of frailty among those with pain ranged from 24.4% in wave 3 to 41% in wave 8. The odds ratio of becoming frail over time as a function of pain was 1.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.41 to 2.09 after controlling for all covariates. Older age, hip fracture, high depressive symptoms, and activities of daily living disability were also associated with higher odds of becoming frail over time. Female participants and those with higher levels of education and high Mini-Mental State Examination scores were less at risk. In conclusion, pain was a significantly predictor of frailty. Early assessment and better management of pain may prevent early onset of frailty in older Mexican Americans.</AbstractText>"}

Optometrists can influence the timing of surgical intervention to mitigate the damage from delaying surgical intervention in patients whose other findings do not meet a surgeon's treatment threshold.Aniseikonia due to optical differences between the eyes occurs in 1 to 3.5% of the population and can hinder the quality of binocular vision. The less noted retinally induced aniseikonia is due to mechanical distortion and displacement of the retinal photoreceptors and occurs with disorders such as epiretinal membrane, reattached retinal detachment, macular hole, and macular edema. Despite that it was first reported in 1950 and its incidence continues to rise in the aging population, many eye care practitioners are unaware of this condition, which can persist or even be exacerbated after treatment as a contributing cause of binocular vision symptoms. The purpose of this report is to allow more eye care practitioners to become familiar with retinally induced aniseikonia.

This critical review of the literature focused on the neuropsychological functioning in these ageing athletes, and included 22 articles published between 2013 and 2019, of which 13 reported on neuroradiological imaging and four focused on dose-response relationships of repetitive head injury on cognitive outcomes. Four studies suggest higher prevalence of MCI and neurodegenerative disease among NFL retirees, although a quantifiable risk and prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in these players remains unknown. Decreased verbal memory has been found in some players across multiple studies, though with unknown clinical significance due to small sample sizes, unreported effect sizes, and absence of longitudinal data. Studies investigating a dose-response relationship between cognitive decline and head injury have generated mixed findings utilizing various measures of head injury exposure. Neuroradiological findings are inconsistent, but suggest that some NFL players may be at greater risk for reduced white matter integrity.

Because of these biochemical properties, the methionine residue plays a central role in a variety of biological processes, such as metal coordination, antioxidant stress, and aging. However, studies on the molecular functions of methionine are much less common than the other primary sulfur-containing amino acid, cysteine. The limited number of publications on methionine-related studies is partially due to the lack of tools for methionine modification. Methionine bioconjugation offers a new strategy to decipher the biological function of methionine and expands the toolbox for protein functionalization in the context of the application, such as synthesizing proteins with novel properties and producing new biomaterials.

We describe the case of a 31-year-old man referred for primary infertility. Gonadotropins were undetectably low, but testosterone and estradiol were in the high-normal range. Semen analysis showed oligoasthenospermia. He denied using exogenous testosterone. Scrotal ultrasound showed microlithiasis and millimetric hypolucent lesions in the left testis but no intratesticular mass. Human chorionic gonadotropin was low. To investigate unilateral hormone secretion, selective testicular venous sampling was performed. Testosterone and estradiol were clearly higher on the left side than on the right (130 vs 26 nmol/L and 1388 vs 62 pmol/L, respectively), with a left spermatic vein-to-periphery gradient of 4.3 for testosterone and 13 for estradiol; there were no similar gradients on the right side. This finding confirms that all sex steroid secretion came from the left testis. The patient was therefore referred for left orchidectomy. Histopathology revealed multifocal seminoma, germ cell neoplasia <i>in situ,</i> and Leydig cell hyperplasia but no choriocarcinoma. However, gonadotrophin levels increased after orchidectomy, indicating that the source of gonadotropin-independent sex steroid secretion was removed. Testosterone and estradiol decreased to the mid-normal range. Sperm concentration improved. This report thus shows that endogenous testosterone secretion in one testicle supports spermatogenesis without measurable levels of gonadotropins. Selective testicular venous sampling is useful to identify the site of unilateral secretion when the clinical picture is inconclusive. However, histopathology could not reveal the factor that stimulated Leydig cell steroidogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing fatty acid oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Most of these diseases are characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins and a progressive cognitive decline. Among these diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the most common types of degenerative dementia.

Kyotango, one of the longevity areas with various centenarians, is a provincial city located in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture in Japan. To understand the relationship between gut microbiota and urbanization, we compared the diversity, abundance, and function of gut microbiota in older healthy subjects between Kyotango and Kyoto cities; Kyoto is an urban city located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture. In total, 51 subjects at Kyotango and 51 subjects at Kyoto matched by age and gender were recruited, and their fecal samples were obtained to analyze the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis for β-diversity revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota between two cities. In contrast, the analysis of α-diversity revealed no significant differences between the groups. On comparison at the phylum levels, the abundance of Firmicutes was decreased with the urbanization, whereas that of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased. On comparison at the genus levels, with urbanization, a significant decrease was observed in Lachnospiraceae families including genus <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Coprococcus</i>, and significant increases was observed in <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Oscillospira</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>. The most markedly increased functional pathway with urbanization was lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and decreased pathway was transporters and ABC transporters. In conclusion, the present findings indicate significant differences in the gut microbiota between the provincial city and urban cities at Kyoto Prefecture. These alterations in the microbiota may provide new insights to consider the relationship between longevity and gut microbiota.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 JCBNCopyright © 2019 JCBN.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is the most visible and the widest exposed organ and by far reflects the general health condition and the aging process in humans. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to this complex biological process of skin aging. In recent times, skin health and its beauty is perceived as an indicator of one's health which has resulted in an increasing demand for anti-aging products. Exposure to UV radiation is considered to be one of the factors responsible for aging termed as photoaging. In this review, we have discussed the various factors which may accelerate the process of skin aging. Various approaches and strategies to delay the process of skin aging have been emphasized upon. The patents filed in the area of anti-aging and sunscreen products have also been reviewed to gain an insight into the new formulations which have been developed as an anti-aging product. There has been a tremendous rise in the cosmetic and cosmeceuticals market with products having a dual activity of anti-aging and sun protection. Research is constantly on the rise to ensure the safety of these products. Alternatives to the current topical application of sunscreen are being considered to overcome the drawback of reapplication of the sunscreen often which can be a boon to the cosmeceutical market.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author (s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although the renal prognosis of the disease has been improving in recent years because of the clinical implementation of strict glucose, blood pressure, and lipid controls, some diabetes patients continue to exhibit treatment-resistant macroalbuminuria leading to end-stage kidney disease. Furthermore, renal function decline without macroalbuminuria in diabetes is an emerging issue in Japan, which might be partly due to aging. Thus, a novel therapeutic strategy is needed to further improve renal outcome in diabetes patients. We have recently reported the involvement of dysregulation of intracellular nutrient-sensing signals and the related cellular process, autophagy, in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and abnormal insulin secretion pattern in type 2 diabetes.

Global open","Date":"Aug 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Aging is a dynamic process that can be modeled and understood tissue by tissue and cell by cell. Numerous authors have helped us understand the anatomy of facial fat compartments and the effects of aging on our facial tissues such as skin, fat, bone and fibrous ligaments. Injectable tissue replacement and regeneration (ITR2) is a method to replace decayed tissues of the face using 'like tissues' in an effort to delay or slow the rate of tissue decay seen in facial aging. Facial topography and proportion analysis are performed to diagnose individual-specific losses of facial fat. The degree of sun damage and skin thinning is noted as is the degree of loss in the superficial fat compartment. Deep compartment fat loss is evaluated as is pyriform aperture, orbital, mandibular ramus, mandibular body, and chin resorption. From this analysis, a detailed treatment plan is formulated. Using a mechanical device, 3 different fat grafts are created: 2 mm (millifat), 1 mm (microfat), and 500 microns (cell optimized, matrix rich nanofat); anatomic replacement of all areas of tissue loss is carried out. Millifat is used for deep compartment and bone losses, microfat for superficial fat losses above the facial musculature and nanofat is used intradermally and as a biological cream for topical application. The rationale behind this standardized approach is explained and the scientific foundations for the idea are presented. Reduction in tissue decay appears to be a valid observation, but awaits others confirmation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

By feeding of β-1,3-glucans to the annual fish, <i>Nothobranchius guentheri</i>, we detected the survivorship of the fish and estimated the development of age-related biomarkers at different stages. We first showed that administration of β-1,3-glucans was able to prolong the lifespan of the fish (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). We then showed that β-1,3-glucans clearly reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin in the gills and the senescence-associated β-galactosidase in the caudal fins. Moreover, β-1,3-glucans were able to lower the levels of protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the muscles. Finally, β-1,3-glucans could promote the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in the fish, and slow down the increase of P66shc, a critical factor involved in the regulation of intracellular ROS contents. These data together suggest for the first time that β-1,3-glucans can extend the lifespan, delay the onset of age-related biomarkers and exert an antioxidant action of the aged fish, <i>N. guentheri</i>. It also implies that β-1,3-glucans may be potentially useful for health care in the elderly, including extension of the lifespan.</AbstractText>"}

It was demonstrated that most circRNA-AD associations are independent of changes in cognate linear messenger RNA expression or estimated brain cell-type proportions. Evidence was provided for circRNA expression changes occurring early in presymptomatic AD and in autosomal dominant AD. It was also observed that AD-associated circRNAs co-expressed with known AD genes.

Accumulating evidence suggest that degeneration of axons is an early event in the disease, involving destruction programs that are independent of the survival of the cell soma. Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process, is emerging as a mediator of neuronal loss in models of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate activation of necroptosis in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients and in a toxin-based mouse model of the disease. Inhibition of key components of the necroptotic pathway resulted in a significant delay of 6-hydroxydopamine-dependent axonal degeneration of dopaminergic and cortical neurons in vitro. Genetic ablation of necroptosis mediators MLKL and RIPK3, as well as pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 in preclinical models of PD, decreased dopaminergic neuron degeneration, improving motor performance. Together, these findings suggest that axonal degeneration in PD is mediated by the necroptosis machinery, a process here referred to as necroaxoptosis, a druggable pathway to target dopaminergic neuronal loss.</AbstractText>"}

It is well known that DBC1 regulates its targets, including SIRT1, by protein-protein interaction. However, little is known about how DBC1 biological activity is regulated. In this work, we show that in quiescent cells DBC1 is proteolytically cleaved, producing a protein (DN-DBC1) that misses the S1-like domain and no longer binds to SIRT1. DN-DBC1 is also found in vivo in mouse and human tissues. Interestingly, DN-DBC1 is cleared once quiescent cells re-enter to the cell cycle. Using a model of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, we found that DN-DBC1 is down-regulated in vivo during regeneration. In fact, WT mice show a decrease in SIRT1 activity during liver regeneration, coincidentally with DN-DBC1 downregulation and the appearance of full length DBC1. This effect on SIRT1 activity was not observed in DBC1 KO mice. Finally, we found that DBC1 KO mice have altered cell cycle progression and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, suggesting that DBC1/DN-DBC1 transitions play a role in normal cell cycle progression in vivo after cells leave quiescence. We propose that quiescent cells express DN-DBC1, which either replaces or coexist with the full-length protein, and that restoring of DBC1 is required for normal cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. Our results describe for the first time in vivo a naturally occurring form of DBC1, which does not bind SIRT1 and is dynamically regulated, thus contributing to redefine the knowledge about its function.</AbstractText>"}

It was first identified for its growth factor-like properties, being implicated in tissue remodeling, development, inflammation, and protein homeostasis. However, these findings are controversial, and the role of PGRN in liver disease remains unknown. In the current study, we examined the effect of PGRN in two different models of chronic liver disease, methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. To induce long-term expression of PGRN, PGRN-expressing adenovirus was delivered via injection into the tibialis anterior. In the CCl4-induced fibrosis model, PGRN showed protective effects against hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis via inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation. PGRN also decreased lipid accumulation and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and fibrosis in the MCD-induced NASH model. In vitro treatment of primary macrophages and Raw 264.7 cells with conditioned media from hepatocytes pre-treated with PGRN prior to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or palmitate decreased their expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, PGRN suppressed inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression in a cell culture model of hepatocyte injury and primary stellate cell activation. These observations increase our understanding of the role of PGRN in liver injury and suggest PGRN delivery as a potential therapeutic strategy in chronic inflammatory liver disease.</AbstractText>"}

It is unclear whether a smoking-associated DNAm (epigenetic) score has predictive value for ageing-related health outcomes which is independent of contributions from self-reported (phenotypic) smoking measures. Blood DNA methylation levels were measured in 895 adults aged 70 years in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study using the Illumina 450K assay. A DNA methylation score based on 230 CpGs was used as a proxy for smoking exposure. Associations between smoking variables and health outcomes at age 70 were modelled using general linear modelling (ANCOVA) and logistic regression. Additional analyses of smoking with brain MRI measures at age 73 (n = 532) were performed. Smoking-DNAm scores were positively associated with self-reported smoking status (P &lt; 0.001, eta-squared ɳ<sup>2</sup> = 0.63) and smoking pack years (r = 0.69, P &lt; 0.001). Higher smoking DNAm scores were associated with variables related to poorer cognitive function, structural brain integrity, physical health, and psychosocial health. Compared with phenotypic smoking, the methylation marker provided stronger associations with all of the cognitive function scores, especially visuospatial ability (P &lt; 0.001, partial eta-squared ɳp<sup>2</sup> = 0.022) and processing speed (P &lt; 0.001, ɳp<sup>2</sup> = 0.030); inflammatory markers (all P &lt; 0.001, ranges from ɳp<sup>2</sup> = 0.021 to 0.030); dietary patterns (healthy diet (P &lt; 0.001, ɳp<sup>2</sup> = 0.052) and traditional diet (P &lt; 0.001, ɳp<sup>2</sup> = 0.032); stroke (P = 0.006, OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12, 1.96); mortality (P &lt; 0.001, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.42, 1.79), and at age 73; with MRI volumetric measures (all P &lt; 0.001, ranges from ɳp<sup>2</sup> = 0.030 to 0.052).

BPH is highly related to sexual hormone metabolism and aging. In particular, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), to which testosterone is modified by 5α-reductase (5AR), has a significant effect on BPH development. DHT binds to an androgen receptor (AR) and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1); then, it induces the proliferation of a prostate cell and expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA). <i>Paecilomyces tenuipes</i> (<i>P. tenuipes</i>) is a mushroom that has been popularized by the artificial cultivation of fruiting bodies based on silkworms by researchers from the Republic of Korea. In a previous study, we identified the effect of PE on PSA mRNA expression in LNCaP cells. This suggests that PE may have an inhibitory effect on androgen signaling. Therefore, we confirmed the expression of androgen signaling-related factors, such as AR, SRC-1, and PSA in LNCaP. Furthermore, we confirmed the androgen signaling inhibitory effect of PE using the testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH rat model. A BPH rat model was established with a four-week treatment of daily subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP, 3 mg/kg) dissolved in corn oil after castration. The rats in the treatment group were orally gavaged <i>P. tenuipes</i> extract (PE), finasteride (Fi), or saw palmetto extract (Saw) with TP injection. DHT induced an increase in the expression levels of AR, SRC-1, and PSA proteins in LNCaP cells. On the contrary, the PE treatment reduced the expression levels.

In addition, the protein expressions of AR, 5AR2, and PSA were significantly lower in the PE gavaged group than BPH group in prostate tissue.

The diagnosis of dementia of each included patient was performed using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. In order to evaluate the oral health condition of the included subjects, each patient underwent a physical examination of the oral cavity, during which different clinical parameters were analyzed (number of remaining teeth, oral mucosa, periodontal tissues, bone crests). To each parameter, a score was assigned. Spearman's Rho test was used. <i>Results</i>: Regarding the prevalence of oral pathology in elderly suffering from dementia, it emerged that 20.58% of the included patients had mucosal lesions and/or new mucosal formations (in most cases undiagnosed and therefore untreated). The prevalence of periodontal disease was equal to 82.35% and a marked clinically detectable reabsorption of bone crests was found in almost all patients (88.23%). 24.13% of patients, who underwent the oral examination, had totally edentulous maxillae and/or with retained roots, without prosthetic rehabilitations. The correlation index r showed the presence of a linear correlation (inverse relationship) between the degree of dementia and the state of health of the oral cavity of each patient. <i>Conclusions</i>: Several factors contribute to poor oral health in the elderly suffering from dementia: cognitive functions deterioration, behavioral disorders and inadequate medical-staff nursing training on oral hygiene. This study also demonstrated that the lower the dementia degree is, the lower tends to be the oral health status.

Typical histopathological features associated with aging, such as valvular lesions, endomyocardical hyperplasia, or papillary muscle calcification, were found at a low extent in all the experimental groups. The most relevant finding was that inflammation registered by fish oil group was lower compared to the other treatments. At the ultrastructural level, heart mitochondrial area, perimeter, and aspect ratio were higher in fish oil-fed rats than in those fed on sunflower oil. Concerning oxidative stress markers, there were differences only in coenzyme Q levels and catalase activity, lower in sunflower oil-fed animals compared with those fed on fish oil.

EAAT2 expression is reduced in aging and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains. The role EAAT2 plays in cognitive aging and its associated mechanisms remains largely unknown. Here, we show that conditional deletion of astrocytic and neuronal EAAT2 results in age-related cognitive deficits. Astrocytic, but not neuronal EAAT2, deletion leads to early deficits in short-term memory and in spatial reference learning and long-term memory. Neuronal EAAT2 loss results in late-onset spatial reference long-term memory deficit. Neuronal EAAT2 deletion leads to dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway, and astrocytic EAAT2 deficiency results in dysfunction of innate and adaptive immune pathways, which correlate with cognitive decline. Astrocytic EAAT2 deficiency also shows transcriptomic overlaps with human aging and AD. Overall, the present study shows that in addition to the widely recognized astrocytic EAAT2, neuronal EAAT2 plays a role in hippocampus-dependent memory. Furthermore, the gene expression profiles associated with astrocytic and neuronal EAAT2 deletion are substantially different, with the former associated with inflammation and synaptic function similar to changes observed in human AD and gene expression changes associated with inflammation similar to the aging human brain.</AbstractText>"}

While several neurodegenerative diseases can affect frontal function, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has particularly serious and specific effects, which thus provide insights into the role of frontal circuits in homeostasis and adaptive behavior. FTD represents a collection of disorders with specific clinical-pathologic correlates, imaging, and genetics. Patients with FTD and initial prefrontal degeneration often present with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as loss of social decorum, new obsessions, or lack of empathy. In those patients with early anterior temporal degeneration, language (particularly in patients with left-predominant disease) and socioemotional changes (particularly in patients with right-predominant disease) precede eventual frontal dysregulation. Herein, we review a brief history of FTD, initial clinical descriptions, and the evolution of nomenclature. Next, we consider clinical features, neuropathology, imaging, and genetics in FTD-spectrum disorders in relation to the integrity of frontal circuits. In particular, we focus our discussion on behavioral variant FTD given its profound impact on cortical and subcortical frontal structures. This review highlights the clinical heterogeneity of behavioral phenotypes as well as the clinical-anatomic convergence of varying proteinopathies at the neuronal, regional, and network level. Recent neuroimaging and modeling approaches in FTD reveal varying network dysfunction centered on frontal-insular cortices, which underscores the role of the human frontal lobes in complex behaviors.

This chapter summarizes some of the most prominent cognitive changes associated with age-related alterations in the anatomy and physiology of the PFC. Specifically, aging of the PFC results in deficient aspects of cognitive control, including sustained attention, selective attention, inhibitory control, working memory, and multitasking abilities. Yet, not all cognitive functions associated with the PFC exhibit age-related declines, such as arithmetic, comprehension, emotion perception, and emotional control. Moreover, not all older adults exhibit declines in cognition. Multiple life-course and lifestyle factors, as well as genetics, play a role in the trajectory of cognitive performance across the life span. Thus many adults retain cognitive function well into advanced age. Moreover, the brain remains plastic throughout life and there is increasing evidence that most age-related declines in cognition can be remediated by various methods such as physical exercise, cognitive training, or noninvasive brain stimulation. Overall, because cognitive aging is associated with numerous life-course and lifestyle factors, successful aging likely begins in early life, while maintaining cognition or remediating declines is a life-long process.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by binding to their selective messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby leading to either mRNA degradation or translational repression, depending on the degree of complementarity with target mRNA sequences. Aberrant expression of these miRNAs has been linked etiologically with various human diseases including breast cancer. Different cellular pathways of breast cancer development such as cell proliferation, apoptotic response, metastasis, cancer recurrence and chemoresistance are regulated by either the oncogenic miRNA (oncomiR) or tumor suppressor miRNA (tsmiR). In this review, we highlight the current state of research into miRNA involved in breast cancer, with particular attention to articles published between the years 2000 to 2019, using detailed searches of the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The post-transcriptional gene regulatory roles of various dysregulated miRNAs in breast cancer and their potential as therapeutic targets are also discussed.</AbstractText>"}

They are also a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proapoptotic factors. The role of mitochondria has been established in many aspects of cell physiology/pathophysiology, including cell signaling. Mitochondria may deteriorate under various pathological conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Mitochondrial injury can be one of the main causes for cardiac and other tissue injuries by energy stress and overproduction of toxic reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress, elevated calcium and apoptotic and necrotic cell death. However, the interplay among these processes in normal and pathological conditions is still poorly understood. Mitochondria play a critical role in cardiac IR injury, where they are directly involved in several pathophysiological mechanisms. We also discuss the role of mitochondria in the context of mitochondrial dynamics, specializations and heterogeneity. Also, we wanted to stress the existence of morphologically and functionally different mitochondrial subpopulations in the heart that may have different sensitivities to diseases and IR injury. Therefore, various cardioprotective interventions that modulate mitochondrial stability, dynamics and turnover, including various pharmacologic agents, specific mitochondrial antioxidants and uncouplers, and ischemic preconditioning can be considered as the main strategies to protect mitochondrial and cardiovascular function and thus enhance longevity.</AbstractText>"}

In addition, S4 also reduced ultraviolet (UV)B-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally, S4 inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) overexpression. Furthermore, S4 also inhibited UVB-induced Smad7 protein expression and elevated total collagen content in human dermal fibroblasts.

Although several previous studies have reported that this flavonol has diverse health-promoting effects, evidence is still lacking for the underlying molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer efficacy. In this study, we examined the anti-proliferative effect of isorhamnetin on human bladder cancer cells and found that isorhamnetin triggered the gap 2/ mitosis (G2/M) phase cell arrest and apoptosis. Our data showed that isorhamnetin decreased the expression of Wee1 and cyclin B1, but increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, and increased p21 was bound to Cdk1. In addition, isorhamnetin-induced apoptosis was associated with the increased expression of the Fas/Fas ligand, reduced ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) expression, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases. Moreover, isorhamnetin inactivated the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway by diminishing the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, isorhamnetin stimulated production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the interruption of ROS generation using a ROS scavenger led to an escape from isorhamnetin-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, this is the first report to show that isorhamnetin inhibited the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells by ROS-dependent arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis. Therefore, our results provide an important basis for the interpretation of the anti-cancer mechanism of isorhamnetin in bladder cancer cells and support the rationale for the need to evaluate more precise molecular mechanisms and in vivo anti-cancer properties.</AbstractText>"}

The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

As such, under normal conditions the antioxidant machinery in the RPE cell is one of the most efficient in the entire body. However, antioxidant defense mechanisms are often impacted negatively by the process of aging and/or degenerative disease leaving RPE susceptible to damage which contributes to retinal dysfunction. Thus, understanding better the mechanisms governing antioxidant responses in RPE is critically important. Here, we evaluated the role of the redox sensitive microRNA miR-144 in regulation of antioxidant signaling in human and mouse RPE. In cultured human RPE, miR-144-3p and miR-144-5p expression was upregulated in response to pro-oxidant stimuli. Likewise, overexpression of miR-144-3p and -5p using targeted miR mimics was associated with reduced expression of Nrf2 and downstream antioxidant target genes (NQO1 and GCLC), reduced levels of glutathione and increased RPE cell death. Alternately, some protection was conferred against the above when miR-144-3p and miR-144-5p expression was suppressed using antagomirs. Expression analyses revealed a higher conservation of miR-144-3p expression across species and additionally, the presence of two potential Nrf2 binding sites in the 3p sequence compared to only one in the 5p sequence. Thus, we evaluated the impact of miR-144-3p expression in the retinas of mice in which a robust pro-oxidant environment was generated using sodium iodate (SI). Subretinal injection of miR-144-3p antagomir in SI mice preserved retinal integrity and function, decreased oxidative stress, limited apoptosis and enhanced antioxidant gene expression. Collectively, the present work establishes miR-144 as a potential target for preventing and treating degenerative retinal diseases in which oxidative stress is paramount and RPE is prominently affected (e.g., age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy).</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Controlling for covariates, all five air pollutants modeled individually were significantly associated with risk of COPD. Modeled jointly, only sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) remained significantly associated with COPD (HR = 1.038, 95% CI = 1.010-1.067), although the five pollutants were highly correlated (r = 0.89). None of the pollutants were significantly associated with adult onset asthma. Cohort-specific analyses indicated that COPD risk was significantly associated with SO<sub>2</sub> exposure for younger (HR = 1.021, CI = 1.001-1.047), middle-age (HR = 1.019, CI = 1.004-1.034) and older cohorts (HR = 1.025, CI = 1.004-1.047).</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Multiple exposure sources and pollutants contributed to COPD risk, including electricity generation and mining but extending to many industrial processes.

In the early days, the focus was merely on the measuring and reporting of drug concentrations. Later, these concentrations were considered in light of target concentrations that are related to clinical response. This did not only allow passively predicting a patient's future response, but it also triggered physicians and pharmacists to actively use the information to optimize the drug dosage to induce and maintain clinical response in the future. While reactive TDM, testing at time of loss of response, is widely accepted in practice especially for the anti-TNF antibodies, there is less data for the other monoclonal antibodies belonging to other classes. Besides reactive testing, there is a movement towards proactively adjusting biologic dosing to prevent loss of response in keeping with the tight control philosophy of IBD care.

The goal of this study was to develop a small incision to help minimize DBUN injury. Ten cadaveric upper limbs were used to measure the anatomic parameters of the DBUN. Based on these measured anatomical relationships, a 20 mm longitudinal incision with the ulnar styloid process as the midpoint was designed to explore and protect the DBUN. Three additional cadaveric upper limbs were used to test the feasibility of this method. Then this method was applied in 15 patients with TFCC injury (IB type). In 10 cadavers, the DBUN was located volar to the ulnar styloid process. The mean linear distance between the DBUN and the ulnar styloid process was 8.04 mm (range: 7.02-8.82mm) in the transverse-volar direction and 13.78 mm (range: 11.06-16.02mm) in the longitudinal-distal volar direction. In three additional cadavers, the DBUN was successfully explored and retracted with this incision, creating a safer space for passing sutures and tying knots. This modified method was used successfully in 15 patients, and the DBUN was protected during surgery. There were no complications, and most importantly, no injuries to the DBUN at the 6-month follow-up visit. Therefore, we recommend that a 20 mm longitudinal incision with the ulnar styloid process as the midpoint be made prior to passing sutures during the arthroscopic repair of TFCC tears to avoid injuring the various branches of the DBUN.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 SFCM.

Here, for the convenience of SGN studies such as patch-clamp or single cell RNA-sequence studies, a knock-in mouse (Shh<sup>CreEGFP/+</sup>; Rosa26-Tdtomato<sup>loxp/+</sup>) was generated for the purpose of obtaining fluorescence SGNs. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) and Tuj1 immunohistochemistry staining were performed to verify the hearing function and the morphological characteristics. The results showed that there was no significant difference between shh and wild type mice. In electrophysiological studies, we verified a series of electrophysiological characteristics including the amplitude of sodium and potassium currents and action potential characteristics of shh and wild type mice and no significant differences were found either. From the above, shh mice have the same cell function and morphology as their littermate control wild type mice and could be used as an ideal tool to study the function and characteristics of spiral ganglion neurons. Potassium channels of SGNs play an important role in resolving time accuracy. We obtained similar amplitude of I<sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup> in neonatal and mature mice in the aging competition experiment, however, the density of I<sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup> from mature mice were significantly different from those of neonatal mice, a phenomenon that may play a key role in the nervous system. Potassium channels have been shown to contribute to apoptosis induced by cisplatin administration in various cell lines. Here we used cisplatin administration to study the ototoxicity and found that the effects of a low dose of cisplatin (0.5 mM correspond to therapeutic doses) causes a decrease in currents and is reversible after a short administration time. Moreover, we propose the activated state of potassium channels has changed but the characteristic and number remain still after cisplatin administration. The excess potassium ions may accumulate in the cell body, which had affected the firing properties and induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis. We suggest that the electrophysiological properties of acutely isolated SGNs may support further research on the mechanics of auditory propagation and ion channel pharmacology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

By using lectin microarray, we demonstrated that the placental membrane N-glycome contains several N-glycan groups: high mannose, asialylated and sialylated biantennary moieties, bisected, core fucosylated, fucosylated at other positions (bearing terminal and/or antennary Fuc), α2-6 and α2-3 sialylated structures. Employing MALDI-TOF MS enabled identification of over sixty different N-glycan structures in all samples, with 17 moieties exceeding the relative abundance of 2%. The major MS peaks originated from: 1) biantennary complex type N-glycan with a bisecting GlcNAc residue and 2) a core Fuc paucimannosidic and high mannose type structures M3-M9.

This is from an increased aqueous humour (AH) outflow resistance through the trabecular meshwork (TM). The pathogenic mechanisms leading to the increase in TM outflow resistance are poorly understood but are thought to be from a dysregulation of the TM extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. ECM modification and turnover are crucial in regulating the resistance to aqueous outflow. ECM turnover is influenced by a complex interplay of growth factors such as transforming growth factors (TGFβ) family and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Elevated TGFβ2 levels result in an increase in ECM deposition such as fibronectin leading to increased resistance. Fibronectin is a major component of TM ECM and plays a key role in its maintenance. Thrombospondins (TSP)-1 and -2 are important regulators of the ECM environment. TSP-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of POAG through activation of TGFβ2 within the TM. TSP-2 does not contain the catalytic domain to activate latent TGFβ, but is able to mediate the activities of MMP 2 and 9, thereby influencing ECM turnover. TSP-2 knock out mice show lower IOP levels compared to their wild type counterparts, suggesting the involvement of TSP-2 in the pathogenesis of POAG but its role in the pathogenesis of POAG remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of TSP-2 in trabecular meshwork ECM regulation and hence the pathogenesis of POAG. TSP-1 and TSP-2 expressions in immortalised glaucomatous TM cells (GTM3) and primary human non-glaucomatous (NTM) and glaucomatous cells (GTM) were determined by immunocytochemistry, immuno-blot analysis and qPCR following treatment with TGFβ2 and Dexamethasone. The level of ECM protein fibronectin was determined in TM cells using immuno-blot analysis following treatment with TSP-1 or -2. TM cells secrete TSP-1 and -2 under basal conditions at the protein level and TSP-2 mRNA and protein levels were increased in response to TGFβ2 three days post treatment. Exogenous treatment with TSP-2 up-regulated the expression of fibronectin protein in GTM3 cells, primary NTM and GTM cells. TSP-1 did not affect fibronectin protein levels in GTM3 cells. This suggests that the role of TSP-2 might be distinct from that of TSP-1 in the regulation of the TM cell ECM environment. TSP-2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of POAG and contribute to increased IOP levels by increasing the deposition of fibronectin within the ECM in response to TGFβ2.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Polypharmacy can be appropriate but is problematic when the increased risk of harm from interactions between drugs or between drugs and diseases or the burden of administering and monitoring medicines outweighs plausible benefits. Polypharmacy has a substantial economic impact in service demand and hospitalization as well as a detrimental impact on patients' quality of life. Apart from causing avoidable harm, polypharmacy can also lead to therapeutic failure, with up to 50% of patients who take four or more medications not taking them as prescribed. Guidance is needed to support patients and clinicians in defining and achieving realistic goals of drug treatment, and system change is necessary to aid implementation. This article outlines lessons from two programs that aim to address these challenges: the Scottish polypharmacy guidance on realistic prescribing and the European Union SIMPATHY project.

Their unusually long lifespan predisposes neurons to neurodegenerative disease. We sought to identify physiological mechanisms that delay neuron aging in Caenorhabditis elegans by asking how neuron morphological aging is arrested in the long-lived, alternate organismal state, the dauer diapause. We find that a hormone signaling pathway, the abnormal DAuer Formation (DAF) 12 nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) pathway, functions cell-intrinsically in the dauer diapause to arrest neuron morphological aging, and that same pathway can be cell-autonomously manipulated during normal organismal aging to delay neuron morphological aging. This delayed aging is mediated by suppressing constitutive endocytosis, which alters the subcellular localization of the actin regulator T cell lymphoma Invasion And Metastasis 1 (TIAM-1), thereby decreasing age-dependent neurite growth. Intriguingly, we show that suppressed endocytosis appears to be a general feature of cells in diapause, suggestive that this may be a mechanism to halt the growth and other age-related programs supported by most endosome recycling.</AbstractText>"}

Immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 are thought to facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, thereby maximising gene expression. Because of this potentially costly sacrificial process, we investigated if ubiquitination of NPR1 plays transcriptional roles prior to its proteasomal turnover. Here we show ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event in which initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. Only when polyubiquitination of NPR1 is enhanced by the E4 ligase, UBE4, it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity. Thus, immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, Skelly et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, few and relatively small studies have directly examined these associations. Here we examined correlations among adult age, dopamine D2-like receptor (D2R) availability, and cognition in two cross-sectional studies of healthy human adults. Participants completed a short cognitive test battery and, on a separate day, a PET scan with either the high-affinity D2R tracer [18F]Fallypride (Study 1) or [11C]FLB457 (Study 2). Digit span, a measure of short-term memory maintenance and working memory, was the only cognitive test for which dopamine D2R availability partially mediated the age effect on cognition. In Study 1, age was negatively correlated with digit span. Striatal D2R availability was positively correlated with digit span controlling for age. The age effect on digit span was smaller when controlling for striatal D2R availability. Although other cognitive measures used here have individually been associated with age and D2R availability in prior studies, we found no consistent evidence for significant associations between low D2R availability and low cognitive performance on these measures. These results at best only partially supported the correlative triad of age, dopamine D2R availability, and cognition. While a wealth of other research in human and nonhuman animals demonstrates that dopamine makes critical contributions to cognition, the present studies suggest caution in interpreting PET findings as evidence that dopamine D2R loss is a primary cause of broad age-related declines in fluid cognition.

The results indicated that MR levels affect subsequent changes in Gf, whereas Gf does not affect changes in MR. This suggests that control of MR may be related to the change in a person's cognitive status, making early intervention, starting in young adulthood, a promising approach.

Although many approaches have been developed for exosome isolation from biofluids, most of them have substantial shortcomings including long processing time, inefficiency, high cost, lack of specificity and/or surface marker-dependency. To address these issues, here we report a novel insulator-based dielectrophoretic (iDEP) device predicated on an array of borosilicate micropipettes to rapidly isolate exosomes from conditioned cell culture media and biofluids, such as plasma, serum, and saliva. The device is capable of exosome isolation from small sample volumes of 200 μL within 20 minutes under a relatively low (10 V cm<sup>-1</sup>) direct current (DC). This device is easy to fabricate thus, no cleanroom facility and expensive equipment are needed. Therefore, the iDEP device offers a rapid and cost-effective strategy for exosome isolation from biofluids in timely manner while maintaining the yield and purity.</AbstractText>"}

Strategies to manage frailty have not been previously explored with stakeholders in Poland. This may stem from misperceptions about the nature and malleability of frailty, which has resulted in it being viewed as a lower priority healthcare concern.<b>Objectives:</b> To explore stakeholders' views to determine whether there are effective everyday strategies that they can adopt to reduce, reverse or prevent frailty.<b>Methods:</b> Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with five stakeholder groups (frail/pre-frail and robust older adults, health and social care professionals and family caregivers) in Poland (<i>n</i> = 44). Data was analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis approach.<b>Results:</b> Two themes were developed. The first emphasized both the positive everyday and more effortful strategies used by individuals to counter frailty; these included the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviours, social engagement and shared experiences. Stakeholders perceived that older adults, even frail ones, might benefit from engaging in meaningful activities to build resilience against frailty. The second examined formal interventions delivered by health and social care professionals.

However, many community-living older adults experience limitations in (instrumental) activities of daily living ((I)ADLs), which may result in a need for home-care services. Unfortunately, home-care workers often provide support by taking over tasks, as they are used to doing things for older adults rather than with them, which undermines their possibilities to maintain their self-care capabilities. In contrast, reablement focuses on capabilities and opportunities of older adults, rather than on disease and dependency. Consequently, older adults are stimulated to be as active as possible during daily and physical activities. The 'Stay Active at Home' programme was designed to train home-care workers to apply reablement in practice. To explore the experiences of home-care workers with this programme an exploratory study was conducting in the Netherlands, between April and July, 2017. In total, 20 participants were interviewed: nine nurses (including a district nurse), 10 domestic support workers and the manager of the domestic support workers. The semi-structured interviews focused on the experienced improvements with regard to knowledge, skills, self-efficacy and social support. Furthermore, the most and least appreciated programme components were identified. The study has shown that home-care workers perceived the programme as useful to apply reablement. However, they also need more support with mastering particular skills and dealing with challenging situations. Future implementation of the 'Stay Active at Home' programme can potentially benefit from small adaptions. Furthermore, future research is needed to examine whether the programme leads to more (cost-) effective home care.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Fortunately, in most cases, pregnancy is possible in this case, taking into account the increased genetic risk. However, this later childbirth may become impossible or significantly more difficult if we can detect sterility and infertility, and its genetic cause is revealed. Any procedure that can help to reduce the 'aging' of society, the reproduction rate, must be treated as an important public health issue. It would be particularly important in cases where genetic causes can be detected in the background of female sterility and infertility. Endocrine causes, infections, immunological causes, psychic factors, stress, and weight problems may be among the causes of female infertility in addition to genetic causes and genetic developmental disorders. Infertility can also be caused by iatrogenic factors, previous interventions, and surgery. In this chapter we will discuss the diseases in which genetic factors play a role.</AbstractText>"}

Particularly, it is unknown which plants R. padi can survive and reproduce on after the harvest of crops. The results revealed that the survival, developmental times, longevity, and fecundity of the aphid varied among the 13 Gramineae weeds, with the life-history parameters significantly differing. The virginoparae could survive long-term and reproduce on 11 of the 13 weeds. Gramineae weeds can possibly play a significant role in the buildup of R. padi populations as reservoirs. The virginoparae could survive long term and reproduce on Iris lactea Pall. var. chinensis (Fisch.) Koidz (Liliflorae: Iridaceae), Iris tectorum Maxim. (Liliflorae: Iridaceae), Cyperus rotundus L.

The chance increases even higher for EMSCs, than somatic tissue derived MSCs​, to become a cell drug as the former can be produced in large scale from an unlimited hESC line with easier quality control and less biosafety concern. We have further demonstrated that both human ESCs and EMSCs, after aggregation to form spheroids, can tolerate hypoxic and ambient conditions (AC) for over 4 and 10 days, respectively, without loss of their viability and alteration of their functions. Based on these advantages, we decided to test whether EMSC spheroids, made in large quantity and delivered through a long-term distance at AC, can treat osteoarthritis spontaneously developed in rhesus macaques (<i>M. mulatta</i>) monkeys as well as the allogenic MSCs. <b>Methods:</b> Xenogeneic AC-transported EMSC spheroids or allogenic BMSCs were injected into the articular cavity of both knees of the monkeys at 3 animals per group. Another two macaques were injected the same way with saline as controls. <b>Results:</b> Both EMSCs and BMSCs groups showed significant amelioration indicated by the reduction of swelling joint size and amplification of keen flare angle post-treatment, compared to the control group.

Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been found to alleviate ED caused by cavernous nerve injury (CNI) in rats. However, little is known about whether induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC) have a therapeutic effect on CNI ED. We established an ED model on rats and evaluated the effect of iMSC on it. <b>Methods</b>: Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four groups and received following operation: sham operation (sham group); bilateral CNI and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections (PBS group); bilateral CNI and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation (adMSC group); or bilateral CNI and iMSC injection (iMSC group). After therapy, the cavernous nerve was stimulated by electricity and the intracavernous pressure (IAP)/mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was measured. The endothelial and smooth muscle tissue in the penis was assessed histologically with Masson's trichrome stain. Immunofluorescence/immunohistochemical stains were applied for the detection of nNOS, vWF, eNOS, SMA, Desmin, S100β, and caspase-3. Nude rats CNI ED model was established for the evaluation of iMSC longevity and differentiation capacity. The paracrine factors were assessed by real-time PCR. <b>Results</b>: Transplantation of iMSC significantly restored the IAP/MAP in this CNI ED model and showed long-term effects. It could rescue the expression of vWF, eNOS, SMA, and Desmin, which indicated the alleviation of endothelial and smooth muscle tissues of the penis. iMSC therapy also could increase the expression of nNOS in the cavernosum and S100β in the major pelvic ganglia (MPG) which contributed to the erectile function. Moreover, the level of BAX and caspase-3 were reduced and Bcl-2 was increased, which indicated the anti-apoptosis effects of iMSC. The iMSC showed little transdifferentiation and exerted their function by activating the secretome of the host. <b>Conclusion</b>: Transplantation of iMSC significantly improved ED induced by CNI. The iMSC may exert their effects via paracrine factors and may be a promising therapeutic candidate for treating CNI ED in the future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, it is not necessary that only municipalities can train people effectively or efficiently. In this paper, we initially reviewed the relevant literature and clarified the definitions of concepts like 'program contents' and 'evaluation indicators,' while also planning our own training programs. Later, we developed a program based on the review and examined the results.Methods　The literature of the training program was examined, and the training program was developed based on the result. Four researchers and three public health nurses from a community general support center, in the Otsuchi Town of Iwate Prefecture, developed a training program from June to September 2017. The training program developed was then conducted from October to November 2017. To evaluate the participants' satisfaction with the program, a self-report survey was conducted. To evaluate the outcomes of the program, we measured their degree of comprehension of their community's challenges, before and after the program.Results　The training program was divided into two parts following the literature review. In the first part, the content of the supporters' activities following the program was determined (Type A), and, in the second, the same content was evaluated by the participants within the program (Type B). Type A consisted of various aspects including both concrete knowledge and skills needed to conduct care preventiveactivities after the program. In Type B, there were many aspects-including both lectures and exercises-that aimed to increase the participants' awareness of community challenges, as well as inspection to learn about pioneering activities which helped them consider concrete care preventive activities following the program. In Otsuchi Town, we found it to be imperative for participants to consider how to respond to various situations and accordingly plan the training program for use in Type B. To evaluate the results, 12 participants were analyzed. Participants included two men and ten women, with an average age of 71.4±10.0 years [range: 53-88]. Comprehension levels of community challenges (3.1→4.1, P=0.046), as well as the confidence to actively involve themselves in their own preventive care strategies (3.4→4.0, P=0.035), significantly increased after involvement in the program. However, their confidence to work for community preventive care support groups (3.1→3.5, P=0.227) did not increase significantly.Conclusion　We clarified certain viewpoints, such as the purpose, content, and evaluation indices of community care training programs, by reviewing the relevant literature. Based on the discovered viewpoints, we were then able to obtain certain results through implementing our own training programs, thereby significantly increasing participant comprehension and confidence levels.</AbstractText>"}

In 2011, we launched an action research project in Yabu City, Hyogo Prefecture, to develop effective community-based strategies to prevent frailty in the elderly. We attempted to introduce community-based frailty prevention classes in every administrative district with the help of the senior workforce at Silver Human Resources Centers. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and the applicability to different communities of this strategy, which will be called the 'Yabu model.'Methods　Using PAIREM (Plan, Adoption, Implementation, Reach, Effectiveness, Maintenance) framework, we evaluated the effectiveness and the applicability to different communities of the Yabu model. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a baseline and follow-up survey of residents aged 65 years or older in 2012 (n=7,287, 90.7% response rate) and 2017 (n=8,157, 85.7%), using a mailed self-administered questionnaire.Results　(1) Plan: The idea was to establish a frailty prevention class (60 min/session, once a week) consisting of resistance exercises and nutritional or psychosocial programs (standard course, six months, 20 sessions/course; short course, one and a half months, 6 sessions/course; after the course, residents continued with the activities themselves). We planned to launch three classes in the first year (2014) and then to increase the number of classes by ten each year after the second year. (2) Adoption: Out of 154 administrative districts, 36 (23.4%) held frailty prevention classes between 2014 and 2017. (3) Implementation: The median attendance rate for the standard or short course (number of times each participant attended/number of frailty prevention class sessions held) was 75.0%. (4) Reach: A total of 719 older people participated in the standard or short course. The participation rate in the administrative districts, where each frailty prevention class was held, was 32.8%, while at the city level it was 8.1%. (5) Effectiveness: Propensity score matching after multiple imputations were performed. While the prevalence of frailty in non-participants increased by 13.7% in the five years from 2012 to 2017, it only increased by 6.8% in participants. Compared to non-participants, program participants had a significantly lower prevalence odds ratio of frailty at the time of the follow-up survey (OR=0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.93). (6) Maintenance: After the standard or short course, 25 out of 26 communities (96.2%) continued the frailty prevention activities once a week.Conclusion　The frailty prevention classes were adopted across many districts and lowered the participants' risk of frailty. Moreover, participants continued to engage in frailty prevention activities even after the course. These results indicate the Yabu model's effectiveness and its applicability for a different community.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is difficult to manage heart failure itself in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Methods We herein report the management of heart failure in an elderly patient with severe heart failure due to ATTRwt. We also review the clinical situation in an additional seven patients with cardiac amyloidosis who were administered pimobendan in our hospital. Results We treated a 71-year-old man with refractory heart failure due to ATTRwt. He was expected to be dependent on dobutamine infusion. We administered pimobendan and successfully improved his symptoms and hemodynamic status to allow his discharge from the hospital. An additional retrospective investigation observed that there were eight patients with ATTR amyloidosis who were administered pimobendan. Although all of the patients at the time of administration of pimobendan were NYHA class III or IV with repeated hospitalization for heart failure, pimobendan seemed to be effective for improving symptoms and enabling patients to be discharged and receive outpatient medical care. Furthermore, focusing on the changes in some biomarkers, we found that the brain natriuretic peptide and estimated glomerular filtration rate values improved after the administration of pimobendan in 5 consecutive patients for whom data were available without additional treatment (p=0.018 and 0.051, respectively).

The risk of excessive Zn intake is increased by supplementing food intake with dietary supplements. Ageing affects many cellular processes that predispose individuals to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the prevalence of senile dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and vascular-type dementia increases with age. As such, we investigated the effects of long-term exposure to excess Zn on learning and memory in aged mice. ICR-JCL female mice (aged 26 weeks) were administered 0, 200, or 500 ppm Zn as zinc chloride in drinking water for 30 weeks. After 30-week administration, aged female animals were subjected to Y-maze, novel object recognition, and step-through passive avoidance tests. Chronic exposure to Zn did not inhibit learning and memory in the Y-maze test, but dose-dependently inhibited learning and memory in novel object recognition and step-through passive avoidance tests. These results indicate the potential for chronic Zn exposure to dose-dependently inhibit both long-term and novel object recognition memory. Results of microarray analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression of transthyretin and many olfactory receptors in the hippocampus of Zn-treated mice.</AbstractText>"}

We find that dinucleotides act as potent stimulators of mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro. Our data demonstrate that increased levels of dinucleotides can be used to initiate transcription, leading to an increase in transcription levels from both mitochondrial promoters and other, nonspecific sequence elements in mitochondrial DNA. Efficient RNA turnover by REXO2 is thus required to maintain promoter specificity and proper regulation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the ability to utilize this potential is predicated on identifying molecular targets that reverse the effects of aging in vulnerable regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus. The dynamic post-translational modification O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has emerged as an attractive target for regulating aging-specific synaptic alterations as well as neurodegeneration. While speculation exists about the role of O-GlcNAc in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, its role in physiological brain aging remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that countering age-related decreased O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) expression and O-GlcNAcylation ameliorates cognitive impairments in aged mice. Mimicking an aged condition in young adults by abrogating OGT, using a temporally controlled neuron-specific conditional knockout mouse model, recapitulated cellular and cognitive features of brain aging. Conversely, overexpressing OGT in mature hippocampal neurons using a viral-mediated approach enhanced associative fear memory in young adult mice. Excitingly, in aged mice overexpressing neuronal OGT in the aged hippocampus rescued in part age-related impairments in spatial learning and memory as well as associative fear memory. Our data identify O-GlcNAcylaton as a key molecular mediator promoting cognitive rejuvenation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

NF is a unique pathophysiological model for determining the direct consequences of cell iron dysregulation. We established lines of induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts from two NF patients and one isogenic control obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. NF fibroblasts, neural progenitors, and neurons exhibited the presence of increased cytosolic iron, which was also detectable as: ferritin aggregates, alterations in the iron parameters, oxidative damage, and the onset of a senescence phenotype, particularly severe in the neurons. In this spontaneous senescence model, NF cells had impaired survival and died by ferroptosis. Thus, non-ferritin-bound iron is sufficient per se to cause both cell senescence and ferroptotic cell death in human fibroblasts and neurons.

Delivery of excessive inhalation anesthetics based on minimum alveolar concentration produces greater deep hypnotic times, which may contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study tested the impact on cognitive function of balanced anesthetic using electroencephalographic (EEG) guidance vs usual anesthesia. We studied 88 surgical patients: 45 randomly assigned to balanced anesthetic technique with EEG guidance and 43 to standard treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery-Mild Cognitive Impairment at 3 intervals (preoperatively, 3-5 days postoperatively, and 3-5 months postoperatively). Additionally, 37 age- and sex-matched individuals not undergoing surgery or anesthesia were evaluated at the same intervals. Better outcomes were seen in the intervention group compared with usual care in the short-term/visual memory cognitive domain (P = .02) at 3 to 5 days, but not at 3 to 5 months. Delivery of anesthesia using EEG monitoring systems can reduce cumulative deep hypnotic time without negatively affecting patient physiologic stress, surgical conditions, or cognitive function.

However, recent work has suggested that ageing is only detectable in this organism in the presence of extrinsic stressors, such as the fluorescent proteins and strong light sources typically used to excite them. Here we combine microfluidics with brightfield microscopy to provide evidence of ageing in <i>E. coli</i> in the absence of these stressors. We report (i) that the doubling time of the lineage of cells that consistently inherits the 'maternal old pole' progressively increases with successive rounds of cell division until it reaches an apparent asymptote, and (ii) that the parental cell divides asymmetrically, with the old pole daughter showing a longer doubling time and slower glucose accumulation than the new pole daughter. Notably, these patterns arise without the progressive accumulation or asymmetric partitioning of observable misfolded-protein aggregates, phenomena previously hypothesized to cause the ageing phenotype. Our findings suggest that ageing is part of the naturally occurring ecologically-relevant phenotype of this bacterium and highlight the importance of alternative mechanisms of damage accumulation in this context.

However, Cr is also known to be a metal allergen for some individuals. Metal allergy is a T cell-mediated disease with symptoms of inflammation and swelling that involve inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. Hence, suppressing these inflammation paths by using COX-2 inhibitor might be useful in treating Cr allergy. In this study, mice were used with Cr-induced allergy challenge model. The mice were injected with celecoxib once per day for 7 days one hour after the challenge. Footpad samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and lymphocytes were isolated from popliteal lymph nodes for the flow cytometric analysis. The results show that both prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), a known mediator of inflammation, and cyclooxygenases (COX)-2 have important roles in the development of Cr allergy. Further, COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, was effective in relieving swelling and inflammation in Cr-allergic mice concordant with suppression of IFN-γ production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and T cell accumulation in the lymph nodes. Therefore, the inhibition of COX-2 may be a therapeutic target for Cr allergy, and additional molecules in the PGE<sub>2</sub> signalling pathway may also be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of metal allergy.</AbstractText>"}

Treatment consists mostly of dialysis and kidney transplantation (KTx), and KTx offers advantages for life expectancy and long-term cost reductions compared with dialysis. This study uses the administrative database of the Lombardy Region to analyze the costs of a cohort of patients with ESRD receiving KTx, covering a time period of 24 months before transplant to 12 months after. During 2011, 276 patients underwent kidney transplantation (8.7% preemptive and 91.3% non-preemptive). In the period before transplantation, the main cost driver was dialysis (66.6% for the period from -24 to -12 months and 73.8% for the period from -12 to 0 months), while in the 12 months after KTx, the most relevant cost was surgery. The total cost -24 to -12 months pre-KTx was 35 049.2€; the cost -12 to 0 months was 36 745.9€; and the cost 12 months after KTx was 43 805.8€. Non-preemptive patients showed much higher costs both pre- and post-KTx than preemptive patients. This study highlights how KTx modifies the resource consumption and costs composition of patients with ESRD vs those undergoing dialysis treatment and how KTx may be economically beneficial, especially preemptive intervention.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

We observed that mogroside V can effectively maintain normal oocyte morphology and early embryo development competence after prolonged culture for 24 h. Moreover, mogroside V can markedly reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, alleviate spindle formation and chromosome alignment abnormalities, improve mitochondrial contents, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and the membrane potential (ΔΨm), and reduce early apoptosis in aged oocytes. We examined the molecular changes and found that <i>SIRT1</i> expression was decreased in <i>in vitro</i> aged oocytes but was maintained by exposure to mogroside V.

We systematically analyzed alternative splicing (AS) events and splicing factors in LC and RC. RNA-seq data were used for genome-wide profiling of AS events that could distinguish LC from RC. The Exon Skip splicing pattern was more common in RC, while the Retained Intron pattern was more common in LC. The AS events that were upregulated in RC were enriched for genes in the axon guidance pathway, while those that were upregulated in LC were enriched for genes in immune-related pathways. Prognostic models based on differentially expressed AS events were built, and a prognostic signature based on these AS events performed well for risk stratification in colon cancer patients. A correlation network of differentially expressed AS events and differentially expressed splicing factors was constructed, and <i>RBM25</i> was identified as the hub gene in the network. In conclusion, large differences in AS events may contribute to the phenotypic differences between LC and RC. The differentially expressed AS events reported herein could be used as biomarkers and treatment targets for colon cancer.</AbstractText>"}

The term elderly onset of rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) describes the disease with onset at age over 60. Several observational studies indicated, that proportion of women and men is comparable in EORA. Clinical course of the disease is characterized by sudden onset with general constitutional symptoms, high disease activity and inflammatory parameters. Involvement of large joints is more common, specially shoulder joints. Antibodies typical for RA (rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated peptide) are usually negative. More advanced destructive changes of joints and functional impairment are also characteristic for EORA patients in comparison with younger onset of RA (YORA). In clinical practice the use of methotrexate and biological drugs is less common, and glucocorticosteroids more common in EORA.

It is estimated that by 2050, those criteria will have applied to 84% of them, out of which 65% will have entered an advanced stage. Data current for 2017 put the estimated number of seniors around the world at approx. 962 million, i.e. 13% of the world's population. Population ageing process has already reached its top dynamics in Poland. Both international studies, and our own research experience imply that only an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to the seniors may help fully appreciate overall complexity of this challenge, and consequently offer an adequate platform for mapping out effective therapeutic management. Provision of a scope of wide-ranging, physiotherapeutic regimens for the seniors requires of any attending therapeutic team a specialist body of knowledge, pertinent expertise in geriatrics and physiotherapy, and plenty of hands-on skills. Physiotherapy in geriatrics is a complex, teamwork-based approach targeted at the seniors of appreciably reduced functional capabilities, and/or burdened with concomitant risk factors for a number of diseases, and/or prone to sustaining other adverse incidents (e.g. falls) typical for older age. In physiotherapeutic management offered to the seniors, as opposed to other age groups, by far the most essential issue consists in multiple concomitant diseases and polypragmacy. After a patient has been diagnosed by an attending physician, and his functional capabilities have been assessed by a physiotherapist, the therapeutic team should primarily focus upon securing for him the most essential goals, as identified at the time. Increased life expectancy raises a number of questions and challenges, to be urgently addressed by the medical sciences; the most basic and pragmatic question being - how are physicians, physiotherapists, and other health care professionals presently prepared to deal effectively with the seniors in terms of the actual treatment management, and a scope of physiotherapeutic interventions urgently required?</AbstractText>"}

Although life expectancy still increases there is no similar trend in maintaining quality of life. The number of disabilities due to age is expected to double in 2060. Muscle mass is one of the most important factors of health and nutrition in old age and it constant loss is characteristic for process of ageing. Muscle mass is controlled by number of different factors. The most important of which is balance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Ageing has no influence on muscle protein degradation so for maintaining muscle mass it is better to target muscle protein synthesis. Optimal protein dose in the meal is the minimal amount of protein effecting in maximal anabolic response. Threshold for anabolic response increase with age. This process, named anabolic resistance can be overwhelmed with high amount of protein in diet. Experts in the field of ageing and nutrition recommend 1,2-1,5 g/kg/d protein for the maintaining of muscle mass, 1,2-1,5 g/kg/d for older with additional risk factors, 2,0 g/kg/d for seriously ill and malnourished. Physical training has synergistic influence with diet protein. Physical training improves muscle performance, muscle strength and prevents muscle wasting. Physical training combined with increased amount of protein in diet results with increased muscle mass.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, some wrinkles, rough and fractured surface textures can be observed on the aged mPVC, accompanying with increased hydroxyl groups and aromatic carbon-carbon double bond but decreased carbon hydrogen bond. It was found that single virgin or aged mPVC at low concentration (10 mg/L) had significant inhibition on the growth of C. vulgaris but no inhibition at higher concentration (100, 1,000 mg/L), which can be reasonably explained by the aggregation and precipitation of mPVC at high concentration. The aging of mPVC inhibited the growth of C. vulgaris with the maximum growth inhibition ratio (IR) of 35.26% as compared with that of virgin mPVC (IR = 28.5%). However, the single copper could significantly inhibit the growth of C. vulgaris and the inhibitory effects increased with concentration (0.2, 0.5, 1.0 mg/L). Furthermore, both the single aged mPVC (10 mg/L) and copper (0.5 mg/L) caused serious cell damage, although the concentration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the intracellular malonaldehyde (MDA) increased. In contrast to single treatment, the growth of C. vulgaris can be enhanced by the combined group with copper (0.5 mg/L) and aged mPVC (10 mg/L).</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

For effective interactions with the environment, observers should integrate signals that share a common source, weighted by their reliabilities, and segregate those from separate sources. Observers are thought to accumulate evidence about the world's causal structure over time until a decisional threshold is reached. Combining psychophysics and Bayesian modeling, we investigated how aging affects audiovisual perception of spatial signals. Older and younger adults were comparable in their final localization and common-source judgment responses under both speeded and unspeeded conditions, but were disproportionately slower for audiovisually incongruent trials. Bayesian modeling showed that aging did not affect the ability to arbitrate between integration and segregation under either unspeeded or speeded conditions. However, modeling the within-trial dynamics of evidence accumulation under speeded conditions revealed that older observers accumulate noisier auditory representations for longer, set higher decisional thresholds, and have impaired motor speed. Older observers preserve audiovisual localization performance, despite noisier sensory representations, by sacrificing response speed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).","Journal":"Journal of invertebrate pathology","Date":"Nov 2019","Keywords":"Adalia bipunctata, Coccinella septempunctata, Lady beetles, Microsporidia, Nosema adaliae, Pathogen","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Lady beetles are important predators in nature. Some species, including the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., are native to North America, whereas others, such as the seven-spotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., have been introduced in North America for pest control on agriculture crops. Microsporidia are obligate pathogens that cause chronic disease, and these pathogens are known to infect several lady beetle species. Lady beetles are cannibalistic and, because many species share a given landscape, there is potential for microsporidia to infect susceptible coccinellids when infected eggs are eaten. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the microsporidium Nosema adaliae isolated from A. bipunctata on C. septempunctata fitness (larval development and mortality, sex ratio, adult longevity and fecundity). Mortality was higher for C. septempunctata larvae that ate four A. bipunctata eggs (≥96% mortality) than for those that ate only one (&lt;63.8%), suggesting that the mortality observed was influenced by the number of eggs eaten. A. bipunctata eggs contain adaline and adalinine, two species-specific alkaloids that have been shown to be detrimental to C. septempunctata larvae. Development of larvae that consumed one uninfected or one N. adaliae-infected A. bipunctata egg, did not differ significantly (20.5 ± 0.2 d and 21.3 ± 0.4 d, respectively) and, although mortality remained high for these larvae (53.5% and 65.6% mortality, respectively), these values also did not differ significantly (p = 0.05). Over a 60-d period, mean fecundity for C. septempunctata adults that ate one uninfected A. bipunctata egg as first-instar larvae was significantly greater (776.6 ± 122.0 eggs) than those that ate one N. adaliae-infected egg (335.6 ± 86.6 eggs, p = 0.005). Larvae from the former group also lived significantly longer (58.2 ± 1.8 d) than did those from the latter group (38.4 ± 6.4 d, p = 0.010). Sex ratios of adult beetles did not differ significantly. Because A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata share similar habitats, it is reasonable to expect these two coccinellids to encounter one another in nature. Results of this study show that the consumption of only one infected A. bipunctata egg by C. septempunctata larvae can result in high larval mortality and reduced fecundity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As a result of the aging process the bone deteriorates in composition, structure and function. Age-related musculoskeletal losses are a major public health burden because they can cause physical disability and increased mortality. We tried to find out on a small set of old women, without risk factors for osteoporosis, what caused them the loss of bone minerals. All 492 women had just only one risk factor - the old age. Laboratory findings have shown a decreased serum C telopeptide and low serum alkaline phosphatase circulating markers, used to quantify bone resorption and formation, and very low level of vitamin D. Very low level of vitamin D that disrupted calcium absorption through the intestine, and decreased calcemia increased parathyroid hormone levels with resulting bone effect. The manifestation of physiological aging is worsening eyesight, peripheral neuropathy, depression, worsening of physical condition, skin aging, sarcopenia and bone mineral loss. Senile osteoporosis, which is not caused by known risk factors for osteoporosis, does not appear to be a separate disease, but is part of the physiological process of aging. Treatment of senile osteoporosis should be focused on the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism by administration of vitamin D and calcium. The risk of fractures in the advanced age is determined by a large number of factors ranging from hazards in the home environment to frailty and poor balance.</AbstractText>"}

To increase initiation of treatment, we developed a single-session, online, primary care-based intervention ('mobilization tool'). We evaluated the mobilization tool's acceptability for primary care patients with obesity, trial design feasibility, and signal of an effect of the tool on treatment initiation. In this cluster randomized feasibility trial, primary care providers (PCPs) were randomized to a mobilization tool or comparator tool arm. Patients with obesity and a scheduled appointment with a randomized PCP were assigned to complete the mobilization or comparator tool prior to their appointment. The online mobilization tool asks patients to answer questions about a variety of weight-related topics and then provides automated, tailored feedback that addresses psychosocial determinants of weight loss treatment initiation. The comparator tool provided a nontailored description of treatments. All participants were offered free enrollment in behavioral weight loss treatments. Six PCPs were randomized. Sixty patients (57% female; 66% white; aged 55 ± 13 years) participated in this study of 296 contacted for eligibility evaluation (20.2%). Six-month follow-up assessments were completed by 65% (22/34) of the mobilization and 73% (19/26) of comparator tool participants. Participants completing the acceptability survey reported that the mobilization tool was usable, enjoyable, informative, and useful. Weight loss treatment was initiated by 59% (n = 19) of mobilization and 33% (n = 8) of comparator tool participants.

Yet studies of brain ECM roles in tumor cell behavior have been difficult due to lack of access to the human brain. We present a tunable 3D bioengineered brain tissue platform by integrating microenvironmental cues of native brain-derived ECMs and live imaging to systematically evaluate patient-derived brain tumor responses. Using pediatric ependymoma and adult glioblastoma as examples, the 3D brain ECM-containing microenvironment with a balance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions supports distinctive phenotypes associated with tumor type-specific and ECM-dependent patterns in the tumor cells' transcriptomic and release profiles. Label-free metabolic imaging of the composite model structure identifies metabolically distinct sub-populations within a tumor type and captures extracellular lipid-containing droplets with potential implications in drug response. The versatile bioengineered 3D tumor tissue system sets the stage for mechanistic studies deciphering microenvironmental role in brain tumor progression.</AbstractText>"}

One of these sensors, Sestrin-2, functions as an intracellular sensor of cytosolic leucine and inhibitor of mTORC1 activity. Genetic studies of Sestrin-2 have confirmed its critical role in regulating mTORC1 activity, especially in the case of leucine starvation. Sestrin-2 is known to be transcriptionally controlled by several mechanisms; however, the post-translational proteolytic regulation of Sestrin-2 remains unclear. Here, we explored how Sestrin-2 is regulated through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Using an unbiased screening approach of an siRNA library targeting ubiquitin E3 ligases, we identified a RING-type E3 ligase, ring finger protein 186 (RNF186), that critically mediates the Sestrin-2 ubiquitination and degradation. We observed that RNF186 and Sestrin-2 bind each other through distinct C-terminal motifs and that Lys-13 in Sestrin-2 is a putative ubiquitin acceptor site. RNF186 knockdown increased Sestrin-2 protein levels and decreased mTORC1 activation. These results reveal a new mechanism of E3 ligase control of mTORC1 activity through the RNF186-Sestrin-2 axis, suggesting that RNF186 inhibition may be a potential strategy to increase levels of the mTORC1 inhibitor Sestrin-2.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Lear et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, we propose that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from unconventional model organisms may retain certain species-specific features that can consequently be investigated in depth <i>in vitro</i>; we use hibernating mammals as an example. Many species (including ground squirrels, bats and bears) can enter a prolonged state of physiological dormancy known as hibernation to survive unfavorable seasonal conditions. Our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the rapid transition and adaptation to a hypothermic, metabolically suppressed winter torpor state remains limited partially because of the lack of an easily accessible model. To address the fascinating unanswered questions underlying hibernation biology, we have developed a powerful model system: iPSCs from a hibernating species, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>). These stem cells can potentially be differentiated into any cell type, and can be used for the analysis of cell-autonomous mechanisms that facilitate adaptation to hibernation and for comparisons with non-hibernators. Furthermore, we can manipulate candidate molecular and cellular pathways underlying relevant physiological phenomena by pharmacological or RNAi-based methods, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Moreover, iPSC strategies can be applied to other species (e.g. seals, naked mole rats, humming birds) for <i>in vitro</i> studies on adaptation to extreme physiological conditions. In this Commentary, we discuss factors to consider when attempting to generate iPSCs from unconventional model organisms, based on our experience with the thirteen-lined ground squirrel.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

However, over the last few years, novel agents have produced unprecedented outcomes in treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. With the advent of these targeted agents, treatment options have diversified very considerably and new questions have emerged. For example, it is unclear whether these novel agents should be used as sequential monotherapies until disease progression or whether they should preferably be combined in time-limited treatment regimens aimed at achieving deep and durable remissions. While both approaches yield high response rates and long progression-free and overall survival, it remains challenging to identify patients individually for the optimal concept.

An external force causes primary injury, which is followed by secondary injury that triggers chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying post-TBI secondary injury might provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases. The secondary injury is known to share some physiological features with neurodegenerative diseases. So far, many TBI models in mammals exist, but models in other species are required from the viewpoint of lifespan and animal welfare. In <i>Drosophila</i>, closed and open TBI models are available. Both models have focused on TBI-induced changes in innate immunity. Aging strongly induces innate immunity responses, and neuroinflammation plays an important role in both mammalian models of TBI and humans with TBI. Although <i>Drosophila</i> models do not mimic all phenomena involved in post-TBI secondary injury in mammals, further experiments with <i>Drosophila</i> models and other animal models could elucidate the mechanisms involved in post-TBI secondary brain injury, which would in turn elucidate neurodegenerative processes.</AbstractText>"}

This is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, which leads to dementia. Pharmacological treatments for AD are mainly targeted on its symptoms like memory loss and cognitive impairment. The pathophysiology involved in AD is intra-neuronal accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein as neurofibrillary tangle and extra cellular beta amyloid plaque deposition, which is due to oxidative stress. Here we review the neuro-protective effects of Resveratrol (RSV) and its treatment efficacy in AD. RSV is a naturally available polyphenolic compound, which has antioxidant, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties. RSV crosses blood brain barrier and exerts its antioxidant effect by enhancing the anti-oxidant enzymes. RSV is involved in Sirtuin (SIRT1) mediated lifespan extension activity. RSV has reduced glial activation and helped in increasing the hippocampal neurogenesis. RSV was able to decrease the expression of amyloid precursor protein, along with improvement of spatial working memory. Since RSV acts as an antioxidant, it can be safely used as oral drug.</AbstractText>"}

Similar defects are found in patients and in mice with a mutated dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) and in knockout mice devoid of this receptor, suggesting that this isoform is responsible for the effects of the thyroid hormones in hematopoiesis. However, the hematological phenotype of mice lacking also TRβ has not yet been examined. We show here that TRα1/TRβ-knockout female mice, lacking all known thyroid hormone receptors with capacity to bind thyroid hormones, do not have overt anemia and in contrast with hypothyroid mice do not present reduced Gata1 or Hif1 gene expression. Similar to that found in hypothyroidism or TRα deficiency during the juvenile period, the B-cell population is reduced in the spleen and bone marrow of ageing TRα1/TRβ-knockout mice, suggesting that TRβ does not play a major role in B-cell development. However, splenic hypotrophy is more marked in hypothyroid mice than in TRα1/TRβ-knockout mice and the splenic population of T-lymphocytes is not significantly impaired in these mice in contrast with the reduction found in hypothyroidism. Our results show that the overall hematopoietic phenotype of the TRα1/TRβ-knockout mice is milder than that found in the absence of hormone. Although other mechanism/s cannot be ruled out, our results suggest that the unoccupied TRs could have a negative effect on hematopoiesis, likely secondary to repression of hematopoietic gene expression.</AbstractText>"}

We found 5 distinct clusters (sizes: N = 38, 16, 24, 14, and 21) whose composition was independent of phenotypical groups. Two clusters showed biomarker profiles linked to neurodegenerative processes not associated with classical AD-related pathophysiology. One cluster was characterized by the neuroinflammation biomarker YKL-40. Combining nonlinear data aggregation with informative biomarkers can generate novel patient strata which are representative of cellular/molecular pathophysiology and may aid in predicting disease evolution and mechanistic drug response.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A piecewise regression across age identified an inflection point at 43 years old, where WMH total volume began to increase with age. Subsequent analyses focused on participants above that age (N = 351). WMH total volume had significant inverse correlations with perceptual speed and memory. Regional measures of WMH showed inverse correlations with all reference abilities. We performed principal component analysis of the regional WMH data to create a model of principal components regression. Parietal WMH regional volume burden mediated the relationship between age and perceptual speed in simple and multiple mediation models. The principal components regression pattern associated with perceptual speed also mediated the relationship between age and perceptual speed performance.

We examined longitudinal changes in the scaling behavior of motor activity fluctuations during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 1068 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Motor activity of up to 10 days was recorded annually for up to 13 years. Cognitive assessments and clinical diagnoses were administered annually in the same participants. We found that fractal regulation gradually degraded over time (p &lt; 0.0001) even during the stage with no cognitive impairment. The degradation rate was more than doubled after the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and more than doubled further after the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (p's ≤ 0.0005). Besides, the longitudinal degradation of fractal regulation significantly correlated with the decline in cognitive performance throughout the progression from no cognitive impairment to mild cognitive impairment, and to AD (p &lt; 0.001). All effects remained the same in subsequent sensitivity analyses that included only 255 decedents with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's pathology.

We found that some APP/PS1 mice performed poorly, whereas others performed as well as nontransgenic mice. We took advantage of this intragroup variability to identify the best predictor of cognitive deficits. In this APP/PS1 cohort, soluble and insoluble amyloid-β levels did not correlate significantly with cognitive performance. However, we found that cognitive performance within the APP/PS1 group had a strong inverse correlation with Aβ plaque load and mammalian target of rapamycin activation and positively correlated with autophagy activation.

Whereas the mechanisms for these processes are incompletely understood, both aging (AG) and a loss of ovarian estrogens play contributing roles. Furthermore, the timing of when estradiol (E) treatment should commence and for how long are key clinical questions in the management of symptoms. Using a rat model of surgical menopause, we determined the effects of regimens of E treatment with differing time at onset and duration of treatment on diurnal rhythms of activity and core temperature and on food intake and body weight. Reproductively mature (MAT, ∼4 months) or AG (∼11 months) female rats were ovariectomized, implanted intraperitoneally with a telemetry device, and given either a vehicle (V) or E subcutaneous capsule implantation. Rats were remotely recorded for 10 days per month for 3 (MAT) or 6 (AG) months. To ascertain whether delayed onset of treatment affected rhythms, a subset of AG-V rats had their capsules switched to E at the end of 3 months. Another set of AG-E rats had their capsules removed at 3 months to determine whether beneficial effects of E would persist. Overall, activity and temperature mesor, robustness, and amplitude declined with AG. Compared to V treatment, E-treated rats showed (1) better maintenance of body weight and food intake; (2) higher, more consolidated activity and temperature rhythms; and (3) higher activity and temperature robustness and amplitude. In the AG arm of the study, switching treatment from V to E or E to V quickly reversed these patterns. Thus, the presence of E was the dominant factor in determining stability and amplitude of locomotor activity and temperature rhythms. As a whole, the results show benefits of E treatment, even with a delay, on biological rhythms and physiological functions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Duplicates were subjected to artificial aging using thermal cycling and mechanical loading. Subsequent to wear analysis, templates and duplicates were loaded to fracture and were examined using thermal gravimetric analysis (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For both RBCs, a relevant uptake of water was identified, which was more pronounced in the duplicates. Tribological analyses indicated relevant signs of wear in both templates and duplicates. While qualitative analyses indicated macroscopically similar wear traces in templates and duplicates, data showed that wear of FDPs was underrated in the laboratory analyses.

We therefore aimed at investigating blood gene expression patterns associated with cognitive aging using a population-based sample of 235 middle-aged monozygotic twin pairs with longitudinal data on cognitive function. This unique setup enabled examination of gene expression differences associated with individual and intrapair differences in cognitive level and change while controlling for underlying genetic variation and shared early environment. Overall, increased expression of several gene sets was found to strongly correlate with a lower cognitive level and cognitive decline. The most significantly correlated gene sets were related to protein metabolism, translation, RNA metabolism, infectious disease, and the immune system, which are all processes previously linked to transcription signatures of pathological and normal brain aging, and aging in blood. The results of our study thus suggest that gene expression patterns of cognitive level and decline in our sample mirror those seen in cognitively impaired individuals, which could point toward a more generic response to cognitive aging and aging in general.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study measured regional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response to a spatial Simon/Stroop task in community-dwelling older adults (N = 20, 63-80y). Preferred pace, fast pace, and dual-task gait speeds (picking up objects at preferred pace; fast walking over obstacles) were measured across a 7-meter course. Time to complete a fast pace 400 m walk test was also recorded. Partial correlations were used for all analyses after adjusting for age. Accuracy on incongruent trials of the spatial task was positively correlated with all fast walking conditions (all p &lt; 0.01), but not preferred pace walking conditions. BOLD signal change in the left middle frontal gyrus during the spatial task was associated with preferred pace gait speed (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) and fast walking over obstacles (r = 0.53, p = 0.01).

The RV-NPL differs from the NPL in that RVs are analyzed, and allele sharing among affected relative-pairs is estimated only for minor alleles. Analyzing families can increase power because causal variants with familial aggregation usually have larger effect sizes than those underlying sporadic diseases. Differing from association analysis, for NPL only affected individuals are analyzed, which can increase power, since unaffected family members can be susceptibility variant carriers. RV-NPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, inclusion of nonpathogenic variants, as well as allelic and locus heterogeneity and can readily be applied outside of coding regions. In contrast to analyzing common variants using NPL, where loci localize to large genomic regions (e.g., &gt;50 Mb), mapped regions are well defined for RV-NPL. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that RV-NPL is substantially more powerful than applying traditional NPL methods to analyze RVs. The RV-NPL was applied to analyze 107 late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) pedigrees of Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry with WGS data, and statistically significant linkage (LOD ≥ 3.8) was found with RVs in PSMF1 and PTPN21 which have been shown to be involved in LOAD etiology. Additionally, nominally significant linkage was observed with RVs in ABCA7, ACE, EPHA1, and SORL1, genes that were previously reported to be associated with LOAD.

Aged OPCs become unresponsive to pro-differentiation signals, suggesting intrinsic constraints on therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing OPC differentiation. This decline in functional capacity is associated with hallmarks of cellular aging, including decreased metabolic function and increased DNA damage. Fasting or treatment with metformin can reverse these changes and restore the regenerative capacity of aged OPCs, improving remyelination in aged animals following focal demyelination.

Here, expression variation among integrants was followed for hundreds of individual proviral clones within polyclonal populations throughout successive rounds of virus and cultured cell replication, with limited findings using CD4+ cells from donor blood consistent with observations in immortalized cells. Tracking clonal behavior by proviral 'zip codes' indicated that mutational inactivation during reverse transcription was rare, while clonal expansion and proviral expression states varied widely. By sorting for provirus expression using a GFP reporter in the nef open reading frame, distinct clone-specific variation in on/off proportions were observed that spanned three orders of magnitude. Tracking GFP phenotypes over time revealed that as cells divided, their progeny alternated between HIV transcriptional activity and non-activity. Despite these phenotypic oscillations, the overall GFP+ population within each clone was remarkably stable, with clones maintaining clone-specific equilibrium mixtures of GFP+ and GFP- cells. Integration sites were analyzed for correlations between genomic features and the epigenetic phenomena described here. Integrants inserted in the sense orientation of genes were more frequently found to be GFP negative than those in the antisense orientation, and clones with high GFP+ proportions were more distal to repressive H3K9me3 peaks than low GFP+ clones. Clones with low frequencies of GFP positivity appeared to expand more rapidly than clones for which most cells were GFP+, even though the tested proviruses were Vpr-. Thus, much of the increase in the GFP- population in these polyclonal pools over time reflected differential clonal expansion. Together, these results underscore the temporal and quantitative variability in HIV-1 gene expression among proviral clones that are conferred in the absence of metabolic or cell-type dependent variability, and shed light on cell-intrinsic layers of regulation that affect HIV-1 population dynamics.</AbstractText>"}

Our data indicated that cell proliferation and migration of the oxidative stress-induced senescent vascular smooth muscle cells were obviously desensitized to stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, which may have been caused by suppression of promoter activity, transcription, translation, and activation levels of PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-β. The analyzed data obtained from the binding array of transcription factors (TFs) showed that binding levels of eighteen TFs on the PDGFR-β promoter region (-523 to -1) were significantly lower in senescent cells compared to those of non-senescent cells. Among these TFs, the bioinformatics prediction suggested that the putative binding sites of ten TFs were found in this promoter region. Of these, transcriptional levels of seven TFs were markedly reduced in senescent cells. The clinical data showed that the proportion of restenosis was relatively lower in the older group than that in the younger group.

The silencing of these neurons, especially those with high thresholds and low spontaneous rates, degrades auditory processing and may contribute to difficulties in understanding speech in noise. Although cochlear synaptopathy can be diagnosed in animals by measuring suprathreshold auditory brainstem responses, its diagnosis in humans remains a challenge. In mice, cochlear synaptopathy is also correlated with measures of middle ear muscle (MEM) reflex strength, possibly because the missing high-threshold neurons are important drivers of this reflex. The authors hypothesized that measures of the MEM reflex might be better than other assays of peripheral function in predicting difficulties hearing in difficult listening environments in human subjects.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='DESIGN' NlmCategory='METHODS'>The authors recruited 165 normal-hearing healthy subjects, between 18 and 63 years of age, with no history of ear or hearing problems, no history of neurologic disorders, and unremarkable otoscopic examinations. Word recognition in quiet and in difficult listening situations was measured in four ways: using isolated words from the Northwestern University auditory test number six corpus with either (a) 0 dB signal to noise, (b) 45% time compression with reverberation, or (c) 65% time compression with reverberation, and (d) with a modified version of the QuickSIN. Audiometric thresholds were assessed at standard and extended high frequencies. Outer hair cell function was assessed by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Middle ear function and reflexes were assessed using three methods: the acoustic reflex threshold as measured clinically, wideband tympanometry as measured clinically, and a custom wideband method that uses a pair of click probes flanking an ipsilateral noise elicitor. Other aspects of peripheral auditory function were assessed by measuring click-evoked gross potentials, that is, summating potential (SP) and action potential (AP) from ear canal electrodes.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>After adjusting for age and sex, word recognition scores were uncorrelated with audiometric or DPOAE thresholds, at either standard or extended high frequencies. MEM reflex thresholds were significantly correlated with scores on isolated word recognition, but not with the modified version of the QuickSIN. The highest pairwise correlations were seen using the custom assay. AP measures were correlated with some of the word scores, but not as highly as seen for the MEM custom assay, and only if amplitude was measured from SP peak to AP peak, rather than baseline to AP peak. The highest pairwise correlations with word scores, on all four tests, were seen with the SP/AP ratio, followed closely by SP itself. When all predictor variables were combined in a stepwise multivariate regression, SP/AP dominated models for all four word score outcomes. MEM measures only enhanced the adjusted r values for the 45% time compression test. The only other predictors that enhanced model performance (and only for two outcome measures) were measures of interaural threshold asymmetry.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Results suggest that, among normal-hearing subjects, there is a significant peripheral contribution to diminished hearing performance in difficult listening environments that is not captured by either threshold audiometry or DPOAEs. The significant univariate correlations between word scores and either SP/AP, SP, MEM reflex thresholds, or AP amplitudes (in that order) are consistent with a type of primary neural degeneration. However, interpretation is clouded by uncertainty as to the mix of pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the click-evoked SP. None of the assays presented here has the sensitivity to diagnose neural degeneration on a case-by-case basis; however, these tests may be useful in longitudinal studies to track accumulation of neural degeneration in individual subjects.</AbstractText>"}

Depending on the etiology, treatment may be quite different, but early diagnosis and correct classification of PH is difficult. With an aging population and recently suggested decreased pulmonary arterial pressure threshold defining PH, we are facing even more diagnostic uncertainties. A new approach to patients' phenotyping is needed. Here we present available data and future perspectives on employing an in-depth analysis of the omics cascade to allow an earlier and more reliable diagnosis and classification of PH. Indeed, with the help of super-fast computing, it became possible to simultaneously consider the levels of thousands of potential biomarkers to find patterns specific for clinically suspected disease. The omics cascade is an invaluable source of information. However, while the genome can be perceived as providing possibilities, transcriptome-as carving them this is metabolome that may tell us 'what is really going on' in an individual living organism. Metabolomics research requires blinded search for characteristic patterns of discreet changes in the levels of detectable metabolites. Since as many as 40,000 various substances are produced as a 'side effect of staying alive', metabolite profiling can be compared to fishing up for organized signals in a universe of chaos. Although difficult, such search for metabolic patterns that might lead to replacing the term biomarker by metabolic fingerprinting in the area of pulmonary circulation has already begun.</AbstractText>"}

Nature offers a wide range of molecules with antioxidant activity able to neutralize, at least in part, the formation of free radicals and therefore to counteract the phenomena of cellular aging. Since synthetic drugs for the treatment of skin diseases can induce resistance, it is particularly interesting to use compounds of plant origin, transporting them in pharmaceutical forms capable of controlling their release and absorption. This review provides an overview of new findings about the use of lipid-based nanosystems for the delivery of natural molecules useful on the topical treatment of skin disorders. Several natural molecules encapsulated in lipid nanosystems have been considered in the treatment of some skin pathologies or diseases. Particularly, the use of rosemary and eucalyptus essential oil, saffron derivatives, curcumin, eugenol, capsaicin, thymol and lycopene has been reported. The molecules have been alternatively encapsulated in viscous systems, such as the organogels, or in liquid systems, such as ethosomes, transferosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and monoolein based dispersions thickened by inclusion in carbomer gels. The nanostructured forms have been in vitro and in vivo investigated for the treatment of skin disorders due to dehydration, inflammation, melanoma, wound healing, fungal infections or psoriasis. The data reported in the different studies have suggested that the cutaneous application of lipid nanosystems allows a deep interaction between lipid matrix and skin strata, promoting a prolonged release and efficacy of the loaded natural molecules. This review suggests that the application of natural molecules onto the skin by lipid-based nanosystems can provide numerous clinician benefits in dermatology and cosmetics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Insulin-like growth factor receptor II (IGF-IIR) has been much implicated in myocardial hypertrophy. Our previous studies have found that increased activities of signaling mediators, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin induces pathological hypertrophy. Given the critical roles played by CaMKII and calcineurin signaling in the progression of maladaptive hypertrophy, we anticipated that inhibition of CaMKII and calcineurin signaling may attenuate IGF-IIR-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The current study, therefore, investigated the effects of IGF-IIR activation on the CaMKII and calcineurin signaling and whether the combinatorial inhibition of the CaMKIIδ and calcineurin signaling could ameliorate IGF-IIR-induced pathological hypertrophy. In the present study, we induced IGF-IIR through the cardiomyocyte-specific transduction of IGFII<sup>Y27L</sup> via adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) to evaluate its effects on cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, it was observed that the activation of IGF-IIR signaling through IGFII<sup>Y27L</sup> induces significant hypertrophy of the myocardium and increased cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. Moreover, we found that Leu<sup>27</sup> IGF-II significantly induced calcineurin and CaMKII expression. Furthermore and importantly, the combinatorial treatment with CaMKII and calcineurin inhibitors significantly alleviates IGF-IIR-induced hypertrophic responses. Thus, it could be envisaged that the inhibition of IGF-IIR may serve as a promising candidate for attenuating maladaptive hypertrophy. Both calcineurin and CaMKII could be valuable targets for developing treatment strategies against hypertension-induced cardiomyopathies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Proteomic dysregulation is considered the key factor for neurodegeneration. Mechanisms involving deregulated processing of proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomerization; tau hyperphosphorylation, prion misfolding; α-synuclein accumulation/lewy body formation, chaperone deregulation, acetylcholine depletion, adenosine 2A (A2A) receptor hyperactivation, secretase deregulation, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation and mitochondrial proteinopathies have deeper implications in neurodegenerative disorders. Better understanding of such pathological mechanisms is pivotal for exploring crucial drug targets. Herein, we provide a comprehensive outlook about the diverse proteomic irregularities in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). We explicate the role of key neuroproteomic drug targets notably Aβ, tau, alpha synuclein, prions, secretases, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), LRRK2, molecular chaperones, A2A receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) and mitochondrial/oxidative stress-related proteins for combating neurodegeneration and associated cognitive and motor impairment. Cross talk between amyloidopathy, synucleinopathy, tauopathy and several other proteinopathies pinpoints the need to develop safe therapeutics with ability to strike multiple targets in the aetiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Therapeutics like microtubule stabilisers, chaperones, kinase inhibitors, anti-aggregation agents and antibodies could serve promising regimens for treating neurodegeneration.

As evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins, TMC proteins are widely involved in diverse sensorimotor functions of many species, such as hearing, chemosensation, egg laying, and food texture detection. Interestingly, recent structural and physiological studies suggest that TMC channels may share a similar membrane topology with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel TMEM16 and the mechanically activated OSCA1.2/TMEM63 channel. Namely, these channels form dimers and each subunit consists of ten transmembrane segments. Despite this important structural insight, a key question remains: what is the gating mechanism of TMC channels? The major technical hurdle to answer this question is that the reconstitution of TMC proteins as functional ion channels has been challenging in mammalian heterologous systems. Since TMC channels are conserved across taxa, genetic studies of TMC channels in model organisms such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish may provide us critical information on the physiological function and regulation of TMCs.

We examine how differences in juvenile mosquito habitat along a spectrum of urban infrastructure abandonment can influence the adult body size of the invasive tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae). Adult Ae. albopictus were collected across 3 yr (2015-2017) from residential blocks in Baltimore, MD, that varied in abandonment level, defined by the proportion of houses with boarded-up doors. We show that female Ae. albopictus collected from sites with higher abandonment were significantly larger than those collected from higher income, low abandonment blocks. Heterogeneity in mosquito body size, including wing length, has been shown to reflect differences in important traits, including longevity and vector competence. The present work demonstrates that heterogeneity in female size may reflect juvenile habitat variability across the spatial scales most relevant to adult Aedes dispersal and human exposure risk in urban landscapes. Previous work has shown that failure to manage abandonment and waste issues in impoverished neighborhoods supports greater mosquito production, and this study suggests that mosquitoes in these same neighborhoods could live longer, produce more eggs, and have different vector potential.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Convergent lines of evidence, including genome-wide association studies, strongly implicate neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD. Several dietary agents, including phenolic-rich foods, show promise for the prevention and/or management of AD, which in large part, has been attributed to their anti-inflammatory effects. We previously reported that a food-grade phenolic-enriched maple syrup extract (MSX) inhibited neuroinflammation <i>in vitro</i> but whether these effects are translatable <i>in vivo</i> remain unknown. Herein, we assessed MSX's ability to attenuate early neuroinflammation in a transgenic mouse model of AD. <b>Methods:</b> The effects of MSX on AD-related neuroinflammation was evaluated by orally administering MSX (100 and 200 mg/kg/day for 30 days) to the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. The expression of inflammatory markers in mouse brains were analyzed with LC-MS/MS with SWATH acquisition. <b>Results:</b> 3xTg-AD mice dosed orally with MSX have decreased expression of several inflammatory proteins, including, most notably, the AD risk-associated protein 'triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2' (TREM2), and stimulator of interferon genes TMEM173, and suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6). However, this decrease in inflammation did not coincide with a decrease in pathogenic amyloid generation or lipid peroxidation. <b>Discussion:</b> These data demonstrate that oral administration of this maple syrup derived natural product reduces key neuroinflammatory indices of AD in the 3xTg-AD model of AD. Therefore, further studies to investigate MSX's potential as a dietary intervention strategy for AD prevention and/or management are warranted.</AbstractText>"}

One essential protein complex involved in this process is the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase. It has been shown that the inhibition of TOR leads to a considerable upsurge in the amino acid levels. This molecular phenotype relies mainly on the availability of light, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To validate the time-resolved response of C and N metabolites, we used a targeted gas chromatography mass spectrometery (GC-MS)-based metabolomic approach, where we examined the response of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> upon TOR inhibition under C-limited condition, namely extended darkness. Contrary to C-supplemented conditions, the rapid increase in the amino acid levels is suppressed almost completely 4 h after TOR inhibition, confirming that C supply is essential to raise the amino acid levels mediated by their <i>de novo</i> synthesis. An exception to this observation was the levels of aspartate, which is presumably synthesized via the anaplerotic pathway. In agreement with previous reports, TOR repression, under these C-limited conditions, leads to a significant reduction in the C/N ratio, corroborating with the crucial role of the pathway in maintaining the metabolic balance of the cells and consequently propelling growth.</AbstractText>"}

Using a novel scene paradigm, the current series of studies investigated how schemas affect memory for schematic and non-schematic information, as well as how directed encoding influences remembering of both types of information in younger and older adults. Results showed poorer accurate recognition of non-schematic information relative to schematic information, influenced largely by a bias in identifying non-schematic items as 'new'. While directed encoding was able to increase remembering of non-schematic information and decrease bias across both age groups, the present set of studies highlights the pervasive influence of a schema on memory for non-schematic information.</AbstractText>"}

If the impact of IgG post-translational modifications (PTMs) on FcRn binding is well documented, it is far less reported for HSA despite numerous PTMs occurring on the protein in plasma. HSA is susceptible to numerous degradation reactions in plasma, because of aging, oxidative stress or liver and pancreas related pathologies. In the present study, we combined FcRn affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to investigate the impact of HSA PTMs upon FcRn binding. This methodology presents the advantage to distinguish the effect of a single modification from a plasma HSA preparation made of a mixture of different isoforms. Cys<sub>34</sub> oxidation, Lys<sub>525</sub> glycation, and Leu<sub>585</sub> C-terminal truncation, which are modifications related to several pathological conditions, were demonstrated to act negatively on HSA-FcRn interaction. The HSA-FcRn binding alteration generated by these modifications is consistent with their vicinity with the interaction interface of the two proteins. Results were discussed regarding altered half-life of HSA observed in several disease states and pave the way toward new understandings of the hypoalbuminemia pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this study, we investigated the impact of several post-translational modifications of HSA toward its ability to bind to the neonatal Fc receptor using in vitro affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry, and surface plasmon resonance. Cys34 oxidation, Lys525 glycation, and Leu585 C-terminal truncation were demonstrated to decrease HSA-FcRn binding.

Like the human form, mouse Cdkn2a encodes two distinct proteins-p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>, which blocks cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and p19<sup>Arf</sup>, which is best known as a positive regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor-and their functions have been well-studied in genetically engineered mouse models. Relatively little is known about how expression of the two transcripts is controlled in normal development and in certain disease states. To better understand their coordinate and transcript-specific expression in situ, we used a transposase-aided approach to generate a new BAC transgenic mouse model in which the first exons encoding Arf and Ink4a are replaced by fluorescent reporters. We show that mouse embryo fibroblasts generated from the transgenic lines faithfully display induction of each transgenic reporter in cell culture models, and we demonstrate the expected expression of the Arf reporter in the normal testis, one of the few places where that promoter is normally expressed. Interestingly, the TGFβ-2-dependent induction of the Arf reporter in the eye-a process essential for normal eye development-does not occur. Our findings illustrate the value of BAC transgenesis in mapping key regulatory elements in the mouse by revealing the genomic DNA required for Cdkn2a induction in cultured cells and the developing testis, and the apparent lack of elements driving expression in the developing eye.</AbstractText>"}

The molecular causes of AD are still poorly understood. However, recent studies have shown that Alternative Splicing (AS) is involved in the gene expression reprogramming associated with the functional changes observed in AD patients. In particular, mutations in cis-acting regulatory sequences as well as alterations in the activity and sub-cellular localization of trans-acting splicing factors and components of the spliceosome machinery are associated with splicing abnormalities in AD tissues, which may influence the onset and progression of the disease. In this review, we discuss the current molecular understanding of how alterations in the AS process contribute to AD pathogenesis.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI), the symptomatic therapy in AD, attenuate and delay the cognitive deficit by enhancing cholinergic synapses. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor has shown a double-edged sword feature, as it binds with high affinity Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, promoting intracellular accumulation and Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation, but also exerts neuroprotection by stimulating anti-apoptotic pathways. Moreover, it mediates peripheral and central anti-inflammatory response, being the effector player of the activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), that, by decreasing the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, it may have a role in improving cognition. The finding in preclinical models that, in addition to their major function (choline esterase inhibition) AChEIs have neuroprotective properties mediated via α7nAChR and modulate innate immunity, possibly as a result of the increased availability of acetylcholine activating the CAIP, pave the way for new pharmacological intervention in AD and other neurological disorders that are characterized by neuroinflammation. CHRFAM7A is a human-specific gene acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of α7nAChR function, also suggesting a role in affecting human cognition and memory by altering α7nAChR activities in the central nervous system (CNS). This review will summarize the current knowledge on the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in aging-related disorders, and will argue that the presence of the human-restricted CHRFAM7A gene might play a fundamental role in the regulation of CAIP and in the response to AChEI.</AbstractText>"}

This cell plasticity has been associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program (EMT) and can be regulated by tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms and complex interactions with various tumor microenvironment (TME) components. These interactions favor the generation of a specific 'CSC niche' that helps maintain the main properties, phenotypic plasticity and metastatic potential of this subset of tumor cells. For this reason, TME has been recognized as an important promoter of tumor progression and therapy resistance. Tumors have evolved a network of immunosuppressive mechanisms that limits the cytotoxic T cell response to cancer cells. Some key players in this network are tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, which not only favor a pro-tumoral and immunosuppressive environment that supports tumor growth and immune evasion, but also negatively influences immunotherapy. Here, we review the relevance of cytokines and growth factors provided by immunosuppressive immune cells in regulating cancer-cell plasticity. We also discuss how cancer cells remodel their own niche to promote proliferation, stemness and EMT, and escape immune surveillance. A better understanding of CSC-TME crosstalk signaling will enable the development of effective targeted or immune therapies that block tumor growth and metastasis.</AbstractText>"}

The addition of Cu has been proven to be an effective way to develop a new kind of Co-based alloy with good antibacterial properties. In this paper, the effect of heat treatment on the corrosion property, the tribology property and the antibacterial property of Cu containing Co-based alloys were investigated in detail. The microstructure observation showed that the as-cast alloys mainly consisted of a dendritic matrix with carbide dispersion at grain boundaries and a fine Cu-rich phase in the matrix and at the carbide/matrix interface. The carbide precipitates and the distribution of Cu phases affected significantly the friction coefficient and wear resistance of Co-xCu alloy. Annealing at 1060 °C/24 h promoted the precipitation of carbide and in turn increased the hardness and wear resistance markedly. Heat treatments, including annealing, solid solution and ageing treatment, enhanced the corrosion resistance of Co-xCu alloy without reduction in antibacterial properties. However, the addition of Cu increased the corrosion resistance and antibacterial properties but reduced the wear resistance especially at high Cu content.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which CMA is generated in collagen and detected CMA in collagen-rich tissues. When various protein samples were incubated with glucose, the CMA content, detected using a monoclonal antibody, increased in a time-dependent manner only in glycated collagen, whereas the formation of <i>N<sup>ε</sup></i> -(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), a major antigenic AGE, was detected in all glycated proteins. Dominant CMA formation in glycated collagen was also observed by electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). During incubation of glucose with collagen, CMA formation was enhanced with increasing glucose concentration, whereas it was inhibited in the presence of dicarbonyl-trapping reagents and a metal chelator. CMA formation was also observed upon incubating collagen with glyoxal, and CMA was generated in a time-dependent manner when glyoxal was incubated with type I-IV collagens. To identify hotspots of CMA formation, tryptic digests of glycated collagen were applied to an affinity column conjugated with anti-CMA. Several CMA peptides that are important for recognition by integrins were detected by LC-MS/MS and amino acid sequence analyses. CMA formation on each sequence was confirmed by incubation of the synthesized peptides with glyoxal and ribose. LC-MS detected CMA in the mouse skin at a higher level than other AGEs. Furthermore, CMA accumulation was greater in the human aorta of older individuals.

Biological aging of the cognitive and postural control system appears to be responsible for increased cognitive-motor interference effects. We examined neural and behavioral markers of motor-cognitive dual-task performance in young and old adults performing spatial one-back working memory single and dual tasks during semitandem stance. On the neural level, we used EEG to test for age-related modulations in the frequency domain related to cognitive-postural task load. Twenty-eight healthy young and 30 old adults participated in this study. The tasks included a postural single task, a cognitive-postural dual task, and a cognitive-postural triple task (cognitive dual-task with postural demands). Postural sway (i.e., total center of pressure displacements) was recorded in semistance position on an unstable surface that was placed on top of a force plate while performing cognitive tasks. Neural activation was recorded using a 64-channel mobile EEG system. EEG frequencies were attenuated by the baseline postural single-task condition and demarcated in nine Regions-of-Interest (ROIs), i.e., anterior, central, posterior, over the cortical midline, and both hemispheres. Our findings revealed impaired cognitive dual-task performance in old compared to young participants in the form of significantly lower cognitive performance in the triple-task condition. Furthermore, old adults compared with young adults showed significantly larger postural sway, especially in cognitive-postural task conditions. With respect to EEG frequencies, young compared to old participants showed significantly lower alpha-band activity in cognitive-cognitive-postural triple-task conditions compared with cognitive-postural dual tasks. In addition, with increasing task difficulty, we observed synchronized theta and delta frequencies, irrespective of age. Task-dependent alterations of the alpha frequency band were most pronounced over frontal and central ROIs, while alterations of the theta and delta frequency bands were found in frontal, central, and posterior ROIs. Theta and delta synchronization exhibited a decrease from anterior to posterior regions. For old adults, task difficulty was reflected by theta synchronization in the posterior ROI. For young adults, it was reflected by alpha desynchronization in bilateral anterior ROIs. In addition, we could not identify any effects of task difficulty and age on the beta frequency band. Our results shed light on age-related cognitive and postural declines and how they interact. Modulated alpha frequencies during high cognitive-postural task demands in young but not old adults might be reflective of a constrained neural adaptive potential in old adults. Future studies are needed to elucidate associations between the identified age-related performance decrements with task difficulty and changes in brain activity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Hannah Bohle et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Neuroscience","Date":"Nov 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Recent advances suggest that the response of RNA metabolism to stress has an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementias and Alzheimer disease. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control the utilization of mRNA during stress, in part through the formation of membraneless organelles termed stress granules (SGs). These structures form through a process of liquid-liquid phase separation. Multiple biochemical pathways regulate SG biology. The major signalling pathways regulating SG formation include the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) and eIF2α pathways, whereas the pathways regulating SG dispersion and removal are mediated by valosin-containing protein and the autolysosomal cascade. Post-translational modifications of RBPs also strongly contribute to the regulation of SGs. Evidence indicates that SGs are supposed to be transient structures, but the chronic stresses associated with ageing lead to chronic, persistent SGs that appear to act as a nidus for the aggregation of disease-related proteins. We suggest a model describing how intrinsic vulnerabilities within the cellular RNA metabolism might lead to the pathological aggregation of RBPs when SGs become persistent. This process might accelerate the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies, and it suggests new targets for disease intervention.</AbstractText>"}

We have previously demonstrated that HIPK2 binds and phosphorylates High-Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1), an architectural chromatinic protein ubiquitously expressed in embryonic tissues, decreasing its binding affinity to DNA. To better define the functional role of HIPK2 and HMGA1 interaction in vivo, we generated mice in which both genes are disrupted. About 50% of these Hmga1/Hipk2 double knock-out (DKO) mice die within 12 h of life (P1) for respiratory failure. The DKO mice present an altered lung morphology, likely owing to a drastic reduction in the expression of surfactant proteins, that are required for lung development. Consistently, we report that both HMGA1 and HIPK2 proteins positively regulate the transcriptional activity of the genes encoding the surfactant proteins. Moreover, these mice display an altered expression of thyroid differentiation markers, reasonably because of a drastic reduction in the expression of the thyroid-specific transcription factors PAX8 and FOXE1, which we demonstrate here to be positively regulated by HMGA1 and HIPK2. Therefore, these data indicate a critical role of HIPK2/HMGA1 cooperation in lung and thyroid development and function, suggesting the potential involvement of their impairment in the pathogenesis of human lung and thyroid diseases.</AbstractText>"}

However, the degree to which genetic risk of Alzheimer's dementia contributes to late-life motor impairment, and the specific molecular systems underlying these associations, are uncertain. Here, we adopted an integrative multi-omic approach to assess genetic influence on motor impairment in older adults and identified key molecular pathways that may mediate this risk. We built a polygenic risk score for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) and examined its relationship to several motor phenotypes in 1885 older individuals from two longitudinal aging cohorts. We found that AD-PRS was associated with a previously validated composite motor scores and their components. The major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's dementia, the APOE/TOMM40 locus, was not a major driver of these associations. To identify specific molecular features that potentially medicate the genetic risk into motor dysfunction, we examined brain multi-omics, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, histone acetylation (H3K9AC), and targeted proteomics, as well as diverse neuropathologies. We found that a small number of factors account for the majority of the influence of AD-PRS on motor function, which comprises paired helical filament tau-tangle density, H3K9AC in specific chromosomal regions encoding genes involved in neuromuscular process. These multi-omic factors have the potential to elucidate key molecular mechanisms developing motor impairment in the context of Alzheimer's dementia.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is unclear how H<sub>2</sub>S production is regulated by pathways related to DR. Due to the importance of mTORC1 pathway in DR, we investigated the effects of Sch9, a yeast homolog of mammalian S6K1 and a major substrate of mTORC1 on H<sub>2</sub>S production in yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We found that inhibition of the mTORC1-Sch9 pathway by <i>SCH9</i> deletion, rapamycin or myriocin treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in H<sub>2</sub>S production. Although deficiency of <i>SCH9</i> did not alter the intracellular level of methionine, the intracellular level of cysteine increased in <i>Δsch9</i> cells. The expression of <i>CYS3</i> and <i>CYS4</i>, two transsulfuration pathway genes encoding cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), were also decreased under mTORC1-Sch9 inhibition. Overexpression of <i>CYS3</i> or <i>CYS4</i> in <i>Δsch9</i> cells or WT cells treated with rapamycin rescued the deficiency of H<sub>2</sub>S production. Finally, we also observed a reduction in H<sub>2</sub>S production and lowering of both mRNA and protein levels of CGL and CBS in cultured human cells treated with rapamycin to reduce mTORC1 pathway activity. Thus, our findings reveal a probably conserved mechanism in which H<sub>2</sub>S production by the transsulfuration pathway is regulated by mTORC1-Sch9 signaling.</AbstractText>"}

Recent experiments suggested that the erythroid lineage might differentiate directly from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells/ progenitors or from a highly biased subpopulation of stem cells, rather than transiting through common myeloid progenitors or megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors. We genetically barcoded autologous rhesus macaque stem and progenitor cells, allowing quantitative tracking of the in vivo clonal output of thousands of individual cells over time following transplantation. CD34+ cells were lentiviral-transduced with a high diversity barcode library, with the barcode in an expressed region of the provirus, allowing barcode retrieval from DNA or RNA, with each barcode representing an individual stem or progenitor cell clone. Barcode profiles from bone marrow CD45-CD71+ maturing nucleated red blood cells were compared with other lineages purified from the same bone marrow sample. There was very high correlation of barcode contributions between marrow nucleated red blood cells and other lineages, with the highest correlation between nucleated red blood cells and myeloid lineages, whether at earlier or later time points post transplantation, without obvious clonal contributions from highly erythroid-biased or restricted clones. A similar profile occurred even under stressors such as aging or erythropoietin stimulation. RNA barcode analysis on circulating mature red blood cells followed over long time periods demonstrated stable erythroid clonal contributions. Overall, in this non-human primate model with great relevance to human hematopoiesis, we documented continuous production of erythroid cells from multipotent, non-biased hematopoietic stem cell clones at steady-state or under stress.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although the mechanisms are unclear, increased oxidative stress accelerating cellular aging has been shown to play a role. Mitochondria are the main site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in most cell types. Levels of ROS and the risk for oxidative damage are dictated by the balance between ROS production and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Originally considered as toxic species, physiologic levels of ROS are now known to be essential cell signaling molecules. Using a model of maternal overnutrition in C57BL6N mice, we investigate the mechanisms involved in the development of insulin resistance (IR) in muscle. In red and white gastrocnemius muscles of offspring, we are the first to report characteristics of oxidative phosphorylation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, activity of mitoflashes, and electron transport chain supercomplex formation. Results demonstrate altered mitochondrial function with reduced response to glucose in offspring of mice fed a high-fat and high-sucrose diet, increases in mitochondrial leak respiration, and a reduction in ROS production in red gastrocnemius in response to palmitoyl carnitine. We also demonstrate differences in supercomplex formation between red and white gastrocnemius, which may be integral to fiber-type specialization.

Electroencephalography has been developed to quantitatively explore effects of these neuronal changes of the brain in ASD. The pineal neurohormone melatonin is able to contribute to neural development. Also, this hormone has an inflammation-regulatory role and acts as a circadian key regulator to normalize sleep.

Previously we showed that one of these proteases, tryptase, in addition to its location within granules, can also be found within the mast cell nucleus, where it has the capacity to affect the acetylation profile of nucleosomal core histones in aging cells. Based on this notion, and on the known sensitivity of mast cells to modulation of histone acetylation, we here asked whether tryptase could impact on the responses against cellular stress caused by disturbed histone acetylation status. To address this, wild-type and tryptase-deficient (Mcpt6<sup>-/-</sup>) mast cells were subjected to cell stress caused by trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Wild-type and Mcpt6<sup>-/-</sup> mast cells were equally sensitive to TSA at an early stage of culture (~8 weeks). However, in aging mast cells (&gt;50 weeks), tryptase-deficiency led to increased sensitivity to cell death. To address the underlying mechanism, we assessed effects of tryptase deficiency on the expression of markers for proliferation and cell stress. These analyses revealed aberrant regulation of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, glutaredoxin, and glutathione reductase, as well as blunted upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 in response to TSA in aging cells. Moreover, the absence of tryptase led to increased expression of Psme4/PA200, a proteasome variant involved in the processing of acetylated core histones. Altogether, this study identifies a novel role for tryptase in regulating the manifestations of cell stress in aging mast cells.</AbstractText>"}

Not surprisingly, many of the technologies developed for the use of older adults focus on care. The exclusion of older adults from the research and design of digital technology is often based on such negative stereotypes. In this opinion article, we argue that the inclusion rather than exclusion of older adults in the design process and research of digital technology is essential if technology is to fulfill the promise of improving well-being.

The vimentin network, an intermediate filament (IF) system, is one of the critical cascades by which the cell morphology, growth, and motility are modulated. However, the vimentin-mediated cytoskeletal cross talk, as well as the signaling transduction, which further coordinates the cellular responses during hepatic fibrogenesis, is poorly understood. In the current study, both messenger RNA (mRNA) and the vimentin protein were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in the dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-exposed liver. In particular, vimentin was highly expressed in the activated HSCs. Again, the overexpressed vimentin was observed in the plasma samples derived from patients with hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, suggesting that vimentin may be a key factor in regulating the progression of liver fibrosis. Meanwhile, vimentin knockdown suppressed the migratory propensity, provoked morphological changes, and disturbed the focal adhesions in the HSCs due to the breakdown of associated cytoskeletal proteins. Western blotting showed that vimentin deletion inhibited proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and arrested the Rho GTPase family, thereby impairing the HSCs' growth as well as motility. The phosphorylated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT signals were also notably reduced in response to the silence of vimentin. Inhibitors of selected signaling pathways suppressed the migration and differentiation of activated HSCs by regulating specific serine phosphorylated sites on vimentin. Taken together, these findings revealed a novel mechanism of vimentin through which various signaling pathways controlled the proliferation, differentiation, and movement of the HSCs via the ERK/AKT and Rho cascades.</AbstractText>"}

Endothelial senescence was assessed by measuring beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, protein level by Western blot, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity using zymography. Atrial endothelial senescence was induced by thrombin at clinically relevant concentrations. Thrombin induced the up-regulation of p53, a key regulator in cellular senescence and of p21 and p16, two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH oxidase, cyclooxygenases and the mitochondrial respiration complex contributed to oxidative stress and senescence. Enhanced expression levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, tissue factor, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and MMP-2 and 9 characterized the senescence-associated secretory phenotype of atrial ECs.

The aim of this review was to examine the evidence regarding the influence of hormones on bone metabolism, followed by clinical data of hormonal changes in the elderly, in the attempt to provide possible poorly explored diagnostic and therapeutic candidate targets for the management of primary osteoporosis in the aging population. <b>Material and methods:</b> An extensive Medline search using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library was performed. <b>Results:</b> While the rise in Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels has a protective role on bone mass, the decline of estrogen, testosterone, Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and vitamin D and the rise of cortisol, parathyroid hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) favor bone loss in the elderly. Particularly, the AA rs6166 FSH receptor (FSHR) genotype, encoding for a more sensitive FSHR than that encoded by the GG one, is associated with low total body mass density (BMD), independently of circulating estrogen. A polyclonal antibody with a FSHR-binding sequence against the β-subunit of murine FSH seems to be effective in ameliorating bone loss in ovariectomized mice. <b>Conclusions:</b> A complete hormonal assessment should be completed for both women and men during bone loss evaluation.

The aim of the present study is to examine the correlation between the muscle strength of ankle invertors, evertors, plantar flexors, and dorsal flexors and the control of bipedal stance in young and older adults. Thirty one young (aged 22.8 ± 2.6 years) and thirty one older adults (aged 70.5 ± 7.2 years) voluntarily participated in this study. Ankle muscle strength was evaluated by an isokinetic dynamometer. Normalized peak torque and work were averaged for four repetitions and for both lower limbs. The control of bipedal stance was evaluated by the sample entropy derived from an accelerometer placed on the lumbar spine while the subject stood on a foam pad with eyes open. Results showed significant age-related differences in ankle muscle strength and sample entropy in medial-lateral direction. More interestingly, the correlation between ankle muscle strength and the sample entropy was significantly different between young and older adults. Indeed, no significant correlation was observed in the younger adults. Conversely, in the older adults, the work of the ankle evertors positively correlated with sample entropy in the medial-lateral direction during bipedal stance (r = 0.36), whereas the peak torque and work of the dorsal flexors were significantly correlated with sample entropy in the anterior-posterior direction during bipedal stance (r = 0.44 for both variables). In the young adults, results suggest that, standing on foam with eyes open is a relatively easy postural task that does not require the full ankle muscle strength capacity. Taken together, the present findings suggest that older adults have a different association between ankle muscle strength and the sample entropy during bipedal stance.</AbstractText>"}

A growing number of evidences have identified the representative function of exosomal circRNAs in the physiological state of donor cells, which further induces cellular responses after captured by recipient cells. However, the contributions of circRNAs to HCC remain largely unknown. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> regulatory roles of circRNA Cdr1as in proliferative and migratory abilities of HCC were evaluated by CCK8, EdU, Transwell and tumourigenicity assays, respectively. Results showed circRNA Cdr1as was highly expressed in HCC cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of circRNA Cdr1as greatly accelerated HCC cells to proliferate and migrate. Mechanistically, we found that Cdr1as could promote the expression of AFP, a well-known biomarker for HCC, by sponging miR-1270. Further studies showed exosomes extracted from HCC cells overexpressing circRNA Cdr1as accelerated the proliferative and migratory abilities of surrounding normal cells.

Previous research has shown that the threshold of TPD increases with aging or pathological conditions such as stroke or chronic pain. It has also been reported that the threshold can be decreased by continuous tactile or electrical stimulation. The cognitive process in the cortex has been shown to be involved in the determination of the TPD threshold. However, the reliability of TPD has been questioned, because differences in the firing rate of the responding receptors and afferent fibers occur, depending on how the measuring instrument is applied. To investigate the influence of the stimulus condition on the TPD threshold, we utilized a computer-controlled two-point tactile stimulator and measured the TPD threshold by alternating stimulus speed and stimulus penetration depths. We found that a stimulus speed of 5.0 mm/s or 10.0 mm/s and a stimulus penetration depth of 1.0 mm were the optimum condition for measurement, at which the TPD threshold becomes lowest. We also found that no influence is exerted on the threshold by repeated measurement under the stimulus conditions utilized in this experiment.

When 3 h short-stress of low temperatures (12-0 °C) was given to different stages of D. koenigii, the results revealed that survival rate of all stages were significantly reduced. Survival rate of female was significantly higher than male after exposed to cold temperature stress. Mating percentage, fecundity and hatching percentage were decreased significantly with the decrease of short-term cold temperature stress. Based on these results, we concluded that the developmental duration, survival rate and reproduction of D. koenigii significantly affected when they exposed to short term cold temperature stress.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

DNA methylation is also linked to ageing-the strongest Alzheimer's disease risk factor. DNA methylation age can be calculated using age-related CpGs and might reflect biological ageing. We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50. Targeted sequencing of 80 genes associated with neurodegeneration revealed that the triplets and the affected offspring are heterozygous carriers of the risk APOE ε4 allele, as well as rare substitutions in APP (p.S198P), NOTCH3 (p.H1235L) and SORL1 (p.W1563C). In addition, we catalogued 52 possibly damaging rare variants detected by NeuroX array in affected individuals. Analysis of family members on a genome-wide DNA methylation chip revealed that the DNA methylation age of the triplets was 6-10 years younger than chronological age, while it was 9 years older in the offspring with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting accelerated ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

Despite an increasing availability of drugs to treat COPD, recent data indicate that an actual control of the disease is achieved in a minority of  patients. This makes apparent that additional treatments of COPD should be taken into account, such as pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), which was introduced in the 1960s and has large evidence of clinical effectiveness. PR is a non-pharmacologic therapy based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, patient-centered intervention comprising exercise training, self-management education and psychosocial support. PR treated patients develop an increased exercise tolerance and quality of life, reduced dyspnea and anxiety, and are concerned by less hospital admissions for disease exacerbations. Notwithstanding, the use of PR in COPD patients is negligible, being globally estimated in 2-5%. Here we update the evidence in favor of PR and the actual need to consider it as a treatment to be considered for COPD patients with significant impairment in daily living activities.</AbstractText>"}

We report a unique case of a 22-yr-old woman with a femoral 'trifurcation,' where the origin of the LCFA coincides with the origin of the DFA, resulting in a true three-way branching of the common femoral artery. We characterized the complex hemodynamics of the trifurcation region with ultrasound vector flow imaging at rest, and during 80 mmHg cuff compression of the calf to induce greater oscillatory blood flow. At rest, a clear trifurcation is observed with color Doppler imaging, while vector flow imaging further revealed a large area of flow circulation proximal to the LCFA and DFA. Cuff compression reduced SFA blood flow to 0 cm<sup>3</sup>/min, characterized by almost constant retrograde blood flow throughout diastole. When visualized with vector flow imaging, diastolic retrograde blood flow from the SFA appeared to reperfuse the DFA and LCFA during late systole, eliminating the retrograde flow component and providing a secondary source of anterograde blood flow to the thigh. In a rare case of a femoral trifurcation, we demonstrate blood recirculation patterns at rest, as well as collateral retrograde blood flow redistribution during lower limb compression. While it is unknown whether these trifurcation findings extend to typical bifurcations, it is evident that advanced methods of blood flow characterization are necessary to visualize and study complex vascular regions.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> A femoral 'trifurcation' is observed when the lateral circumflex femoral artery has an atypical proximal origin, branching at the same level as the superficial and deep femoral arteries. Ultrasound vector flow imaging at 750 fps was able to reveal substantial blood recirculation within the trifurcation at rest, as well as unique redistribution of blood flow between downstream branches during external cuff manipulation of retrograde flow, indicating novel ways in which diastolic blood flow is controlled.</AbstractText>"}

In addition, we examined whether individual differences in general mental ability and executive function moderated the associations between age and information use. Participants (<i>N</i> = 96) completed a neuropsychological assessment and the hot (affective) and cold (deliberative) versions of an explicit risk task. Our results did not find a significant Age × Hot/Cold Condition interaction on overall risk-taking. However, we found that older adults were less likely to use the full decision information available regardless of the decision context. This finding suggested more global age differences in information use. Moreover, older adults were less likely to make expected-value sensitive decisions, regardless of the hot/cold context. Finally, we found that low performance on measures of executive functioning, but not general mental ability, appears to be a risk factor for lower information use. This pattern appears in middle age and progressively becomes stronger in older age. The current work provides evidence that common underlying decision processes may operate in risk tasks deemed either affective or deliberative. It further suggests that underlying mechanisms such as information use may be paramount, relative to differences in the affective context. Additionally, individual differences in neuropsychological function may act as a moderator in the tendency to use available information across affective context.

In this work, we have utilized self-assembled block copolymer surfaces to present nanodomains of an adhesive peptide found in many ECM proteins at different lateral spacings (from 30 to 60 nm) and studied the temporal response (2 h to 14 days) of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using a panel of real-time localization and activity biosensors. Our findings revealed that within the first 4 to 24 h postadhesion and spreading, hMSCs on smaller nanodomain spacings recruit more activated FAK and Src proteins to produce larger, longer-lived, and increased numbers of focal adhesions (FAs). The adhesions formed on smaller nanospacings rapidly recruit higher amounts of nonmuscle myosin IIA and vinculin and experience tension forces (by &gt;5 pN/FA) significantly higher than those observed on larger nanodomain spacings. The transmission of higher levels of tension into the cytoskeleton at short times was accompanied by higher Rac1, cytosolic β-catenin, and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and RUNX2, which together biased the commitment of hMSCs to an osteogenic fate. This investigation provides mechanistic insights to confirm that smaller lateral spacings of adhesive nanodomains alter hMSC mechanosensing and biases mechanotransduction at short times <i>via</i> differential coupling of FAK/Src/Rac1/myosin IIA/YAP/TAZ signaling pathways to support longer-term changes in stem cell differentiation and state.</AbstractText>"}

In this review, we discuss recently published brain imaging studies in rats, mice, and monkeys, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), manganese-enhanced MRI, positron emission tomography, and electroencephalography. We provide an overview of innovations and limitations in neuroimaging techniques, as well as results of functional brain imaging studies of pain from January 1, 2016, to October 10, 2018. We then discuss how future investigations can address some bias and gaps in the field. Despite the limitations of neuroimaging techniques, the 28 studies reinforced that transition from acute to chronic pain entails considerable changes in brain function. Brain activations in acute pain were in areas more related to the sensory aspect of noxious stimulation, including primary somatosensory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, thalamus, retrosplenial cortex, and periaqueductal gray. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments modulated these brain regions in several pain models. On the other hand, in chronic pain models, brain activity was observed in regions commonly associated with emotion and motivation, including prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and nucleus accumbens. Neuroimaging of pain in animals holds great promise for advancing our knowledge of brain function and allowing us to expand human subject research. Additional research is needed to address effects of anesthesia, analysis approaches, sex bias and omission, and potential effects of development and aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Our purpose is to analyse possible gender-differential declines of skeletal muscle performance. The method to find out the decline of performances with aging is based on a parametric analysis of the World Records of Master athletes in different Track and Field events. The analysis is a transformation (normalization) of sports results into dimensionless parameters ranging from the maximum value of 1 (for the absolute world record) to decreasing values with decreasing performances. Master athletes compete in age groups of 5 years till the age of 100 years, thus their World Records are lists of up to 16 data. Results of the normalization procedure are trend-lines indicating that the decline starts not later than the age of thirty years for both women and women. The decline with aging of the muscle performances indicates only minor gender differences in the aging process and all trend-lines tend to zero at about the age of 110 years. The approach, making use of a homogeneous cohort of testers, gets rid of the main confounding factors biasing other kind of studies of the muscle performance decline with aging, in particular clinical studies. Comparing normalized female and male World Records of Master athletes, a surprise emerged: aging decline is very similar, if not identical, the unique exception to the general rule of gender differences in sports activities. The substantial identity of decline trends among females and males suggests that neuro-hormonal differences among genders poorly influence the aging decline, being conceivably related to fundamental cell bioregulators, such as those of cellular energy metabolism and/or their epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.</AbstractText>"}

Surgical treatment options targeted at the obstructing prostate are often required to relief the bladder outlet obstruction, following failure or discontinuation of medical therapies. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the mainstay and gold standard for benign prostate surgery for last few decades. Currently with technological advancements, numerous minimally invasive surgical therapies have been employed to provide effective symptom relief while minimalizing morbidities and preserving sexual function. Prostatic hydroablation (Aquablation) is a new technique which involves high velocity water jets used in non-thermal ablation of the obstructing prostatic tissue robotically delivered by a transurethral cystoscopic handpiece and guided by real time transrectal ultrasound imaging. Recent trials have shown that aquablation is safe and effective in the treatment of symptomatic BPH while maintaining sexual preservation.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHOD'>Aquablation using the Aquabeam system (PROCEPT BioRobotics, Redwood Shores, CA, USA) combines the precision of autonomous robotic execution in delivering high velocity waterjets via a cystoscopic handpiece with accurate anatomical prostatic mapping using real time transrectal ultrasound imaging.

An open question has been whether such rejuvenation is possible in whole organisms, especially in mammals. A related key question is whether rejuvenation can be dissociated from dedifferentiation. Several recent reports suggest that one prominent biomarker of mammalian aging, age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) state that has been used to create DNAm age (DNAma) clocks, can be partially reversed by intrinsic treatment of cells with sets of reprogramming factors without affecting cell fate. Partial reprogramming using a superset of reprogramming factors applied transiently or subset of Yamanaka factors applied continually can increase regenerative potential, and reverse DNAma, while maintaining cell identity. Alternatively, a cell-extrinsic manipulation can accomplish something similar. A small preliminary clinical trial in humans suggests that systemic treatment with a cocktail of growth hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and metformin could also partially reverse DNAma and at the same time regenerate the thymus, which shrinks with age. Important questions are raised: How completely does reversing DNAma clocks embody a reversal of other age-related phenotypes, such as functional decline in strength, cognition, or immunity? How universal are these epigenetic changes at the tissue and cell levels? For example, do populations of younger stem cells exist that respond to these manipulations and then only confer the appearance of decreasing DNAma as they proliferate and differentiate? Together, these studies have profound implications for the development of antiaging and healthspan-enhancing therapies. A combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic modalities will most likely provide an optimal benefit.</AbstractText>"}

Young and older adults imagined different person-object-location events with reference to themselves and two famous others (i.e., George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey), rated the likelihood that each event would happen, and then completed incidental memory tests on different pairs of elements within the event. We found that self-reference enhanced memory for object-location and person-object pairs in both age groups. Such self-reference effects were observed consistently only for events rated as likely to happen. There was also an overall memory advantage for the higher-likelihood events, which did not differ between young and older adults. Further, the self-reference effects were not correlated with memory functioning in either age group. Retrieval of within-event associations showed a significant level of dependency, which did not differ as a function of reference condition or likelihood category.

No information is completely certain so only probabilities are considered. Methods of Bayesian inference are used to assess the probability of correctness for each scenario. It is not possible to form a definitive conclusion with the evidence currently available, but we believe that the outcome reinforces earlier suggestions that Mme Calment's age validation is unsafe in the light of recent evidence and should be reviewed. Indicators from DNA analysis that could reliably resolve the question of whether or not an identity switch took place are provided. The methods of Bayesian inference used here could be applied to other longevity validations to improve the validation process for longevity.</AbstractText>"}

Few studies exist to comment on the viability of thumb MP arthroplasty. This study reports both survival and objective outcomes following SMPA of the thumb. <b>Methods:</b> In an institutional review board-approved retrospective study, we identified 18 patients who underwent thumb SMPA at a tertiary academic center by 3 board-certified hand surgeons. Primary outcome measures were implant survival and post-operative complications. Secondary outcomes measures were quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (quickDASH) scores, brief Michigan Hand Questionnaire (bMHQ), and postoperative pain as rated by the numerical rating scale. <b>Results:</b> Mean quickDASH and bMHQ scores at final follow-up were 35.6 and 70.6, respectively. The most common short-term complication was clinical deformity, followed by instability. The sole long-term complication was an implant dislocation in a previously asymptomatic patient. All patients reported reduction in pain. Three patients were indicated for revision surgery, 2 for persistent instability, and 1 for implant dislocation. Primary survivorship was 83% at mean follow-up of 5.8 years. <b>Conclusions:</b> Thumb SMPA is a viable option for end-stage arthritis. Pain relief in our series was unanimous. Among those that reported persistent symptoms or required revision, a majority had one or more key preoperative risk factors for failure as currently reported in literature. Larger, prospective series are needed to prove superior longevity and functional outcomes of thumb SMPA versus fusion.</AbstractText>"}

In chronic viral infections and cancer, where antigens can persistently stimulate the immune system, ICMs can serve as a barrier to effective immune responses. The role of ICMs in the setting of systemic low-grade inflammation as in aging and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed HIV infection is not known. In this study, we made use of stored samples from the FLORAH cohort of HIV-infected ART-suppressed adults (age range 19-77 years.) and age-matched HIV-uninfected controls. We measured the expression levels of ICMs: PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3, and 2B4 on resting CD4 and CD8 T cells and maturation subsets. To determine how expression of these molecules can affect T cell function, we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell with HIV Gag or p09/H1N1 antigen and performed intracellular cytokine staining by multiparameter flow cytometry. ICMs were expressed at higher levels in CD8 compared with CD4. PD-1 was the only molecule that remained significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals compared with controls. LAG-3 expression increased with age in CD4 and CD8 T cells. 2B4 expression on CD8 T cells was negatively associated with IL-2 production but showed no effect on CD4 T cell function. TIM-3 expression was negatively associated with IL-21 production in CD4 and CD8 T cells and also negatively correlated with flu vaccine responses in HIV-negative individuals. Taken altogether, this study demonstrates the marked variation in ICM expression in T cells among adults and sheds light on the biology of these molecules and their effects on antigen-specific T cell functions. Overall, our results point to TIM-3 as a potential biomarker for immune function in HIV<sup>+</sup> individuals on ART.</AbstractText>"}

These results provide promise for the use of lower-leg active compression as a therapeutic tool for individuals vulnerable to initial orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic stress.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='ABSTRACT' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>Intermittent compression of the lower legs provides the possibility of improving orthostatic tolerance by actively promoting venous return and improving central haemodynamics. We tested the hypothesis that intermittent compression of 65 mmHg timed to occur only within the local diastolic phase of each cardiac cycle would attenuate the decrease in blood pressure and improve cerebral haemodynamics during the first minute of recovery from two different orthostatic stress tests. Fourteen subjects (seven female) performed four squat-to-stand transitions and four repeats of standing bilateral thigh-cuff occlusion and release (TCR), with intermittent compression of the lower legs applied in half of the trials. Blood flow in the superficial femoral artery, mean arterial pressure, Doppler ultrasound cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and cerebral tissue saturation index (TSI%) were monitored. With both orthostatic stress tests, there was a significant compression × time interaction for superficial femoral artery flow (P &lt; 0.001). The hypotensive state was attenuated with intermittent compression despite decreased total peripheral resistance (squat-to-stand, compression × time interaction, P &lt; 0.001; TCR, compression × time interaction, P = 0.002) as a consequence of elevated cardiac output in both tests (P &lt; 0.001).

Death from CDB can occur in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, thus the management of CDB is clinically pivotal amid the aging populations in the East and West. Colonoscopy is the key modality for managing the condition appropriately; however, conventional endoscopic hemostasis by thermal coagulation and clipping cannot achieve the expected results of preventing early rebleeding and conversion to intensive intervention by surgery or transcatheter arterial embolization. Ligation therapy by endoscopic band ligation or endoscopic detachable snare ligation has emerged recently to enable more effective hemostasis for CDB, with an early rebleeding rate of approximately 10% and very rare conversion to intensive intervention. Ligation therapy might in turn reduce long-term rebleeding rates by eliminating the target diverticulum itself. Adverse events have been reported with ligation therapy including diverticulitis of the ascending colon in less than 1% of cases and perforation of the sigmoid colon in a few cases, thus more data are necessary to verify the safety of ligation therapy. Endoscopic hemostasis is indicated only for diverticulum with stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH), but the detection rates of SRH are relatively low. Therefore, efforts to increase detection are also key for improving CDB management. Urgent colonoscopy and triage by early contrast-enhanced computed tomography may be candidates to increase detection but further data are necessary in order to make a conclusion.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

While DNA damage and subsequent mutation in somatic cells were first proposed as drivers of aging more than 60 years ago, whether and to what degree these processes shape the neuronal genome in the human brain could not be tested until recent technological breakthroughs related to single-cell whole-genome sequencing. Indeed, somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) increase with age in the human brain, in a somewhat stochastic process that may nonetheless be controlled by underlying genetic programs. Evidence from the literature suggests that in addition to demonstrated increases in somatic SNVs during aging in normal brains, somatic mutation may also play a role in late-onset, sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will discuss somatic mutation in the human brain, mechanisms by which somatic mutations occur and can be controlled, and how this process can impact human health.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

B","Date":"Nov 14 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Photochemical processes offer the possibility of preparing functional hydrogels under green conditions that are compatible with both synthetic and natural polymers. In this study, chitosan-based poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) were successfully synthesized under light irradiation in aqueous medium. Kinetic studies under irradiation showed that less than 2 min were necessary to obtain fully cross-linked networks. Thermomechanical analyses and swelling experiments indicated that introduction of chitosan overall weakens the hydrogel network but can create domains of higher thermal stability than the PEG-alone structure. The resulting chitosan-PEG hydrogels demonstrated a tremendous inhibition (100%) of bacterial growth (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). After 6 months' ageing, one of the hydrogels preserved a high antifouling activity against Escherichia coli. This interesting result, which could be correlated with the network features, demonstrates the strong potential of these photochemical methods to obtain robust bio-functional materials.</AbstractText>"}

We performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of serum urate in 457,690 individuals, identifying 183 loci (147 previously unknown) that improve the prediction of gout in an independent cohort of 334,880 individuals. Serum urate showed significant genetic correlations with many cardiometabolic traits, with genetic causality analyses supporting a substantial role for pleiotropy. Enrichment analysis, fine-mapping of urate-associated loci and colocalization with gene expression in 47 tissues implicated the kidney and liver as the main target organs and prioritized potentially causal genes and variants, including the transcriptional master regulators in the liver and kidney, HNF1A and HNF4A. Experimental validation showed that HNF4A transactivated the promoter of ABCG2, encoding a major urate transporter, in kidney cells, and that HNF4A p.Thr139Ile is a functional variant. Transcriptional coregulation within and across organs may be a general mechanism underlying the observed pleiotropy between urate and cardiometabolic traits.</AbstractText>"}

While the YEATS domain has been found to be a prominent reader of acetylation and other short acyl modifications, whether additional acyl-lysine reader domains exist, particularly for longer carbon chains, is unclear. Here, we employed a quantitative proteomic approach using various modified peptide baits to identify reader proteins of various acyl modifications. We discovered that proteins harboring HEAT and ARM repeats bind to lysine myristoylated peptides. Recombinant HEAT and ARM repeats bind to myristoylated peptides independent of the peptide sequence or the position of the myristoyl group. Indeed, HEAT and ARM repeats bind directly to medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (MCFA and LCFA). Lipidomic experiments suggest that MCFAs and LCFAs interact with HEAT and ARM repeat proteins in mammalian cells. Finally, treatment of cells with exogenous MCFAs and inhibitors of MCFA-CoA synthases increase the transactivation activity of the ARM repeat protein β-catenin. Taken together, our results suggest an unappreciated role for fatty acids in the regulation of proteins harboring HEAT or ARM repeats.</AbstractText>"}

Still nowadays, its pathogenesis is unclear. 35 consecutive patients with SVD at brain MRI and 35 age- and sex-matched controls, between January 2016 and February 2018, underwent an extended screening for thrombophilia, autoimmunity and evaluated levels of blood markers of inflammation and endothelial activation. Asymmetric DiMethyl Arginine (ADMA) levels proved higher in patients (70.44 ± 36.25 ng/ml vs. 46.58 ± 30.67 ng/ml; p = 0.004), also after controlling for confounding factors. ADMA levels showed positive correlation with Fazekas score (r = 0.304; p = 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed a moderate accuracy in discriminating patients and controls (AUC = 0.70; CI 0.57-0.82; p = 0.004): a cut-off of 46 ng/ml is associated with 80% sensitivity, but limited (54%) specificity. Higher ADMA levels characterize selected subjects with sporadic SVD, asymptomatic for vascular diseases and without latent inflammatory conditions or coagulopathy. This reinforces the hypothesis of the key role of endothelial dysfunction in SVD. Further studies should explore the cause-effect relationship between ADMA pathway and SVD.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies indicate that the immune system contributes to the yak's adaptation to high-altitude environments. In order to further investigate changes in immune function during yak development, we compared the transcriptome profiles of gluteus and lung tissues among yaks at 6, 30, 60, and 90 months of age. Analyses of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung tissues revealed that immune function was more activated at 6-months and less activated at 90-months than in the 30 and 60-month-old animals. DEG exploration in gluteal tissues revealed that immune functions were more highly activated at both 6 and 90-months, compared with 30 and 60-months. Immune system activation in the muscle and lung tissues of 30-month-old yaks may increase their resistance to infections, while decreased may be due to aging. Furthermore, the higher immune activation status in the gluteal tissues in 90-month-old yaks could be due to muscle injury and subsequent regeneration, which is supported by the fact that 5 unigenes related with muscle injury and 3 related to muscle regeneration displayed greater expression levels at 90-months than at 30 and 60-months. Overall, the present study highlights the important role of the immune system in yak development, which will facilitate future investigations.</AbstractText>"}

Suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins, particularly SOCS2, have recently been described as antiinflammatory mediators. However, the regulation of SOCS2 protein has not been described. Here we describe a mechanism of SOCS2 regulation by the action of the ubiquitin E3 ligase KIAA0317. KIAA0317-mediated degradation of SOCS2 exacerbated inflammation in vitro, and depletion of KIAA0317 in vivo ameliorated pulmonary inflammation. KIAA0317-knockout mice exhibited resistance to LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation, while KIAA03017 reexpression mitigated this effect. We uncovered a small molecule inhibitor of KIAA0317 protein (BC-1365) that prevented SOCS2 degradation and attenuated LPS- and P. aeruginosa-induced lung inflammation in vivo. These studies show KIAA0317 to be a critical mediator of pulmonary inflammation through its degradation of SOCS2 and a potential candidate target for therapeutic inhibition.</AbstractText>"}

Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are broadly viewed as protective molecules that prevent the mutagenic effects of reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants may, however, increase the risk of some forms of cancer and accelerate lung cancer progression in murine models. Here, we investigated chronic NAC treatment in aging mice displaying lung oxidative stress and cell senescence due to inactivation of the transcription factor JunD, which is downregulated in diseased human lungs. NAC treatment decreased lung oxidative damage and cell senescence and protected from lung emphysema but concomitantly induced the development of lung adenocarcinoma in 50% of JunD-deficient mice and 10% of aged control mice. This finding constitutes the first evidence to our knowledge of a carcinogenic effect of antioxidant therapy in the lungs of aged mice with chronic lung oxidative stress and warrants the utmost caution when considering the therapeutic use of antioxidants.</AbstractText>"}

Deletion of RelB in DCs further results in an impaired oral tolerance induction and a marked type 2 immune bias among accumulated Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs reminiscent of a tissue Treg signature. Tissue Tregs were fully functional, expanded independently of IL-33, and led to an almost complete Treg-dependent protection from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The optimal clinical management of IPF is multifaceted and not only involves antifibrotic treatment, but also vaccinations, oxygen supplementation, evaluation of nutritional status as well as psychological support and patient education. Symptom management, pulmonary rehabilitation, palliative care and treatment of comorbidities represent further areas of clinical intervention. This review analyses the major comorbidities observed in IPF, focusing on those that have the greatest impact on mortality and quality of life (QoL).

Results showed that PAM hydrogel at a ratio of Bis/Acr = 1:50 (Acr-50) owned the highest cross-linking density (0.04), which provided abundant binding sites for cell adhesion and allowed for rapid cell proliferation. On the basis of the binding sites, cells had strong traction interaction from fibrillate adhesion with the polymers, allowed easy cell migration, and induced the living cell aggregations with a diameter of 800 μm. Cells in aggregation exhibited healthy cell phenotypes and functions, and also the mitosis of the cells in aggregation is exactly the same with the cells in tissue.

The best way to reach this goal is to clarify the mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of AD. In the last few years the views about the drivers of AD have been changing and nowadays it is believed that neuroinflammation takes center stage in disease pathogenesis. Herein, we provide an overview about the role of neuroinflammation in AD describing the role of microglia and astroglia is this process. Then, we will debate the NLRP3 inflammasome putting the focus on its activation through the canonical, non-canonical and alternative pathways and the triggers involved herein namely endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and amyloid β peptide. Data supporting the hypothesis that inflammasome-mediated peripheral inflammation may contribute to AD pathology will be presented. Finally, a brief discussion about the therapeutic potential of NLRP3 inflammasome modulation is also provided.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In mammals, a broadly conserved metabolic effect of CR is improved insulin sensitivity, which may mediate the beneficial effects of a CR diet. This model has been challenged by the identification of interventions that extend lifespan and healthspan yet promote insulin resistance. These include rapamycin, which extends mouse lifespan yet induces insulin resistance by disrupting mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2). Here, we induce insulin resistance by genetically disrupting adipose mTORC2 via tissue-specific deletion of the mTORC2 component Rictor (AQ-RKO). Loss of adipose mTORC2 blunts the metabolic adaptation to CR and prevents whole-body sensitization to insulin. Despite this, AQ-RKO mice subject to CR experience the same increase in fitness and lifespan on a CR diet as wild-type mice. We conclude that the CR-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity is dispensable for the effects of CR on fitness and longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, we report that melanoma patients with high expression of glycolysis-related genes show a worse progression free survival upon anti-PD1 treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac lowers lactate secretion of tumor cells and improves anti-PD1-induced T cell killing in vitro. Surprisingly, diclofenac, but not other NSAIDs, turns out to be a potent inhibitor of the lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 and diminishes lactate efflux. Notably, T cell activation, viability, and effector functions are preserved under diclofenac treatment and in a low glucose environment in vitro. Diclofenac, but not aspirin, delays tumor growth and improves the efficacy of checkpoint therapy in vivo. Moreover, genetic suppression of glycolysis in tumor cells strongly improves checkpoint therapy. These findings support the rationale for targeting glycolysis in patients with high glycolytic tumors together with checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty acid oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Of 255 frail patients, 179 (70.2%) were women, and frail patients were significantly older than nonfrail patients (mean [SD], 79.2 [12.1] years vs 66.2 [11.9] years, respectively; P &lt; .001). The percentages of frail patients presenting to the hospital with a history of falls and readmitted for falls after index admission were higher than those of nonfrail patients (63 [24.8%] vs 53 [9.6%] and 55 [21.6%] vs 58 [10.6%], respectively; both P &lt; .001). Frailty was associated with discharge to the home with health care (odds ratio [OR], 4.82; 95% CI, 2.10-11.01; P &lt; .001), to a skilled nursing facility (OR, 5.47; 95% CI, 3.40-8.80; P &lt; .001), and to a hospice care facility (OR, 8.47; 95% CI, 2.09-34.42; P = .003) compared with discharge to the home with self-care. Frailty was also associated with readmission for falls after index admission (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.39-3.66; P = .001) and the number of falls within 1 year after index admission (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-1.67; P = .02) compared with nonfrailty. The frailty analysis was controlled for age, body mass index, sex, and falls at index admission.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Conclusions and Relevance' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>Measurement of frailty at hospital admission may be an effective tool to assess fall risk and discharge disposition among patients with trauma-related injury aged 50 years and older.</AbstractText>"}

Dietary consumption of food supplements has been found to modulate skin functions and can be useful in the prevention of skin aging. To evaluate the effect of walnut protein hydrolysate (WPH) on photoaged skin, Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats) were orally administered with WPH and then were regularly exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). After a consecutive UV-R for 18 weeks, the delaying efficiency of WPH against elasticity degradation was examined and the mechanical mechanism was explored subsequently. The contents of hydroxyproline (Hyp) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) were measured by biochemical reactions and color rendering procedures; the levels of types I and III collagen (Col I and III) and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the protein levels of elastin and fibrillin-1 were examined by western blotting. Moreover, the histological change in the skin structure was illustrated by hematoxylin &amp; eosin (HE) and Masson staining. The results revealed that WPH evidently enhanced the elasticity of photoaged skin and stimulated the biosynthesis of ECM components Col I, Hyp and HA in the dermal layer; meanwhile WPH inhibited the MMP-1 activity, alleviated epidermal hyperplasia, and repaired the damaged skin mechanical structure in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, in comparison with the UV-R group, the WPH group in which WPH was administered at a high-dose level showed significantly improved skin appearance, ECM components and structure (P &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the elasticity improvement caused by WPH against the skin photoaging process can be attributed to the regulation of the metabolism of the components and repair of the damaged mechanical structure of the ECM. This research proved the potential of WPH as a functional ingredient for the development of anti-photoaging foods.</AbstractText>"}

Young and older adults performed two tasks: verbal estimation and walking. We used holes of different lengths and constant depth (12 cm). In the verbal estimation task, participants stood and looked at each hole and verbally respond if they would step into or avoid it. In the walking task, they walked and chose to either step or avoid the hole. Both age groups preferred to step into the hole when it was larger than 1.3 times their foot length in both tasks. The perception of affordances of young and older adults to step into a hole was similar, and it was unaffected by the investigated tasks. Thus, our participants preferred to have a safety margin that was large enough to guarantee that the whole foot would accommodate within the hole.</AbstractText>"}

We recently developed a novel procedure based on sialic acid linkage-specific alkylamidation via lactone ring opening (aminolysis-SALSA). Herein, we have investigated an isotope labeling of α2,3-linked sialic acid residues (iSALSA) using amine hydrochloride salts. One limitation of SALSA using amine hydrochloride salts may be solved by adding only <i>tert</i>-butylamine (t-BA) as an acid scavenger, and comparative and quantitative glycomic analyses can be performed using iSALSA. We also developed quantitative glycomic analysis using dual isotope-labeled glycans by derivatizing with aminooxy-functionalized tryptophanylarginine methyl ester (aoWR) and iSALSA at the reducing and nonreducing end, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the amount of α2,3-linked sialoglycans in serum are altered during liver fibrosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography MS (LC/MS) analyses. We revealed that the ratio of A3<sub>3,6,6</sub> to A3F<sub>3,6,6</sub> was gradually decreased along with liver fibrosis progression.

Ion molecular reaction-mass spectrometry was applied to determine NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations at a time resolution of 0.6 s. Catalyst aging was shown to result in a significant increase in the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> formed, which has received limited attention in the literature to date. The selectivity toward NH<sub>3</sub> formation has been shown to increase with the decrease in the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of a TWC induced by thermal aging. NH<sub>3</sub> has been shown to mainly form within the exhaust temperature range of 250-550 °C. Typical lambda and rich operational condition duration periods found in vehicle test procedures were also employed to investigate their effects on NH<sub>3</sub> formation. The results suggest that a decrease in the lambda and/or an increase in the duration of rich operating conditions will lead to an increase in the selectivity toward NH<sub>3</sub> formation. Improving the OSC of TWCs and effectively controlling the lambda near to 1.0 with limited duration in rich operating conditions are therefore significant factors in the reduction of NH<sub>3</sub> emissions.</AbstractText>"}

Surface modification of cathode-active materials by organic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has emerged as an approach to improve the longevity of high-voltage electrodes; however, the surface chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interphase and its dependence on monolayer structure remains unclear. Herein, we investigate the interplay between monolayer structure, electrochemical performance, and surface chemistry of high-voltage LiMn<sub>1.5</sub>Ni<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LMNO) electrodes by the application of silane-based SAMs of variable length and chemical composition. We demonstrate that the application of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic monolayers results in improved galvanostatic capacity retention relative to unmodified LMNO. The extent of this improvement is tied to the structure of the monolayer with fluorinated alkyl-silanes exhibiting the greatest overall capacity retention, above 96% after 100 charge/discharge cycles. Postmortem surface analysis reveals that the presence of the monolayer enhances the deposition of LiF at the electrode surface during cell cycling and that the total surface concentration correlates with the overall improvements in capacity retention. We propose that the enhanced deposition of highly insulating LiF increases the anodic stability of the interphase, contributing to the improved galvanostatic performance of modified electrodes. Moreover, this work demonstrates that the modification of the electrode surface by the selection of an appropriate monolayer is an effective approach to tune the properties and behavior of the electrode/electrolyte interphase formed during battery operation.</AbstractText>"}

We aimed to identify novel and modifiable risk factors for prehospital delay. Methods and Results We included patients with an ischemic stroke confirmed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, symptom onset within 24 hours and hospitalized in the Stroke Center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Trained study nurses interviewed patients and proxies along a standardized questionnaire. Prehospital delay was defined as &gt;4.5 hours between stroke onset-or time point of wake-up-and admission. Overall, 336 patients were enrolled. Prehospital delay was observed in 140 patients (42%). The first healthcare professionals to be alarmed were family doctors for 29% of patients (97/336), and a quarter of these patients had a baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of 4 or higher. The main modifiable risk factor for prehospital delay was a face-to-face visit to the family doctor (adjusted odds ratio, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.85-9.46). Despite transport by emergency medical services being associated with less prehospital delay (adjusted odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.71), a minority of patients (39%) who first called their family doctor were transported by emergency medical services to the hospital. The second risk factor was lack of awareness of stroke symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, 4.14; 95% CI, 2.36-7.24). Conclusions Almost 1 in 3 patients with a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke first called the family doctor practice. Face-to-face visits to the family doctor quadrupled the odds of prehospital delay. Efforts to reduce prehospital delay should address family doctors and their staffs as important partners in the prehospital pathway. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

With timely lifestyle modification such as behavioral changes, implementation of a healthy diet, and proper physical activity, many of these diseases can be prevented. Weight gain is one of the major health concerns of midlife. Midlife body changes are the result of aging, menopause, and other influences unique to menopausal women which interfere with adoption of a healthy lifestyle. Reduced metabolism levels lead to low energy levels, which discourage physical activity. In addition, with the onset of bone loss, menopausal women begin to lose muscle mass and gain more fat, resulting in osteopenic sarco-obesity. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle is a first-line option in the treatment for these midlife changes. Lifestyle medicine offers a broad set of network-based interventions, which need to be brought to the forefront in preventing and managing obesity at all stages.

As wearable technologies advance for the monitoring of human health, it may be instructive to reflect on the successes and failures of biologging in field biology over the past few decades. Several lessons may be of value. Physiological sensors can 'encode' for a wider number of states than the one explicitly targeted, although the limits of this are debatable. The combination of orthogonal sensors turns out to be critical to delivering a high value data set. Sensor fusion and engineering for longevity are also important for success.

This study describes adverse effects of GO and amino-functionalized GO (GONH<sub>2</sub> ) during Caenorhabditis elegans development and ageing upon acute or chronic exposure. Chronic GO treatment throughout the C. elegans development causes decreased fecundity and a reduction of animal size, while acute treatment does not lead to any measurable physiological decline. However, RNA-Sequencing data reveal that acute GO exposure induces innate immune gene expression. The p38 MAP kinase, PMK-1, which is a well-established master regulator of innate immunity, protects C. elegans from chronic GO toxicity, as pmk-1 mutants show reduced tissue-functionality and facultative vivipary. In a direct comparison, GONH<sub>2</sub> exposure does not cause detrimental effects in the wild type or in pmk-1 mutants, and the innate immune response is considerably less pronounced. This work establishes enhanced biocompatibility of amino-functionalized GO in a whole-organism, emphasizing its potential as a biomedical nanomaterial.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Nevertheless, subsets of aggregation-prone proteins form toxic aggregates (proteotoxicity) that in some cases, underlie the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Proteotoxic aggregates are often deposited in the vicinity of the nucleus, a process that is cytoskeleton-dependent. Accordingly, cytoskeletal dysfunction contributes to pathological hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we asked whether the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which bridges these filaments across the nuclear envelope, is needed for the maintenance of proteostasis. Employing model nematodes, we discovered that knocking down LINC components impairs the ability of the worm to cope with proteotoxicity. Knocking down anc-1, which encodes a key component of the LINC complex, modulates the expression of transcription factors and E3 ubiquitin ligases, thereby affecting the rates of protein ubiquitination and impairing proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Our results establish a link between the LINC complex, protein degradation, and neurodegeneration-associated proteotoxicity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Peak bone mass may occur at different ages in different skeletal sites and varies between sexes. Accelerated loss of bone occurs in the perimenopausal period in women, whereas more gradual but progressive loss of bone occurs in aging men. Changes in bone quality as well as bone quantity occur during growth and subsequent aging. These include changes in bone microarchitecture which may differ between cortical and trabecular compartments and in different sites, and may impact on bone size and geometry. Changes in material properties of bone matrix may also occur with aging. Loss of bone quantity and altered bone quality with aging may weaken bones and culminate in osteoporosis with an increased risk of fractures. Both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms may predispose to osteoporosis. Cellular and molecular events underlie the alterations in bone quantity and quality. Osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation, tightly regulated by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, are organized in coordinated activities resulting in remodeling and modeling. Malignancies, and anti-neoplastic therapies, may impact on the cellular and molecular events in the aging skeleton and produce focal or diffuse skeletal lesions and fractures.</AbstractText>"}

Due to their similar length scale, microfluidic chips have been extensively explored for use in various biological studies involving C. elegans. However, a formidable challenge still exists due to the complexity of integrating external stimuli (chemical, mechanical or optical) with free-moving worms and subsequent imaging on the chip. In this report, we use a microfluidic device to partially immobilize a worm, which allows for measurements of the relative changes in the thrashing force under different assay conditions. Using a device adapted to the natural escape-like coiling response of a worm to immobilization, we have quantified the relative changes in the thrashing force during different developmental stages (L1, L3, L4, and young adult) and in response to various glucose concentrations and drug treatment. Our findings showed a loss of thrashing force following the introduction of glucose into a wild type worm culture that could be reversed upon treatment with the type 2 diabetes drug metformin. A morphological study of the actin filament structures in the body wall muscles provided supporting evidence for the force measurement data. Finally, we demonstrated the multiplexing capabilities of our device through recording the thrashing activities of eight worms simultaneously. The multiplexing capabilities and facile imaging available using our device open the door for high-throughput neuromuscular studies using C. elegans.</AbstractText>"}

Non-APL AMLs are resistant to ATRA. Here we demonstrate that the acetyltransferase GCN5 contributes to ATRA resistance in non-APL AML via aberrant acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) residues maintaining the expression of stemness and leukemia associated genes. We show that inhibition of GCN5 unlocks an ATRA-driven therapeutic response. This response is potentiated by coinhibition of the lysine demethylase LSD1, leading to differentiation in most non-APL AML. Induction of differentiation was not correlated to a specific AML subtype, cytogenetic, or mutational status. Our study shows a previously uncharacterized role of GCN5 in maintaining the immature state of leukemic blasts and identifies GCN5 as a therapeutic target in AML. The high efficacy of the combined epigenetic treatment with GCN5 and LSD1 inhibitors may enable the use of ATRA for differentiation therapy of non-APL AML. Furthermore, it supports a strategy of combined targeting of epigenetic factors to improve treatment, a concept potentially applicable for a broad range of malignancies.</AbstractText>"}

Saa3 promoter activity is specifically upregulated in parallel with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and fibrotic marker collagen I in injured kidneys. C/EBPβ, upregulated in injured kidneys and expressed in tubular epithelial cells, is essential for the increased Saa3 promoter activity in response to TNF-α, suggesting that C/EBPβ plays a crucial role in renal fibrosis development.

Thus, we investigated the effect of vitamin D3 on the expression of testicular proliferation markers, apoptotic markers, antioxidants system and oxidative stress in a D-gal-induced aged rat model. The present study investigated the levels of vitamin D3 and AGE in serum and testes along with the expression of the AGE-receptor (AGER) in the testis. Vitamin D3 treatment significantly increases cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis in a D-gal-induced aged rat testis. Furthermore, vitamin D3 significantly decreases oxidative stress in aged rat testis by improving the antioxidant defense systems. The expression of AGER was down-regulated by vitamin D3 treatment in aged testis. The circulating and intra-testicular AGE was higher in aged groups, however, only circulating vitamin D3 levels decreased in aged groups.

Recent studies have demonstrated that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are able to mimic MSCs in alleviating acute lung injury. The goals of this study were to determine whether EVs from young and aging MSCs had differential effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury in young mice and unravel the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that both aging and young MSC-EVs had similar physical and phenotypical properties. As their parental cells, young MSC-EVs alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury, while aging MSC-EVs did not exhibit the protective effects. In contrast to young MSC-EVs, aging MSC-EVs failed to alter macrophage phenotypes and reduce macrophage recruitment. In addition, the internalization of aging MSC-EVs by macrophages was significantly lower compared with that of young MSC-EVs. Furthermore, aging and young MSC-EVs differed in levels of several miRNAs relating macrophage polarization. In conclusion, aging and young MSC-EVs have differential effects in alleviating acute lung injury and macrophage polarization, which may be associated with internalization of EVs and their miRNA content.</AbstractText>"}

Although senescence has long been linked with aging, recent studies have uncovered functional roles for senescence in embryonic development, regeneration and reprogramming, and have helped to advance our understanding of this process as a highly coordinated and programmed cellular state. In this Primer article, we summarize some of the key findings in the field and attempt to explain them in a simple model that reconciles the normal and pathological roles for senescence. We discuss how a primary role of cellular senescence is to contribute to normal development, cell plasticity and tissue repair, as a dynamic and tightly regulated cellular program. However, when this process is perturbed, the beneficial effects turn detrimental and can contribute to disease and aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

Here, we report that emigration is shifted to earlier B-cell stages in mice with orthotopic breast cancer, spontaneous ovarian cancer, and possibly in human breast carcinoma. Using mouse and human bone marrow aspirates and mouse models challenged with highly metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that this was the result of secretion of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) by cancer cells. First, TSLP downregulated surface expression of bone marrow (BM) retention receptors CXCR4 and VLA4 in B-cell precursors, increasing their motility and, presumably, emigration. Then, TSLP supported peripheral survival and proliferation of BM B-cell precursors such as pre-B-like cells. 4T1 cancer cells used the increased pool of circulating pre-B-like cells to generate metastasis-supporting regulatory B cells. As such, the loss of TSLP expression in cancer cells alone or TSLPR deficiency in B cells blocked both accumulation of pre-B-like cells in circulation and cancer metastasis, implying that the pre-B cell-TSLP axis can be an attractive therapeutic target.

It acts as a critical co-factor of many enzymes that play key roles in diverse cellular processes. The present study attempts to investigate the regulatory functions decisively controlling copper trafficking during development and aging of the <i>Drosophila</i> model system. Hence, through engagement of the GAL4/UAS genetic platform and RNAi technology, we herein examined the <i>in vivo</i> significance of <i>Atox1</i> and <i>CCS</i> genes, products of which pivotally govern cellular copper trafficking in fly tissue pathophysiology. Specifically, we analyzed the systemic effects of their targeted downregulation on the eye, wing, neuronal cell populations and whole-body tissues of the fly. Our results reveal that, in contrast to the eye, suppression of their expression in the wing leads to a notable increase in the percentage of malformed organs observed. Furthermore, we show that <i>Atox1</i> or <i>CCS</i> gene silencing in either neuronal or whole-body tissues can critically affect the viability and climbing capacity of transgenic flies, while their double-genetic targeting suggests a rather synergistic mode of action of the cognate protein products. Interestingly, pharmacological intervention with the anti-cancer drug cisplatin indicates the major contribution of CCS copper chaperone to cisplatin's cellular trafficking, and presumably to tumor resistance often acquired during chemotherapy. Altogether, it seems that Atox1 and CCS proteins serve as tissue/organ-specific principal regulators of physiological <i>Drosophila</i> development and aging, while their tissue-dependent downregulation can provide important insights for <i>Atox1</i> and <i>CCS</i> potential exploitation as predictive gene biomarkers of cancer-cell chemotherapy responses.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

We surveyed clinical outcomes of MRSA pneumonia in daily practice to identify risk factors for the clinical failure and mortality in patients with MRSA pneumonia. This multicenter prospective observational study was performed across 48 Japanese medical institutions. Adult patients with culture-positive MRSA pneumonia were recruited and treated with anti-MRSA antibiotics. The relationships between clinical and microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes at test of cure (TOC) or 30-day all-cause mortality were analyzed. In total, 199 eligible patients, including nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (n = 95), hospital-acquired pneumonia (n = 76), and community-acquired pneumonia (n = 25), received initial treatment with anti-MRSA agents such as vancomycin (n = 135), linezolid (n = 36), or teicoplanin (n = 22). Overall clinical failure rate at TOC and the 30-day mortality rate were 51.1% (48/94 patients) and 33.7% (66/196 patients), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses for vancomycin-treated populations revealed that abnormal white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 4.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-14.39) was a risk factor for clinical failure and that no therapeutic drug monitoring (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.35-7.12) and abnormally high C-reactive protein level (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.26-9.92) were risk factors for mortality.

Biological sciences","Date":"Oct 09 2019","Keywords":"Lansing effect, maternal age, maternal effects, stress, telomere length","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Offspring produced by older parents often have reduced longevity, termed the Lansing effect. Because adults usually have similar-aged mates, it is difficult to separate effects of maternal and paternal age, and environmental circumstances are also likely to influence offspring outcomes. The mechanisms underlying the Lansing effect are poorly understood. Variation in telomere length and loss, particularly in early life, is linked to longevity in many vertebrates, and therefore changes in offspring telomere dynamics could be very important in this context. We examined the effect of maternal age and environment on offspring telomere length in zebra finches. We kept mothers under either control (ad libitum food) or more challenging (unpredictable food) circumstances and experimentally minimized paternal age and mate choice effects. Irrespective of the maternal environment, there was a substantial negative effect of maternal age on offspring telomere length, evident in longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons (average of 39% shorter). Furthermore, in young mothers, sons reared by challenged mothers had significantly shorter telomere lengths than sons reared by control mothers. This effect disappeared when the mothers were old, and was absent in daughters. These findings highlight the importance of telomere dynamics as inter-generational mediators of the evolutionary processes determining optimal age-specific reproductive effort and sex allocation.</AbstractText>"}

Valence-restricted patchy particles have long served as one archetypal example of such materials, but equilibrium gels can also be realized through a synthetically simpler and scalable strategy that introduces a secondary linker, such as a small ditopic molecule, to mediate the bonds between the colloids. Here, we consider the case where the ditopic linker molecules are low-molecular-weight polymers and demonstrate using a model colloid-polymer mixture how macroscopic properties such as the phase behavior as well as the microstructure of the gel can be designed through the polymer molecular weight and concentration. The low-density window for equilibrium gel formation is favorably expanded using longer linkers while necessarily increasing the spacing between all colloids. However, we show that blends of linkers with different sizes enable wider variation in microstructure for a given target phase behavior. Our computational study suggests a robust and tunable strategy for the experimental realization of equilibrium colloidal gels.</AbstractText>"}

Medical insurance is a major source of Chinese medical financing and payment. The study aims to understand the current status of medical expenses for older adults and explore the effect of different types of health insurance on medical expenses in China.The data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2014. The Kruskal-Wallis test and general multivariate linear regression model were applied to analyze the current situation and to explore how medical insurance as the main payment impacts medical expenses.A total of 4376 older participants were included in this study. The median of medical expenses of a total was 1500 Yuan per year. The proportions of participants who had the urban employee-based basic medical insurance (UE-BMI), the urban residents basic medical insurance (UR-BMI), the new rural cooperative medical insurance scheme (NCMS), and the commercial medical insurance were 10.8%, 8.4%, 72.7%, and 0.9%, respectively. 34.8% of older adults paid the health care service via the NCMS and 11.9% paid via the UE-BMI. Participating in the NCMS and UR-BMI are significantly related to the level of the medical fees of older adults. UE-BMI, UR-BMI, and NCMS as main payment eased the pressure of medical expenses.The influence of different types of medical insurances as main payments on the medical expenses of older adults is varied. Implementation of medical insurance should be taken to further relieve the medical expenses of older adults.</AbstractText>"}

E","Date":"Aug 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>In this paper we explore the evolution of transport capacity on networks with stochastic incidence of damage and accumulation of faults in their connections. For each damaged configuration of the network, we analyze a Markovian random walker that hops over weighted links that quantify the capacity of transport of each connection. The weights of the links in the network evolve due to randomly occurring damage effects that reduce gradually the transport capacity of the structure. We introduce a global measure to determine the functionality of each configuration and how the system ages due to the accumulation of damage that cannot be repaired completely. Then, by assuming a minimum value of the functionality required for the system to be 'alive,' we explore the statistics of the lifetimes for several realizations of this process in different types of networks. Finally, we analyze the characteristic longevity of such a system and its relation with the 'complexity' of the network structure. One finding is that systems with greater complexity live longer. Our approach introduces a model of aging processes relating the reduction of functionality with the accumulation of 'misrepairs' and the lifetime of a complex system.</AbstractText>"}

BFCNs depend for their survival and function on nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are retrogradely transported from BFCN targets. Age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD, yet the influence of age on BFCN axonal transport is poorly understood. To model aging, embryonic rat basal forebrain or cortical neurons were cultured in microfluidic chambers. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining indicated an aging phenotype only in BFCNs cultured for 18+ days in vitro. BDNF axonal transport impairments were observed exclusivley in aged BFCNs. BFCNs displayed robust proNGF transport, which also diminished with in vitro age. The expression of NGF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase-A and BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase-B also decreased significantly with in vitro age in BFCNs only. These results suggest a unique vulnerability of BFCNs to age-induced transport deficits. These deficits, coupled with the reliance of BFCNs on neurotrophin transport, may explain their vulnerability to age-related neurodegenerative disorders like AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Bioactive peptides have a wide spectrum of bioactivities, which make them ideal candidates for development of these cosmeceutical products. In vitro studies have demonstrated that bioactive peptides (obtained as extracts, hydrolysates, and/or individual peptides) exhibit biological properties including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities, in addition to their properties of inhibiting aging-related enzymes such as elastase, collagenase, tyrosinase and hyaluronidase. Some studies report multifunctional bioactive peptides that can simultaneously affect, beneficially, multiple physiological pathways in the skin. Moreover, in vivo studies have revealed that topical application or consumption of bioactive peptides possess remarkable skin protection. These properties suggest that bioactive peptides may contribute in the improvement of skin health by providing specific physiological functions, even though the mechanisms underlying the protective effect have not been completely elucidated.

An understanding of this female longevity advantage will likely uncover novel anti-aging therapeutic targets. Here we investigated the transcriptomic responses in the hypothalamus - a key organ for somatic aging control - to the introduction of a simple aging-related molecular perturbation, i.e. GIT2 heterozygosity. Our previous work has demonstrated that GIT2 acts as a network controller of aging. A similar number of both total (1079-female, 1006-male) and gender-unique (577-female, 527-male) transcripts were significantly altered in response to GIT2 heterozygosity in early life-stage (2 month-old) mice. Despite a similar volume of transcriptomic disruption in females and males, a considerably stronger dataset coherency and functional annotation representation was observed for females. It was also evident that female mice possessed a greater resilience to pro-aging signaling pathways compared to males. Using a highly data-dependent natural language processing informatics pipeline, we identified novel functional data clusters that were connected by a coherent group of multifunctional transcripts. From these it was clear that females prioritized metabolic activity preservation compared to males to mitigate this pro-aging perturbation. These findings were corroborated by somatic metabolism analyses of living animals, demonstrating the efficacy of our new informatics pipeline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Crown Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, in the presence of calcium ions, PS lipids can induce membrane fusion and phase separation. Molecular details of these phenomena remain poorly understood, partly because accurate models to interpret the experimental data have not been available. Here we gather a set of previously published experimental NMR data of C-H bond order parameter magnitudes, |<i>S</i><sub>CH</sub>|, for pure PS and mixed PS:PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipid bilayers and augment this data set by measuring the signs of <i>S</i><sub>CH</sub> in the PS headgroup using S-DROSS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The augmented data set is then used to assess the accuracy of the PS headgroup structures in, and the cation binding to, PS-containing membranes in the most commonly used classical molecular dynamics (MD) force fields including CHARMM36, Lipid17, MacRog, Slipids, GROMOS-CKP, Berger, and variants. We show large discrepancies between different force fields and that none of them reproduces the NMR data within experimental accuracy. However, the best MD models can detect the most essential differences between PC and PS headgroup structures. The cation binding affinity is not captured correctly by any of the PS force fields-an observation that is in line with our previous results for PC lipids. Moreover, the simulated response of the PS headgroup to bound ions can differ from experiments even <i>qualitatively</i>. The collected experimental data set and simulation results will pave the way for development of lipid force fields that correctly describe the biologically relevant negatively charged membranes and their interactions with ions.

Biometrische Zeitschrift","Date":"Jan 2020","Keywords":"Bayesian inference, frailty, individual heterogeneity, mortality, survival analysis","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Today, we know that demographic rates can be greatly influenced by differences among individuals in their capacity to survive and reproduce. These intrinsic differences, commonly known as individual heterogeneity, can rarely be measured and are thus treated as latent variables when modeling mortality. Finite mixture models and mixed effects models have been proposed as alternative approaches for inference on individual heterogeneity in mortality. However, in general models assume that individual heterogeneity influences mortality proportionally, which limits the possibility to test hypotheses on the effect of individual heterogeneity on other aspects of mortality such as ageing rates. Here, we propose a Bayesian model that builds upon the mixture models previously developed, but that facilitates making inferences on the effect of individual heterogeneity on mortality parameters other than the baseline mortality. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the Gompertz-Makeham mortality model, commonly used in human and wildlife studies, by assuming that the Gompertz rate parameter is affected by individual heterogeneity. We provide results of a simulation study where we show that the model appropriately retrieves the parameters used for simulation, even for low variances in the heterogeneous parameter. We then apply the model to a dataset on captive chimpanzees and on a cohort life table of 1751 Swedish men, and show how model selection against a null model (i.e., without heterogeneity) can be carried out.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Expression of the co-inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 was significantly lower in older CD4 T cells, whereas expression of HLA-DR, CD38, CD57, and PD-1 were not significantly different between groups. Total CD4 T cell frequencies were similar between age groups, but lower frequencies and numbers of Th17 cells were observed directly ex vivo in older samples. Older Th17 and Th1 cells proliferated to a lesser degree following in vitro exposure to bacterial antigens vs. their younger counterparts. Levels of spontaneous cell death were increased in older CD4 T cells; however, cellular death profiles following activation did not differ based on age. Thus, small intestinal CD4 T cells from older persons have altered phenotypic and functional profiles including reduced expression of a co-inhibitory molecule, increased spontaneous cell death, and both reduced frequencies and altered functional responses of specific Th cell subsets.

Countries face the challenges of rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases due to increasing risk factors and ageing populations, along with under-diagnosis and under-treatment. Providing noncommunicable disease medicines is only one piece of a complex picture of providing care within Universal Health Coverage that requires strengthening health-care systems, as well as financial resources, priority setting, and monitoring and evaluation systems. Financing for Universal Health Coverage needs to enable adequate resources to be allocated for medicines with a focus on equity as well as priority setting for noncommunicable diseases medicines for reimbursement in benefits packages, efficient procurement and distribution of these medicines, supported by price regulation. These processes need to be evidence-based, transparent and grounded on national values and priorities.

The risk of perceived neighborhood disorder and lack of social cohesion on depression was estimated using two-stage individual participant data metaanalysis; country-specific parameters were analyzed by meta-regression. We ran additional analyses on individuals reaching retirement. Neighborhood disorder [Odds Ratio (OR)=1.25] and lack of social cohesion (OR=1.76) were significantly associated with depression in the fully adjusted models. In retirement, the risk of depression was even higher (neighborhood disorder: OR=1.35; lack of social cohesion: OR=1.93). Heterogeneity across countries was low and significantly reduced by the addition of country-level income inequality and population density. Perceived neighborhood problems increased the overall risk of depression among adults aged 50 and over.

For this purpose, the Elderly-Nutrient rich food (E-NRF7.3) score has been developed to assess nutrient density of diets by capturing dietary reference values for older adults. To demonstrate its practical importance such score should be validated against markers of nutritional status and health. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to examine the association between the E-NRF7.3 score and markers of nutritional status and inflammation. <b>Design:</b> This study was carried out in a sample of the NU-AGE study including 242 Dutch and 210 Polish men and women, aged 65-79 years. Dietary intake was assessed by means of 7-day food records and structured questionnaires collected data on supplement use, lifestyle, and socio-economic information. Baseline measurements included anthropometrics, physical and cognitive function tests, and a fasting venipuncture. E-NRF7.3 scores were calculated to estimate nutrient density of foods and the diet. Associations between the E-NRF7.3 scores and micronutrient status of vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12, homocysteine, and c-reactive protein (CRP) were examined using linear regression analysis while adjusting for confounders. <b>Results:</b> Each one unit increase in E-NRF7.3 score was associated with a 2.2% increase in serum folate in Dutch and 1.6% increase in Polish participants in the fully adjusted models (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Each one unit increase in E-NRF7.3 was significantly associated with a 1.5% decrease in homocysteine levels in Dutch participants (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), whereas, a 0.9% increase in vitamin B12 levels was observed in Polish participants only (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Higher E-NRF7.3 scores were not associated with vitamin D or CRP levels. Adjustment for potential confounders did not substantially alter these results. <b>Discussion:</b> The E-NRF7.3 was developed to reflect dietary intake of relevant nutrients for older adults. Its association with markers of nutritional status could be confirmed for folate (both populations), vitamin B12 (Poland only), and homocysteine (the Netherlands only). There was no association with vitamin D and CRP. To further demonstrate its validity and practical implication, future studies should include a wider range of nutritional status makers, health outcomes, and inflammation markers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Kramer, Szmidt, Sicinska, Brzozowska, Santoro, Franceschi, de Groot and Berendsen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In contrast, inefficient autophagy has been linked with detrimental effects on the organism and various diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Previous research, however, showed that this paradigm is far from being black and white. For instance, it has been reported that increased levels of autophagy during development can be harmful, but become advantageous in the aging cell or organism, causing enhanced healthspan and even longevity. The antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis postulates that genes, which control various traits in an organism, can be fitness-promoting in early life, but subsequently trigger aging processes later. Autophagy is controlled by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key player of nutrient sensing and signaling and classic example of a pleiotropic gene. mTOR acts upstream of transcription factors such as FOXO, NRF, and TFEB, controlling protein synthesis, degradation, and cellular growth, thereby regulating fertility as well as aging. Here, we review recent findings about the pleiotropic role of autophagy during development and aging, examine the upstream factors, and contemplate specific mechanisms leading to disease, especially neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Schmeisser and Parker.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Loss of skeletal integrity and regeneration capacity through aging, obesity, and disease follows from a detrimental shift in bone formation and resorption dynamics. Targeting tissue-resident adult stem cells offers a potentially innovative paradigm in the development of therapeutic strategies against organ dysfunction. While the essential role of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) for development, growth, and maintenance of the skeleton has been generally established, a common consensus on the exact identity and definition of a pure <i>bona fide</i> SSC population remains elusive. The controversies stem from conflicting results between different approaches and criteria for isolation, detection, and functional evaluation; along with the interchangeable usage of the terms SSC and 'mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC)'. A great number of prospective bone-forming stem cell populations have been reported with various characteristic markers, often describing overlapping cell populations with widely unexplored heterogeneity, species specificity, and distribution at distinct skeletal sites, bone regions, and microenvironments, thereby creating confusion that may complicate future advances in the field. In this review, we examine the state-of-the-art knowledge of SSC biology and try to establish a common ground for the definition and terminology of specific bone-resident stem cells.

In South Africa, the medical specialty in PH, Public Health Medicine (PHM), has existed for over 40 years. Four years of accredited training plus success in a single national exit exam allows specialist registration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). However, there are few posts designated specifically for PHM specialists in SA's health system. In view of uncertain roles, this research was designed to determine specialists' career paths, their work, job satisfaction, and perspectives on the future of the specialty. We combined three databases to generate the study population and invited all specialists to participate in an online or hard-copy survey. We found that in 2010, PHM was a small specialty of less 200 physicians. Of the 151 contactable, eligible physicians, 55.6% completed the questionnaire. Participants represented an aging group (median age = 49) of specialists and recent graduates were increasingly women. They largely worked in academic institutions (as managers, teachers, and researchers) and in the public sector health system; were motivated by a sense of social justice and their training was formative, exposing them to work settings which they later entered; were largely highly satisfied at work, but many worked in non-specialist positions. Indeed, one fifth had not registered with the HPCSA as specialists. They were concerned about the specialty's poor visibility and identity, but did not see other PH professionals as a threat. They believed that the specialty should refine its competencies, demonstrate its value and advocate for service positions at all levels of the public sector health service. PHM has a contribution to make-reorienting services to protect communities, preventing ill health, analyzing disease burdens locally, identifying innovations in a resource-constrained health service, largely preoccupied with curative care services.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zweigenthal, Pick and London.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Our results revealed that SD-F significantly enhanced memory ability in the object recognition and object location tasks in a dose-dependent manner in aged mice relative to controls. The numbers of Nissl-positive cells in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG) regions were increased in SD-F-treated aged mice relative to controls. RNA-seq analysis of the hippocampus of aged mice identified 542 differentially expressed genes, of which 216 were up-regulated and 326 were down-regulated in SD-F-treated mice relative to controls. Of the 216 up-regulated genes, we identified four characteristic genes directly related to memory, including <i>early growth response protein 1</i> (<i>Egr1</i>), <i>growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta</i> (<i>Gadd45b</i>), <i>NGFI-A binding protein 2</i> (<i>Nab2</i>), and <i>vascular endothelial growth factor a</i> (<i>Vegfa</i>). These results suggest that the efficacy of SD-F involves upregulation of these genes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Analysis of neuropsychological test data presents challenges since a single test often requires drawing upon multiple cognitive functions to perform well. It can thus be imprecise to link performance on a given test to a specific cognitive function. Our objective was to provide insight into how cognitive functions are associated with brain amyloid-beta positivity among samples consisting of cognitively normal and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects, by using partially ordered set models (POSETs). <b>Methods:</b> We used POSET classification models of neuropsychological test data to classify samples to detailed cognitive profiles using ADNI2 and AIBL data. We considered 3 gradations of episodic memory, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, attention and perceptual motor speed, and performed group comparisons of cognitive functioning stratified by amyloid positivity (yes/no) and age (&lt;70, 70-80, 81-90 years). We also employed random forest methods stratified by age to assess the effectiveness of cognitive testing in predicting amyloid positivity, in addition to demographic variables, and <i>APOE</i>4 allele count. <b>Results:</b> In ADNI2, differences in episodic memory and attention by amyloid were found for &lt;70, and 70-80 years groups. In AIBL, episodic memory differences were found in the 70-80 years age group. In both studies, no cognitive differences were found in the 81-90 years group. The random forest analysis indicates that variable importance in classification depends on age. Cognitive testing that targets an intermediate level of episodic memory and delayed recall, in addition to <i>APOE</i>4 allele count, are the most important variables in both studies. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the ADNI2 and AIBL samples, the associations between specific cognitive abilities and brain amyloid-beta positivity depended on age, but in general episodic memory was most consistently predictive of brain amyloid-beta positivity. Random forest methods and OOB error rates establish the feasibility of predicting the presence of brain beta-amyloid using cognitive testing, <i>APOE</i>4 genotyping and demographic variables.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Carr, Jaeger, Bian, He, Maserejian, Wang, Maruff, Enayetallah, Wang, Chen, Lerner and Tatsuoka.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the meaning of facial expressions may change depending on what we have learned about the related consequences. For instance, a smile might easily become threatening when displayed by a person who is known to be dangerous. The present study examined the malleability of emotional facial valence by means of social learning. To this end, facial expressions served as cues for verbally instructed threat-of-shock or safety (e.g., 'happy faces cue shocks'). Moreover, reversal instructions tested the flexibility of threat/safety associations (e.g., 'now happy faces cue safety'). Throughout the experiment, happy, neutral, and angry facial expressions were presented and auditory startle probes elicited defensive reflex activity. Results show that self-reported ratings and physiological reactions to threat/safety cues dissociate. Regarding threat and valence ratings, happy facial expressions tended to be more resistant becoming a threat cue, and angry faces remain threatening even when instructed as safety cue. For physiological response systems, however, we observed threat-potentiated startle reflex and enhanced skin conductance responses for threat compared to safety cues regardless of whether threat was cued by happy or angry faces. Thus, the incongruity of visual and verbal threat/safety information modulates conscious perception, but not the activation of physiological response systems. These results show that verbal instructions can readily overwrite the intrinsic meaning of facial emotions, with clear benefits for social communication as learning and anticipation of threat and safety readjusted to accurately track environmental changes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Bublatzky, Riemer and Guerra.</CopyrightInformation>"}

SIRT1 is involved in a variety of biological processes, including energy metabolism, cell proliferation and survival, chromatin dynamics, and DNA repair. In the vasculature, SIRT1 is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and perivascular adipose tissues (PVAT). Endothelial SIRT1 plays a unique role in vasoprotection by regulating a large variety of proteins, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In endothelial cells, SIRT1 and eNOS regulate each other synergistically through positive feedback mechanisms for the maintenance of endothelial function. Recent studies have shown that SIRT1 plays a vital role in modulating PVAT function, arterial remodeling, and vascular aging.

The stability, and ultimate demise, of memory over the lifespan of an organism remains a critical topic in determining the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate memory representations. This has important implications for the elucidation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). One important question in the context of preserving functional plasticity over the lifespan is the determination of the neurobiological structural and functional changes that contribute to the formation of memory during the juvenile time frame that might provide protection against later memory dysfunction by promoting the establishment of redundant neural pathways. The main question being, if memory formation during the juvenile period does strengthen and preserve memory stability over the lifespan, what are the neurobiological structural or functional substrates that mediate this effect? One neural attribute whose function may be altered with early life experience and provide a mechanism to preserve memory through the lifespan is glucose transport-linked calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) buffering. Because peak increases in glucose utilization overlap with a timeframe during which spatial training can enhance later memory processing, it might be the case that learning-associated changes in glucose utilization would provide an important neural functional change to preserve memory function throughout the lifespan. The glucose transporters are proteins that are reduced in AD pathology and there is evidence that glucose reductions can impair Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. In the absence of an appropriate supply of ATP, provided via glucose transport and glycolysis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels can rise leading to neural vulnerability with ensuing pathological outcomes. In this review, we explore the hypothesis that enhancing glucose utilization with spatial training during the preadolescent period will provide a functional enhancement that regulates glucose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during aging or neurodegeneration and provide essential neural resources to preserve functional plasticity and memory function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Holahan, Tzakis and Oliveira.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Neuronal damage in these mice is associated with astrogliosis and induction of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. GFAP-luc transgenic mice express firefly luciferase under the GFAP promoter, allowing bioluminescence to be measured non-invasively as a surrogate biomarker for astrogliosis. We bred double transgenic mice possessing both P301S and GFAP-luc cassettes and compared them to control mice bearing only the GFAP-luc transgene. We used serial bioluminescent images to define the onset and the time course of astrogliosis in these mice and this was correlated with the development of clinical deficit. Mice containing both GFAP-luc and P301S transgenes showed increased luminescence indicative of astroglial activation in the brain and spinal cord. Starting at 5 months old, the onset of clinical deterioration in these mice corresponded closely to the initial rise in the luminescent signal. Post mortem analysis showed the elevated luminescence was correlated with hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the hippocampus of double transgenic mice. We used this method to determine the therapeutic effect of JM4 peptide [a small peptide immunomodulatory agent derived from human erythropoietin (EPO)] on double transgenic mice. JM4 treatment significantly decreased the intensity of luminescence, neurological deficit and hyperphosphorylated tau in mice with both the P301S and GFAP-luc transgenes. These findings indicate that bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a powerful tool for quantifying GFAP expression in living P301S mice and can be used as a noninvasive biomarker of tau-induced neurodegeneration in preclinical therapeutic trials.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Dunn-Meynell, Dowling, Marchese, Rodriguez, Blumberg, Choi, Gaindh and Lu.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Eleven AD, 17 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 13 cognitively normal (CN) subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and amyloid PET imaging using [18F]-FMM and [11C]-PIB during a follow-up period. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered MRI, and the FMM and PIB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was used in the same cortical regions. The annual rate of change in FMM and PIB SUVRs was calculated. Cortical FMM SUVR in amyloid-positive subjects increased over a follow-up of 3.1 ± 0.5 years. An individual FMM SUVR was significantly correlated with PIB SUVR at baseline and at follow-up in the same AD, MCI, and CN subjects. The annual rate of increase in FMM SUVR was significantly greater in typical amyloid-positive (0.033 ± 0.023, <i>n</i> = 7), focal positive MCI (0.076 ± 0.034, <i>n</i> = 4) and positive CN (0.039 ± 0.027, <i>n</i> = 4) while that in AD (0.020 ± 0.018, <i>n</i> = 11) was smaller.

Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [<sup>18</sup>F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [<sup>18</sup>F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [<sup>18</sup>F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [<sup>18</sup>F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Schönecker, Brendel, Palleis, Beyer, Höglinger, Schuh, Rauchmann, Sauerbeck, Rohrer, Sonnenfeld, Furukawa, Ishiki, Okamura, Bartenstein, Dieterich, Bötzel, Danek, Rominger and Levin.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Related to these outcomes is the increased prevalence of hypertension, which independently increases the development of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. While a direct mechanistic link between hypertension and poor brain health is unknown, many hypothesize that the etiology stems from poor blood pressure (BP) and cerebrovascular regulation. This dysfunction fosters hypoperfusion of the brain, causing stress to the tissue through a nutrient mismatch, subtly damaging the brain over many years. Current Western medical treatment relies on pharmacological treatment (mainly beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or a combination of the two). However, Western treatments have not been successful in mitigating brain health outcomes and are burdened with unwanted side effects and non-adherence issues. Alternatively, traditional East Asia medicine has used acupuncture as a treatment for hypertension and may offer a promising approach in response to the limitations of conventional therapy. While detailed clinical and mechanistic experimental evidence is lacking, acupuncture has been observed to reduce BP and improve endothelial function in hypertensive adults. Further, acupuncture has been shown to have specific cerebrovascular effects, increasing cerebrovascular reactivity in healthy adults, highlighting possible neuroprotective properties.

In the present study, 45 brain-enriched miRs were evaluated in serum samples from 50 normal subjects and 50 sporadic PD patients. The level of miR-204-5p was upregulated in serum samples from PD patients. An upregulated level of miR-204-5p was also observed in the serum and substantia nigra (SN) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Expression of miR-204-5p increased the level of α-synuclein (α-Syn), phosphorylated (phospho)-α-Syn, tau, or phospho-tau protein and resulted in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells. Expression of miR-204-5p caused autophagy impairment and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptotic cascade in SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells.

In recent years, its importance as a source of pharmacological active substance is growing rapidly due to its properties such as anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-apoptosis, anti-radiation, anti-tumor, and anti-aging. However, the neuroprotective effects of Orientin on stroke injury have not been comprehensively evaluated. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate the neuroprotective capacity and the potential mechanisms of Cyperus esculentus L. orientin (CLO) from Cyperus esculentus L. leaves against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury using standard orientin as control. For in vitro studies, we treated HT22 cells with CoCl<sub>2</sub> as an in vitro ischemic injury model. HT22 cells in the control group were treated with CoCl<sub>2</sub>. For in vivo studies, we used rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion, and animals that received sham surgery were used as controls. We found that CLO protected CoCl<sub>2</sub>-induced HT22 cells against ischemia/reperfusion injury by lowering lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species formation as well as decreasing protein oxidation. However, CLO did not reduce the release of lactate dehydrogenase nor increase the activity of superoxide dismutase. Results showed that CLO could decrease neurological deficit score, attenuate brain water content, and reduce cerebral infarct volume, leading to neuroprotection during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our studies indicate that CLO flavonoids can be taken as a natural antioxidant and bacteriostastic substance in food and pharmaceutical industry. The molecular mechanisms of CLO could be at least partially attributed to the antioxidant properties and subsequently inhibiting activation of casepase-3.

The government has since quadrupled its funding for health. The reform's first phase (2009-11) emphasised expanding social health insurance coverage for all and strengthening infrastructure. The second phase (2012 onwards) prioritised reforming its health-care delivery system through: (1) systemic reform of public hospitals by removing mark-up for drug sales, adjusting fee schedules, and reforming provider payment and governance structures; and (2) overhaul of its hospital-centric and treatment-based delivery system. In the past 10 years, China has made substantial progress in improving equal access to care and enhancing financial protection, especially for people of a lower socioeconomic status. However, gaps remain in quality of care, control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), efficiency in delivery, control of health expenditures, and public satisfaction. To meet the needs of China's ageing population that is facing an increased NCD burden, we recommend leveraging strategic purchasing, information technology, and local pilots to build a primary health-care (PHC)-based integrated delivery system by aligning the incentives and governance of hospitals and PHC systems, improving the quality of PHC providers, and educating the public on the value of prevention and health maintenance.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy intake was extracted to compare night, day, afternoon/evening and rotating shift work cases.<b>Results</b>: After duplicate removal, we screened 1057 abstracts and 68 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility of which 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were cross-sectional and case-control designs in shift workers. Risk of bias assessment showed a low to moderate risk of bias in the majority of studies. There was no difference in energy intake between night-shift work and non-night shift patterns including early morning, day and afternoon/evening shifts.

The nuclear expression of p21 in activated wound fibroblasts delayed the onset of the proliferation phase of wound healing in a p53-independent manner. Further, the local and transient inhibition of p21 expression by in vivo delivered p21-targeting siRNA ameliorated the delayed wound healing in aged mice. Our results suggest that the increased number of p21<sup>+</sup> wound fibroblasts enforces the age-related compromised healing, and targeting p21 creates potential clinical avenues to promote wound healing in aged population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

With data from 16 years of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we utilized the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association to calculate risk scores for a representative sample.

The ASCVD risk scores can thus be used to evaluate the general cardiac health of the population. Results showed that a quarter of the US adult population was at risk to contract ASCVD in the next 10 years, indicating the need for targeted preventative measures.

Using the World Health Organization criteria for effective screening programs, we reviewed validity, reliability, and feasibility of data-driven screening tools for identifying PEM and frailty risk among community-dwelling older adults. The SCREEN II is recommended for PEM screening and the FRAIL scale is recommended as the most promising frailty screening tool, based on test characteristics, cost, and ease of use, but more research on both tools is needed, particularly on predictive validity of favorable outcomes after nutritional/physical activity interventions. The Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) has been recommended by one expert group as a screening tool for all adults, regardless of age/care setting. However, it has not been tested in US community settings, likely yields large numbers of false positives (particularly in community settings), and its predictive validity of favorable outcomes after nutritional interventions is unknown. Community subgroups at highest priority for screening are those at increased risk due to prior illness, certain demographics and/or domiciliary characteristics, and those with BMI &lt; 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &lt; 22 if &gt; 70 years or recent unintentional weight loss &gt; 10% (who are likely already malnourished).

In particular, aging biologists have tended to emphasize functional declines during aging, rather than biological adaptation and population selection or composition processes; the reality is certainly that all these processes interact. Failure to make these distinctions could lead to interventions that improve superficial markers of aging while harming underlying health, particularly as the health priorities of older adults (autonomy, function, freedom from suffering, etc.) are often quite different from the goals of aging biologists (reducing disease, prolonging life). One approach to disentangling positive, negative, and neutral changes is to map trajectories of change across the life course of an individual (physiobiography).

Here we show in a murine model of pemphigus, a prototypic cutaneous autoantibody-mediated disorder, that blood-circulating IgG extravasates into the skin in a time- and dose-dependent manner under homeostatic conditions. This IgG extravasation is unaffected by depletion of Fcγ receptors, but is largely attenuated by specific ablation of dynamin-dependent endocytic vesicle formation in blood endothelial cells (BECs). Among dynamin-dependent endocytic vesicles, IgG co-localizes well with caveolae in cultured BECs. An Abl family tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which reduces caveolae-mediated endocytosis, impairs IgG extravasation in the skin and attenuates the murine pemphigus manifestations. Our study highlights the kinetics of IgG extravasation in vivo, which might be a clue to understand the pathological mechanism of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disorders.</AbstractText>"}

We hypothesize that i-Extract may primarily target muscarinic subtype acetylcholine receptors that regulate memory processes. The present study elucidates key target(s) of i-Extract via cellular, biochemical, and molecular techniques in a relevant amnesia mouse model and primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. Wild type Swiss albino mice were fed i-Extract, and hippocampal cells from naïve mice were treated with i-Extract, followed by muscarinic antagonist (dicyclomine) and agonist (pilocarpine) treatments. We measured dendritic formation and growth by immunocytochemistry, kallikrein 8 (KLK8) mRNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and levels of KLK8 and microtubule-associated protein 2, c isoform (MAP2c) proteins by western blotting. We performed muscarinic receptor radioligand binding. i-Extract stimulated an increase in dendrite growth markers, KLK8 and MAP2.

The effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a general pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, on in vivo energy expenditure in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a western diet (WD) has not yet been investigated. WD-fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed atherosclerotic plaques and hyperlipidemia along with obesity, which were significantly ameliorated by DCA administration. Increased oxygen consumption was associated with heat production in the DCA-treated group, with no change in food intake or physical activity compared with those of the control. These processes were correlated with the increased gene expression of Dio2 and Ucp-1, which represents brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation, in both WD-induced atherosclerosis and high-fat-induced obesity models. In addition, we found that DCA stimulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) mRNA expression, which might be important for lowering lipid levels and insulin sensitization via BAT activation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner associated with serum FGF21 levels. Interestingly, Fgf21 mRNA expression was mediated in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner within several minutes after DCA treatment independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Taken together, the results suggest that enhanced glucose oxidation by DCA protects against atherosclerosis by inducing hepatic FGF21 expression and BAT activation, resulting in augmented energy expenditure for heat generation.</AbstractText>"}

We first show that TOM1 steady-state levels are reduced in human AD hippocampi and in the brain of an AD mouse model versus respective controls. Experimentally reducing TOM1 affected microglia activity, substantially increased amyloid-beta levels, and impaired cognition, whereas enhancing its levels was therapeutic. These data show that reparation of the TOM1-signaling pathway represents a therapeutic target for brain inflammatory disorders such as AD.

Respiratory medicine","Date":"Jan 2020","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The past six decades have seen remarkable improvements in health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis, which was once a fatal disease of infants and young children. However, although life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis has increased substantially, the disease continues to limit survival and quality of life, and results in a large burden of care for people with cystic fibrosis and their families. Furthermore, epidemiological studies in the past two decades have shown that cystic fibrosis occurs and is more frequent than was previously thought in populations of non-European descent, and the disease is now recognised in many regions of the world. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission on the future of cystic fibrosis care was established at a time of great change in the clinical care of people with the disease, with a growing population of adult patients, widespread genetic testing supporting the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and the development of therapies targeting defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which are likely to affect the natural trajectory of the disease. The aim of the Commission was to bring to the attention of patients, health-care professionals, researchers, funders, service providers, and policy makers the various challenges associated with the changing landscape of cystic fibrosis care and the opportunities available for progress, providing a blueprint for the future of cystic fibrosis care. The discovery of the CFTR gene in the late 1980s triggered a surge of basic research that enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology and the genotype-phenotype relationships of this clinically variable disease. Until recently, available treatments could only control symptoms and restrict the complications of cystic fibrosis, but advances in CFTR modulator therapies to address the basic defect of cystic fibrosis have been remarkable and the field is evolving rapidly. However, CFTR modulators approved for use to date are highly expensive, which has prompted questions about the affordability of new treatments and served to emphasise the considerable gap in health outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis between high-income countries, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Advances in clinical care have been multifaceted and include earlier diagnosis through the implementation of newborn screening programmes, formalised airway clearance therapy, and reduced malnutrition through the use of effective pancreatic enzyme replacement and a high-energy, high-protein diet. Centre-based care has become the norm in high-income countries, allowing patients to benefit from the skills of expert members of multidisciplinary teams. Pharmacological interventions to address respiratory manifestations now include drugs that target airway mucus and airway surface liquid hydration, and antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotic eradication treatment in early-stage infections and protocols for maintenance therapy of chronic infections. Despite the recent breakthrough with CFTR modulators for cystic fibrosis, the development of novel mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective therapies is likely to remain important, especially for patients with more advanced stages of lung disease. As the median age of patients with cystic fibrosis increases, with a rapid increase in the population of adults living with the disease, complications of cystic fibrosis are becoming increasingly common. Steps need to be taken to ensure that enough highly qualified professionals are present in cystic fibrosis centres to meet the needs of ageing patients, and new technologies need to be adopted to support communication between patients and health-care providers. In considering the future of cystic fibrosis care, the Commission focused on five key areas, which are discussed in this report: the changing epidemiology of cystic fibrosis (section 1); future challenges of clinical care and its delivery (section 2); the building of cystic fibrosis care globally (section 3); novel therapeutics (section 4); and patient engagement (section 5). In panel 1, we summarise key messages of the Commission. The challenges faced by all stakeholders in building and developing cystic fibrosis care globally are substantial, but many opportunities exist for improved care and health outcomes for patients in countries with established cystic fibrosis care programmes, and in LMICs where integrated multidisciplinary care is not available and resources are lacking at present. A concerted effort is needed to ensure that all patients with cystic fibrosis have access to high-quality health care in the future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

As care goals shift from surviving to thriving, a new focus on quality of life has emerged. Neurocognition and the ability to participate fully in society, form meaningful relationships, and collaborate effectively with the health care system are important considerations. As adults with CHD age, research regarding their cognitive function becomes prescient. The focus is now shifting from defining neurocognitive deficits in children with CHD to preventing neurocognitive decline in adults living with CHD. In this review, we describe the possible etiologies and predictors of neurocognitive decline in adults with CHD. We performed a comprehensive literature review to identify all of the current data available on neurocognitive function in adults with CHD. We summarize the available evidence by describing common deficits in this patient population and the potential effects of these deficits on adult functioning, health care decision-making, and long-term relationships with care providers. We review potential modifiable etiologies for progressive neurocognitive decline and suggest strategies for surveillance and prevention of the potential decline. We conclude that the current information available regarding the aging brain of adults with CHD and the effect of neurocognitive decline on morbidity and mortality is woefully insufficient. This review, therefore, provides a roadmap for future research endeavours to study neurocognition in older adults with CHD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Renal senescence is induced not only by aging but also by various stimuli, including ischemia reperfusion injury. Recently, the accumulation of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive cells in the kidney has been considered a molecular feature of renal senescence, with the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> gene reportedly regulated by mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1)/WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5)-mediated histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Here, we determined whether inhibition of MLL1/WDR5 activity attenuates renal senescence, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with ischemia reperfusion injury and in cultured rat renal fibroblasts. MM-102 or OICR-9429, both MLL1/WDR5 protein-protein interaction inhibitors, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MLL1 or WDR5 suppressed the expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> in mice with ischemia reperfusion injury, accompanied by downregulation of H3K4me3 expression. MM-102 attenuated renal fibrosis and inflammation in the kidney of mice with ischemia reperfusion injury. Moreover, in vitro study showed that transforming growth factor-β1 induced the expression of MLL1, WDR5, H3K4me3, and p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation identified the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> promoter at an H3K4me3 site in renal fibroblasts.

Two hours after taking L-DOPA or placebo-drug, QPS was applied over the motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials were recorded to evaluate the motor cortical excitability changes. We found that both doses of L-DOPA enhanced LTP after QPS in older adults as one group. We classified subjects into QPS responders and QPS nonresponders. Both L-DOPA doses produced significant LTP enhancement in QPS nonresponders, whereas either of doses did not produce significant LTP enhancement in QPS responders.

The deposition of amyloid plaques leads to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, and cognitive impairment. Among the neurotransmitters, glutamate is the most abundant in the mammalian brain and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity. With respect to synaptic transmission, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is highly affected by amyloid pathology. However, the neuropathologic changes in the protein expression of mGluR5 in AD remain unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the alteration in mGluR5 expression with the progression of AD, we performed serial behavioral tests, longitudinal imaging studies, and histopathological immunoassay for both 5xFAD (n = 14) mice and age-matched wild-type mice (n = 14). The 5xFAD mice started showing severe hyperactivity and memory impairment from 7 months of age. In addition, mGluR5 positron emission tomography revealed that while the binding values in the wild-type mice were similar over time, those in 5xFAD mice fluctuated from 5 months of age. Furthermore, the 5xFAD mice presented a 35% decrease in the binding values of their cortical and subcortical areas at 9 months of age compared with those at 3 months of age. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and histopathological studies showed similar changes. In conclusion, mGluR5 availability changes with age, and mGluR5 positron emission tomography could successfully detect this synaptic change in the 5xFAD mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is, therefore, important to determine the interaction between the effects of cannabis and aging. The aim of this report is to describe the link between cannabis use and the aging brain. Our review of the literature found few and inconsistent empirical studies that directly address the impact of cannabis use on the aging brain. However, research focused on long-term cannabis use points toward cumulative effects on multimodal systems in the brain that are similarly affected during aging. Specifically, the effects of cannabis and aging converge on overlapping networks in the endocannabinoid, opioid, and dopamine systems that may affect functional decline particularly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which are critical areas for memory and executive functioning. To conclude, despite the limited current knowledge on the potential interactive effects between cannabis and aging, evidence from the literature suggests that cannabis and aging effects are concurrently present across several neurotransmitter systems. There is a great need for future research to directly test the interactions between cannabis and aging.</AbstractText>"}

However, direct introduction of the micrometer-thick graphene stack structure on the extremely inert fiber surface with little negative effect has barely been reported so far and is still a great challenge. In the present work, a facile and cost-efficient dimensionally confined hydrothermal reduction, static adsorption, and thermal-assisted shrinkage sequential treatment strategy was developed to fabricate one-dimensional CHFs. The large-scale reduced graphene oxide-metal organic framework (RGO-UIO-66) hybrid layer and poly(<i>p</i>-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fiber serve as the sheath part and core part, respectively, and the final product is denoted as PGU-CHFs. The experimental results confirmed that the prepared monofilament composite with thermoplastic polyurethane (PGU-CHF-TPU) exhibited an excellent and stable intrinsically self-healing efficiency (about 85%) over 5 cycles and an extraordinary uvioresistant performance (increased by 128%) compared to those of pristine PBO fibers after 288 h UV aging irradiation. Moreover, the anti-ultraviolet (UV) properties of PGU-CHFs at 96 h are basically at the optimum level among most of the reported literatures at present after comparison. The highly near-infrared photothermal conversion ability and stability of micrometer-thick RGO stack structure and the synergism of RGO-UIO-66 hybrid sheath layer including UV adsorption, shielding attenuation, and reflection are responsible for the satisfactorily interfacial self-healing efficiency and UV-resistance properties of PGU-CHFs, respectively. Considering the diversities and versatilities of RGO and MOFs, the proposed fabrication strategy will promisingly endow PBO fibers with great application potential in the other fields such as fiber-based sensors and smart fibers.</AbstractText>"}

Cellular morphology also displays parallel increases in spread area and cytoskeletal assembly, with a threefold increase in vimentin filaments alongside a decrease in its remodelling rate. Treatments with withaferin A or acrylamide show that cell motility can be modulated by regulating vimentin assembly. Crucially, decreasing vimentin amount in cells from older individuals to levels displayed by the neonatal donor rescues their motility. Our results suggest that increased vimentin assembly may underlay the aberrant biophysical properties progressively observed at the cellular level in the course of human ageing and propose vimentin as a potential therapeutic target for ageing-related diseases.</AbstractText>"}

It was found that the tested extracts in most cases did not adversely affect the effects of the composting process compared to pure polylactide, often resulting in intensification of biodegradation processes. As a result of the composting process, changes in the macro- and microscopic appearance of the samples and a decrease in molecular weight, phase transition temperatures, thermal resistance, and thermal strength were observed on a scale close to or greater than the reference anti-aging compound.</AbstractText>"}

We previously observed that dose levels of SFN are crucial in determining life or death of lens epithelial cells (LECs). Herein, we demonstrated that higher doses of SFN (&gt;6 μM) activated death signaling by overstimulation of Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant response element)-mediated Kruppel-like factor (Klf9) repression of <i>Prdx6</i> expression, which increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) load and cell death. Mechanistically, Klf9 bound to its repressive Klf9 binding elements (RKBE; 5-C<sup>A/G</sup>CCC-3) in the <i>Prdx6</i> promoter, and repressed Prdx6 transcription. Under the condition of higher dose of SFN, excessive Nrf2 abundance caused death signaling by enforcing Klf9 activation through ARE (5-RTGAYnnnGC-3) in Klf9 promoter that suppress antioxidant genes such as <i>Prdx6</i> via a Klf9-dependent fashion. Klf9-depletion showed that Klf9 independently caused ROS reduction and subsequent cell survival, demonstrating that Klf9 upregulation caused cell death. Our work revealed the molecular mechanism of dose-dependent altered activity of SFN in LECs, and demonstrated that SFN activity was linked to levels of Nrf2/Klf9/Prdx6 axis. We proposed that in the development of therapeutic interventions for aging/oxidative disorders, combinations of Klf9-ShRNA and Nrf2 inducers may prove to be a promising strategy.</AbstractText>"}

Thus, we aimed to define psychological frailty, clarify its prevalence, and investigate the relationship between psychological frailty and lifestyle activity or disability incidence in older adults in Japan. The participants in our study were 4126 older adults (average age 71.7 years) enrolled in the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology-i87uStudy of Geriatric Syndromes (NCGG-SGS). We characterized physical frailty of the following as ≥ 3: slow walking speed, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and weight loss. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale 15 items version (GDS-15) to screen for depressive mood, indicated by 5 points or more on the scale. The co-presence of physical frailty and depressive mood was defined as psychological frailty. The incidence of disability was determined using data from the Japanese long-term care insurance system over 49 months. We found that the prevalence of physical frailty, depressive mood, and psychological frailty were 6.9%, 20.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. Logistic regression indicated that the odds ratios for loss of lifestyle activities were significantly higher in participants with psychological frailty for going outdoors using the bus or train, driving a car, using maps to go to unfamiliar places, reading books or newspapers, cognitive stimulation, culture lessons, giving advice, attending community meetings, engaging in hobbies or sports, house cleaning, fieldwork or gardening, and taking care of grandchildren or pets. During the follow-up period, 385 participants (9.3%) developed a disability. The incidence of disability was associated with both physical and psychological frailty in the fully adjusted model. However, no significant association between disability and depressive mood was found. We conclude that individuals with psychological frailty had the highest risk of disability. Future policies should implement disability prevention strategies among older adults with psychological frailty.</AbstractText>"}

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty acid (FFA)-palmitic and oleic acid-and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic acid, pachymic acid, and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic acid, pachymic acid, and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</AbstractText>"}

T2DM is associated with cognitive impairments and metabolic factors, which increase the cellular vulnerability to develop an increased risk of age-related LOAD. This review addresses possible mechanisms due to obesity, aging, multiple intersections between T2DM and LOAD and mechanisms for the continuum of progression. Multiple ultrastructural images in female diabetic <i>db/db</i> models are utilized to demonstrate marked cellular remodeling changes of mural and glia cells and provide for the discussion of functional changes in T2DM. Throughout this review multiple endeavors to demonstrate how T2DM increases the vulnerability of the brain's neurovascular unit (NVU), neuroglia and neurons are presented. Five major intersecting links are considered: i.

Multivariable models were adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health characteristics. All-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer-specific mortality rates were estimated at 6.5%, 1.1%, and 1.9%, respectively. The median DASH total score was 3.0 (range: 1-8) (with 78.3% scoring &lt; 4.5), whereas the median allostatic load score was 3 (range: 0-9). The DASH diet, fiber, and magnesium were negatively correlated with allostatic load, whereas allostatic load predicted higher all-cause mortality, irrespective of the DASH diet. Whereas protein was protective, potassium increased all-cause mortality risk, irrespective of allostatic load. Potassium was protective against cardiovascular disease-specific mortality but was a risk factor for cancer-specific mortality. Although no moderating effects were observed, mediation by the allostatic load on cardiovascular disease-specific mortality was observed for DASH total score and selected component scores. Direct (but not indirect) effects of DASH through the allostatic load were observed for all-cause mortality, and no direct or indirect effects were observed for cancer-specific mortality. From a public health standpoint, the allostatic load may be a surrogate for the preventive effects of the DASH diet and its components on cardiovascular disease-specific mortality risk.</AbstractText>"}

Among them, <i>miR-34a</i> has been implicated in the regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs); however, its role in UC has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, bioinformatics and experimental analysis confirmed that <i>miR-34a</i> targets <i>CD44</i> (a CSC surface marker) and <i>c-Myc</i> (a well-known cell cycle regulator) in UC. We found that, surprisingly, most UC cell lines and patient samples did express <i>miR-34a</i>, although epigenetic silencing by promoter hypermethylation of <i>miR-34a</i> expression was observed only in UMUC3 cells, and a subset of patient samples. Importantly, overexpression of <i>c-Myc</i>, a frequently amplified oncogene in UC, was shown to upregulate <i>CD44</i> expression through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism, such that overexpression of the <i>c-Myc</i> 3'UTR upregulated <i>CD44</i>, and vice versa. Importantly, we observed a positive correlation between the expression of <i>c-Myc</i> and <i>CD44</i> in clinical samples obtained from UC patients. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative p53 mutant downregulated <i>miR-34a</i>, but upregulated <i>c-Myc</i> and <i>CD44</i>, in UC cell lines. Functionally, the ectopic expression of <i>miR-34a</i> was shown to significantly suppress <i>CD44</i> expression, and subsequently, suppression of cell growth and invasion capability, while also reducing chemoresistance. In conclusion, it appears that aberrant promoter methylation, and <i>c-Myc</i>-mediated ceRNA mechanisms, may attenuate the function of <i>miR-34a</i>, in UC. The tumor suppressive role of <i>miR-34a</i> in controlling CSC phenotypes in UC deserves further investigation.</AbstractText>"}

The epigenetic analysis suggested a less accessible and more condensed chromatin in old <i>Nfu</i> skeletal muscle.

The defects are due to rapid loss of embryonic neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Premature neurogenesis and abnormal neuronal migration in the mutant brain alter NSPC homeostasis. Mutant cerebral cortices also display augmented DNA damage responses, apoptosis, and histone hyperacetylation. Moreover, mutant NSPCs are impaired in forming neurospheres in vitro, and treatment with the HDAC3-specific inhibitor RGFP966 abolishes neurosphere formation. Transcriptomic analyses of neonatal cerebral cortices and cultured neurospheres support that HDAC3 regulates transcriptional programs through interaction with different transcription factors, including NFIB. These findings establish HDAC3 as a major deacetylase critical for perinatal development of the mouse cerebrum and NSPCs, thereby suggesting a direct link of this enzymatic epigenetic regulator to human cerebral and intellectual development.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Oxylipins are increasingly being measured in plasma collected in clinical studies to investigate biological mechanisms and as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for nutrient-based and drug-based interventions. Whole blood is generally stored either on ice or at room temperature prior to processing. However, the potential impacts of delays in processing, and of temperature prior to processing, on oxylipin concentrations are incompletely understood.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='OBJECTIVE' NlmCategory='OBJECTIVE'>To evaluate the effects of delayed processing of blood samples in a timeframe that is typical of a clinical laboratory setting, using typical storage temperatures, on concentrations of representative unesterified oxylipins measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='DESIGN' NlmCategory='METHODS'>Whole blood (drawn on three separate occasions from a single person) was collected into 5 mL purple-top potassium-EDTA tubes and stored for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 120 min at room temperature or on wet ice, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min with plasma collection. Each sample was run in duplicate, therefore there were six tubes and up to six data points at each time point for each oxylipin at each condition (ice/room temperature).

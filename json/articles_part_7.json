In study 1, optimal and inferior-quality images, by intentionally poor echocardiographic technique, were acquired. In study 2, sub-optimal quality images were acquired by impairing ultrasound propagation using neoprene rubber sheets (thickness 2, 3, and 4 mm) mimicking mildly, moderately, and severely impaired images, respectively. Measures (normalized to cardiac cycle duration) were volume- and strain-based SDIs defined as the standard deviation of time to minimum segmental values, and volume- and strain-derived dispersion indices. For both studies test-retest reproducibility was assessed. <b>Results:</b> Test-retest reproducibility was better for most indices when restricting the analysis to good quality images; nevertheless, only volume-, circumferential strain-, and principal tangential strain-derived LV dyssynchrony indices achieved fair to good reliability. There was no evidence of systematic bias due to sub-optimal quality image. Volume-, circumferential strain-, and principal tangential strain-derived SDIs correlated closely.

MRI sequences were taken from the dominant leg of 21 older female adults. The boundaries of all three TS muscles (SOL, soleus; GM, gastrocnemius medialis; GL, gastrocnemius lateralis) were manually outlined in transverse image sequences, and muscle volume for each muscle was calculated as the integral of the obtained cross-sectional areas of the contours along the whole length of the muscle (measured volume) and, in addition, by using the average muscle-specific shape factors of each muscle obtained from the ratio of the measured volume and the product of ACSA<sub>max</sub> and the muscle length (estimated volume).

CRF-producing cells in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) and oval division of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNSTov) are also involved in stress adaptation and mood control. Immediate early gene products, subunits of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP1) are commonly used as acute (FOS) and/or chronic (FOSB/deltaFOSB) markers for the neuronal activity in stress research. It is well known that the course of aging affects stress adaptation, but little is known about the aging-related stress sensitivity of CRF neurons. To the best of our knowledge, the stress-induced neuronal activity of CRF neurons in the course of aging in acute and chronic stress models was not studied systematically yet. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the acute restraint stress (ARS) and chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) evoked neuronal activity in CRF cells of the PVN, CeA, and BNSTov using triple-label immunofluorescence throughout the whole lifespan in the rat. We hypothesized that the FOS and FOSB content of CRF cells upon ARS or CVMS decreases with age. Our results showed that the FOS and FOSB response to ARS declined with age in the PVN-CRF cells. BNSTov and CeA CRF cells did not show remarkable stress-induced elevation of these markers neither in ARS, nor in CVMS. Exposure to CVMS resulted in an age-independent significant increase of FOSB/delta FOSB immunosignal in PVN-CRF neurons. Unexpectedly, we detected a remarkable stress-independent FOSB/deltaFOSB signal in CeA- and BNSTov-CRF cells that declined with the course of aging. In summary, PVN-CRF cells show decreasing acute stress sensitivity (i.e., FOS and FOSB immunoreactivity) with the course of aging, while their (FOSB/deltaFOSB) responsivity to chronic challenge is maintained till senescence. Stress exposure does not affect the occurrence of the examined <i>Fos</i> gene products in CeA- and BNSTov-CRF cells remarkably suggesting that their contribution to stress adaptation response does not require AP1-controlled transcriptional changes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Kovács, Berta, Csernus, Ujvári, Füredi and Gaszner.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The amyloid β (Aβ)-peptide, its amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the intermediate APP-c-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) are all important players in AD pathogenesis. In order to elucidate which APP CTF that are the most common in brain tissue of different species and developmental stages, and whether there are any differences in these fragments between AD and control brain, we investigated the occurrence of these fragments using different APP c-terminal antibodies. We noticed that whereas the conventional APP-CTFα and CTFβ fragments were most prominent in rat and mouse brain tissue, the major western blotting band detected in human, macaque and guinea pig was of approximately 20 kDa in size, possibly corresponding to the newly discovered APP-CTFη. However, this band was also intensely stained with a total protein stain, as well as by several other antibodies. The staining intensity of the 20 kDa band by the APP antibodies varied considerably between samples and correlated with the staining intensity of this band by the total protein stain. This could potentially be due to non-specific binding of the antibodies to another protein of this size. In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry confirmed that small amounts of APP were present in this band, but many other proteins were identified as well. The major hit of the mass spectrometry analysis was myelin basic protein (MBP) and a myelin removal protocol removed proportionally more of the 20 kDa APP band than the full-length APP and APP-CTFα/β bands. However, the signal could not be immunodepleted with an MBP antibody. In summary, we report on a potentially non-specific western blotting band of approximately 20 kDa and call for precaution when analyzing proteins of this size in human brain tissue.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Haytural, Lundgren, Köse, Jordà-Siquier, Kalcheva, Seed Ahmed, Winblad, Sundström, Barthet, Tjernberg and Frykman.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is diagnosed based on an individual's bone mineral density (BMD) or a fracture without trauma. BMD is usually measured by the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) method. Here we investigated factors for the earliest possible prediction of decreased BMD by examining the relationships between patients' BMD values and changes in the patients' physical and laboratory values. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 149 patients who visited our department in 2014-2015 for a variety of reasons and underwent an area BMD examination by DXA. We analyzed the relationships between decreasing BMD and the patients' gender, age, body mass index (BMI), medical background, hemoglobin, electrolytes, and thyroid function. Thirty-nine of the patients were diagnosed with osteoporosis based on their T-scores. An adjusted analysis showed that female gender, aging, and increased serum calcium level were significantly related to decreasing femoral BMD, whereas high BMI was associated with an increase in femoral BMD. Collectively the results indicate that for the early detection of low BMD, it is important for general-practice physicians to consider conducting a BMD checkup when treating female and elderly patients with a low BMI and/or elevated serum calcium level.</AbstractText>"}

However, it remains unclear how this process is regulated at a molecular level. Here we show that δ-secretase (asparagine endopeptidase, AEP) cleaves both α-Syn at N103 and Tau at N368, and mediates their fibrillization and retrograde propagation from the gut to the brain, triggering nigra dopaminergic neuronal loss associated with Lewy bodies and motor dysfunction. α-Syn N103 and Tau N368 robustly interact with each other and are highly elevated in PD patients' gut and brain. Chronic oral administration of the neurotoxin rotenone induces AEP activation and α-Syn N103/Tau N368 complex formation in the gut, eliciting constipation and dopaminergic neuronal death in an AEP-dependent manner. Preformed fibrils (PFFs) of α-Syn N103/Tau N368 are more neurotoxic and compact, and aggregate more quickly along the vagus nerve than their FL/FL counterparts or the individual fragments' fibrils. Colonic injection of PFFs induces PD pathologies, motor dysfunctions, and cognitive impairments. Thus, δ-secretase plays a crucial role in initiating PD pathology progression from the ENS to the CNS.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, it is still imperative to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying GC aggressive progression. The prognostic value and biological functions of low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing protein 2 (LDLRAD2) in GC have never been studied yet. We found that LDLRAD2 expression was significantly upregulated in GC and closely correlated with poor prognosis in GC patients. Functionally, LDLRAD2 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion, and metastasis of GC cells. Mechanistically, LDLRAD2 interacted with and inhibited Axin1 from binding to cytoplasmic β-catenin, which facilitated the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thereby activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Inhibition of β-catenin activity markedly abolished LDLRAD2-induced migration, invasion and metastasis. Together, these results suggested that LDLRAD2 contributed to invasion and metastasis of GC through activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

As self-renewal and differentiation are likely to be controlled by different gene expression programs, unraveling the underlying gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding the molecular logic of this system. In this study, we have characterized by next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) the transcriptome of germline stem cell (GSC)-like cells isolated from <i>bag of marbles</i> (<i>bam</i>) mutant <i>Drosophila</i> ovaries and compared it to the transcriptome of germ line cells isolated from wild-type ovaries. We have complemented this dataset by utilizing an RNA-immunoprecipitation strategy to identify transcripts bound to the master differentiation factor Bam. Protein complex enrichment analysis on these combined datasets allows us to delineate known and novel networks essential for GSC maintenance and differentiation. Further comparative transcriptomics illustrates similarities between GSCs and primordial germ cells and provides a molecular footprint of the stem cell state.

We aimed to examine patient, clinical, and system-level differences in the prescription of antihypertensive medications at hospital discharge after stroke. Methods- Adults with acute ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage alive at discharge were included (years 2009-2013) from 39 hospitals participating in the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry. Patient comorbidities were identified using the <i>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Edition, Australian Modification</i>) codes from the hospital admissions and emergency presentation data. The outcome variable and other system factors were derived from the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry dataset. Multivariable, multilevel logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with the prescription of antihypertensive medications at hospital discharge. Results- Of the 10 315 patients included, 79.0% (intracerebral hemorrhage, 74.1%; acute ischemic stroke, 79.8%) were prescribed antihypertensive medications at discharge. Prescription varied between hospital sites, with 6 sites &gt;2 SDs below the national average for provision of antihypertensives at discharge. Prescription was also independently associated with patient and clinical factors including history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, management in an acute stroke unit, and discharge to rehabilitation. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, females (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94), those who had greater stroke severity (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI 0.72-0.92), or dementia (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.81) were less likely to be prescribed. Conclusions- Prescription of antihypertensive medications poststroke varies between hospitals and according to patient factors including age, sex, stroke severity, and comorbidity profile. Implementation of targeted quality improvement initiatives at local hospitals may help to reduce the variation in prescription observed.</AbstractText>"}

Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a NET with poorly differentiated histological features, high proliferative properties and associated poor prognoses. As these carcinomas are so rare and, thus, affect only a small number of patients allowing for few cell lines to be derived from patient biopsies, the histological, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics associated with colorectal NEC and NEC in other organs have yet to be clearly defined. Herein, we describe the establishment of a novel NEC cell line (SS-2) derived from a tumor resection of the ascending colon from a 59-year-old Japanese woman. The histological, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features of chromogranin A (CgA) as well as confirmation of synaptophysin positivity in this tumor were typical of those commonly observed in surgically resected colorectal NEC. Further, the Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumor was &gt;20% and, thus, the tumor was diagnosed as an NEC of the ascending colon. The SS-2 cell line maintained characteristic features to those of the resected tumor, which were further retained following implantation into subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Additionally, when SS-2 cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment plates, they formed spheres that expressed higher levels of the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker CD133 compared to SS-2 cells cultured under adherent conditions. SS-2 cells may, therefore, contribute to the current knowledge on midgut NEC biological function while providing a novel platform for examining the effects of colorectal NEC drugs, including CSC.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Somatic mutations in CMML are heterogeneous and only partially explain the variability in clinical outcomes. Recent data suggest that cardiovascular morbidity is increased in CMML and contributes to reduced survival. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), the presence of mutated blood cells in hematologically normal individuals, is a precursor of age-related myeloid neoplasms and associated with increased cardiovascular risk. To isolate CMML-specific alterations from those related to aging, we performed RNA sequencing and DNA methylation profiling on purified monocytes from CMML patients and from age-matched (old) and young healthy controls. We found that the transcriptional signature of CMML monocytes is highly proinflammatory, with upregulation of multiple inflammatory pathways, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6 and -17 signaling, whereas age per se does not significantly contribute to this pattern. We observed no consistent correlations between aberrant gene expression and CpG island methylation, suggesting that proinflammatory signaling in CMML monocytes is governed by multiple and complex regulatory mechanisms. We propose that proinflammatory monocytes contribute to cardiovascular morbidity in CMML patients and promote progression by selection of mutated cell clones. Our data raise questions of whether asymptomatic patients with CMML benefit from monocyte-depleting or anti-inflammatory therapies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Drosophila is a common insect model, used to study barrier disruption related to aging, traumatic injury, or environmental stress. Net leak of a non-toxic dye (Brilliant blue FCF) from the gut lumen to the hemolymph is often used to identify barrier failure under these conditions, but Drosophila are capable of actively transporting structurally-similar compounds. Here, we examined whether cold stress (like other stresses) causes Brilliant blue FCF (BB-FCF) to appear in the hemolymph of flies fed the dye, and if so whether Drosophila are capable of clearing this dye from their body following chilling. Using in situ midgut leak and transport assays as well as Ramsay assays of Malpighian tubule transport, we tested whether these ionoregulatory epithelia can actively transport BB-FCF. In doing so, we found that the Drosophila midgut and Malpighian tubules can mobilize BB-FCF via an active transcellular pathway, suggesting that elevated concentrations of the dye in the hemolymph may occur from increased paracellular permeability, reduced transcellular clearance, or both.

Most of the recent literature regards the relationship between plasma oxidative stress and AD, showing that markers of lipid peroxidation are significantly higher in AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients with respect to control subjects. The increased generation of reactive oxygen species that occurs in AD may be also responsible for oxidative injury to erythrocyte membranes. Since erythrocyte membrane serves as a variable barrier to oxygen transport, changes in its stability can induce cellular hypoxia and the consequence brain tissue oxygenation. In this study, plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and erythrocyte membrane fluidity have been evaluated in control, MCI and AD patients. Moreover erythrocyte membrane acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity has been measured in control and AD patients. Plasma ORAC significantly decreased in MCI and AD subjects with respect to the controls, while a decrease in erythrocyte membrane fluidity has been observed only in MCI patients. No significant differences were detected in erythrocyte AchE activity between control subjects and AD patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examined how aging affects two key aspects of orienting: the benefits of orienting to valid spatial cues vs. the costs of re-orienting following invalid cues, and the impact on orienting of prior cue validity, in the context of different degrees of cue predictivity and types of cue manifestation. We analyzed accuracy and response time data from the performance of 103 older adults and 135 younger adults in three versions of the Attention Networks Test. Participants engaged in target discrimination following either locational cues that were generally non-predictive, locational cues that were generally predictive, or symbolic cues that were generally predictive. We found that healthy older adults did not exhibit greater re-orienting response time costs than younger adults across all cueing types, nor did they differ in the orienting benefits provided by predictive locational cues. However, older adults derived greater benefit from valid cues in a generally non-predictive cueing context, and lesser benefit from valid cues in a symbolic predictive cueing context. Additionally, aging had no impact on the effects of prior trial validity on subsequent trial validity benefits. A comprehensive appreciation of the effects of aging on attention may be informed by these distinctions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The state of the field, however, is less clear regarding effects from chronic OT administration, which more closely resembles long-term treatment. To address this gap, this review synthesizes existing findings on the use of chronic OT administration in animal and human work. In addition to detailing the effects of chronic OT administration across different functional domains, this review highlights factors that have contributed to mixed findings. Based on this review, a basic framework of interrelated regulatory functions sensitive to chronic OT administration is offered. The paper also identifies future research directions across different contexts, populations, and outcomes, specifically calling for more systematic and standardized research on chronic OT administration in humans to supplement and expand what is currently known from preclinical work.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The two pivotal mechanisms of aging-related endothelial dysfunction are oxidative stress and inflammation, even in the absence of clinical disease. A comprehensive understanding of the aging process is emerging as a primary concern in literature, as vascular aging has recently become a target for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Change of life-style, diet, antioxidant regimens, anti-inflammatory treatments, senolytic drugs counteract the pro-aging pathways or target senescent cells modulating their detrimental effects. Such therapies aim to reduce the ineluctable burden of age and contrast aging-associated cardiovascular dysfunction.

Beyond the hippocampal memory system, human studies also indicate that aerobic exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with individual differences in large-scale brain networks responsible for broad cognitive domains. Examining network activity in large-scale resting-state brain networks may provide a link connecting the observed relationships between aerobic exercise, hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive enhancement within broad cognitive domains. Previously, CRF has been associated with increased functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), specifically in older adults. However, how CRF relates to the magnitude and directionality of connectivity, or effective connectivity, between the HC and other DMN nodes remains unknown. We used resting-state fMRI and conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to test the hypothesis that CRF positively predicts effective connectivity between the HC and other DMN nodes in healthy young adults. Twenty-six participants (ages 18-35 years) underwent a treadmill test to determine CRF by estimating its primary determinant, maximal oxygen uptake (V<sup>.</sup> O<sub>2max</sub> ), and a 10-min resting-state fMRI scan to examine DMN effective connectivity. We identified the DMN using group independent component analysis and examined effective connectivity between nodes using CGCA. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that CRF significantly predicts causal influence from the HC to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex and to the HC from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The observed relationship between CRF and hippocampal effective connectivity provides a link between the rodent literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal plasticity, and the human literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and CRF and the enhancement of broad cognitive domains including, but not limited to, memory.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recent advances in wearable technology offer opportunities to more easily integrate monitoring of HRV into regular clinical geriatric health assessments.

Conventional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis has facilitated our understanding of BMD reduction in specific regions of interest (ROIs) within the femur, but cannot resolve spatial BMD patterns nor reflect age-related changes in bone microarchitecture due to its inherent averaging of pixel BMD values into large ROIs. To address these limitations and develop a comprehensive model of involutional bone loss, this paper presents a fully automatic pipeline to build a spatio-temporal atlas of ageing bone in the proximal femur. A new technique, termed DXA region free analysis (DXA RFA), is proposed to eliminate morphological variation between DXA scans by warping each image into a reference template. To construct the atlas, we use unprocessed DXA data from Caucasian women aged 20-97 years participating in three cohort studies in Western Europe (n&gt;13,000). A novel calibration procedure, termed quantile matching regression, is proposed to integrate data from different DXA manufacturers. Pixel-wise BMD evolution with ageing was modelled using smooth quantile curves. This technique enables characterisation of spatially-complex BMD change patterns with ageing, visualised using heat-maps. Furthermore, quantile curves plotted at different pixel coordinates showed consistently different rates of bone loss at different regions within the femoral neck. Given the close relationship between spatio-temporal bone loss and osteoporotic fracture, improved understanding of the bone ageing process could lead to enhanced prognostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for the disease.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of aging on critical antioxidant enzymes and two major redox-regulatory systems glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) system in hearts from adult (6-month-old), old (15-month-old), and senescent (26-month-old) rats. Aging was associated with a non-uniform array of changes, including decline in contents of reduced GSH and total mercaptans in the senescent heart. The activities of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD2), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) exhibited an age-related decline, whereas catalase was unchanged and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) displayed only slight decrease in old heart and was unchanged in the senescent heart. GR, Trx, and peroxiredoxin levels were significantly reduced in old and/or senescent hearts, indicating a diminished expression of these proteins. In contrast, SOD2 level was unchanged in the old heart and was slightly elevated in the senescent heart. Decline in GPx activity was accompanied by a loss of GPx level only in old rats, the level in senescent heart was unchanged. These results indicate age-related posttranslational protein modification of SOD2 and GPx. In summary, our data suggest that changes are more pronounced in senescent than in old rat hearts and support the view that aging is associated with disturbed redox balance that could alter cellular signaling and regulation.</AbstractText>"}

A life span approach to emotion recognition is lacking in the auditory domain, and it remains unclear how the speaker's and listener's ages interact in the context of decoding vocal emotions. Here, we examined age-related differences in vocal emotion recognition from childhood until older adulthood and tested for a potential own-age bias in performance. A total of 164 participants (36 children [7-11 years], 53 adolescents [12-17 years], 48 young adults [20-30 years], 27 older adults [58-82 years]) completed a forced-choice emotion categorization task with nonverbal vocalizations expressing pleasure, relief, achievement, happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality. These vocalizations were produced by 16 speakers, 4 from each age group (children [8-11 years], adolescents [14-16 years], young adults [19-23 years], older adults [60-75 years]). Accuracy in vocal emotion recognition improved from childhood to early adulthood and declined in older adults. Moreover, patterns of improvement and decline differed by emotion category: faster development for pleasure, relief, sadness, and surprise and delayed decline for fear and surprise. Vocal emotions produced by older adults were more difficult to recognize when compared to all other age groups. No evidence for an own-age bias was found, except in children. These findings support effects of both speaker and listener ages on how vocal emotions are decoded and inform current models of vocal emotion perception.

However, we often overextend these predictions to also make inferences about other people's underlying tendencies and dispositions. People with happy expressions are perceived to have stable positive traits whereas people with sad expressions are perceived to have stable negative traits. In these studies, we tested whether this extends to inferences about younger and older adults' abilities to complete fundamental activities of independent living, such as independently getting dressed, preparing food, and remembering directions. Our results showed that both younger and older adult targets were perceived to have greater everyday competence in completing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and memory tasks when they displayed happy or neutral expressions rather than sad expressions. This pattern did not vary based upon either the target's gender or the participant's age. However, for the ADL and IADL ratings, the overgeneralization of emotions to ratings of everyday competence was greater for the older adult targets than for the younger adult targets. Drawing from the ecological approach to social perception, these results suggests that spontaneous trait inferences are most likely to occur when the age-trait association is strong. Given that perceptions of competence are also associated with behavioral ramifications, such as being subjected to patronizing behavior, having lower employment opportunities, and being seen as low in social status, our results also suggest that older adults whose facial expressions appear sad may be especially prone to these adverse outcomes.

In the current experiments, we sought to explore whether error corrections are maintained across a delay and identify mechanisms that may support this process. In Experiment 1, younger and older adults answered general knowledge questions, rated confidence in their responses, were shown feedback, and rated their prior knowledge of the question and answer. Half of the participants took a final test after a 6-min delay and half returned 1 week later. Across a 1-week delay, older adults maintained a greater proportion of corrected responses than did younger adults. In Experiment 2, we examined whether participants use their memory for errors on the initial test to mediate retrieval of the correct answer on the final test (i.e., the mediator hypothesis). Participants were more likely to answer questions correctly on a final test when they recalled their initial error, but memory for the initial error was a stronger predictor of final test accuracy for younger adults than for older adults. Additionally, older adults, in comparison with younger adults, corrected a higher proportion of errors when the initial error was forgotten. Overall, inaccurate knowledge did not interfere with older adults' ability to maintain revisions in memory. In addition, we found support for the mediator hypothesis; however, other mechanisms also contribute to older adults' error correction.

The current work, however, suggests that there may also be a motivational reason. Here, we explored the possibility that for OA with relatively lower executive ability, anti-outgroup bias may serve an ironic purpose of maximizing a fundamental social goal: maintaining ingroup positivity. OA are more motivated than young adults (YA) to maximize positivity in everyday life. This process, however, can be cognitively effortful. We tested the novel predictions that (a) OA' executive ability positively predicts their evaluations of ingroup members and (b) OA might preserve positive ingroup perceptions through anti-outgroup bias if they have lower executive ability. The present work tested these predictions using a timely example of an outgroup: Muslims. Study 1 verified that non-Muslim YA and OA identified with non-Muslims (vs. Muslims) as an ingroup. Study 2 then had 3 key findings. First, we replicated work showing a negative relationship between OA' executive ability and their anti-outgroup bias by showing a negative relationship with their anti-Muslim bias. Second, OA' higher executive ability related to their having more positive perceptions of ingroup non-Muslims. Finally, OA with lower executive ability had higher ingroup positivity by having higher anti-Muslim bias. These findings suggest that when OA lack the executive ability to directly maintain a motivational goal of being positive about themselves and their ingroups, they maintain positivity at the expense of others.

Within this context, the concept of work ability, or an employee's ability to continue working in their job, has been introduced as an explanatory mechanism for understanding employee disability, wellbeing, attitudes, and behavior. However, the work ability concept has evolved across disparate literatures with multiple, content-diverse measures and often with little consideration of theory or examination of its nomological network. Using the job demands-resources model as a framework, we present a meta-analytic summary (<i>k</i> = 247; <i>N</i> = 312,987) of work ability's correlates and potential moderators of these relationships. Taken together, we found consistent negative relationships between job demands and work ability, and consistent positive relationships between job and personal resources and work ability. Work ability was also associated with important job outcomes including job attitudes and behaviors such as absenteeism and retirement. Measures of work ability that include both perceived and objective components generally showed stronger relationships than did exclusively perceptual measures, and occupation type was a significant moderator of certain relations between work ability and its correlates. We supplemented this meta-analysis with a primary data collection to examine differences between perceived work ability and the conceptually similar variables of self-efficacy and perceived fit, demonstrating that perceived work ability can explain incremental variance in job- and health-related variables. Our discussion focuses on the value of the work ability construct for both research and practice and future directions for work ability research.

Oxidative modifications of proteins have been shown to be implicated in normal physiological processes of cells as well as in pathomechanisms leading to the development of cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare hereditary metabolic diseases, like classic galactosemia. Reactive oxygen species generate a variety of reversible and irreversible modifications in amino acid residue side chains and within the protein backbone. These oxidative post-translational modifications (Ox-PTMs) can participate in the activation of signal transduction pathways and mediate the toxicity of harmful oxidants. Thus the application of advanced redox proteomics technologies is important for gaining insights into molecular mechanisms of diseases. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics is one of the most powerful methods that can be used to give detailed qualitative and quantitative information on protein modifications and allows us to characterize redox proteomes associated with diseases. This Review illustrates the role and biological consequences of Ox-PTMs under basal and oxidative stress conditions by focusing on protein carbonylation and S-glutathionylation, two abundant modifications with an impact on cellular pathways that have been intensively studied during the past decade.</AbstractText>"}

Similarly, reduced myotube width was observed in MKO primary myoblast cultures. Biomechanical studies showed reduced isometric force and power output in MKO mice as a result of the reduced CSA, whereas the force developed by each myosin molecular motor was unaffected. While the performance by treadmill running was similar in MKO and wild-type mice, MKO mice showed progressively decreased exercise capability, Z-line damage, and signs of muscle regeneration following consecutive days of downhill running. Additionally, MKO muscle exhibited progressive Z-line widening starting from 8 months of age. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed down-regulation of serum response factor (SRF)-target genes in muscles from postnatal MKO mice, important for muscle growth and differentiation. The SRF pathway is regulated by actin dynamics as binding of globular actin to the SRF-cofactor myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) prevents its translocation to the nucleus where it binds and activates SRF. MYPN was found to bind and bundle filamentous actin as well as interact with MRTF-A. In particular, while MYPN reduced actin polymerization, it strongly inhibited actin depolymerization and consequently increased MRTF-A-mediated activation of SRF signalling in myogenic cells.

Attention control groups receive the same dose of interpersonal interaction as intervention participants but no other elements of the intervention, to control for the benefits of attention that may come from behavioral interventions. Because intervention success is analyzed compared to control conditions, it is useful to examine attention control content and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to report on attention control visit activities and their perceived benefit in a randomized control trial. The trial tested an aging-in-place intervention comprised of a series of participant goal-directed visits facilitated by an occupational therapist, nurse, and handyman. The attention control group participants received visits from a lay person. We report on the number and length of visits received, types of visit activities that participants chose, and how much visit time was spent on each activity, based on the attention visitor's records.

LMNA mutations lead to degenerative disorders known as laminopathies, including the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. In addition, altered lamin A/C expression is found in various cancers. Reports indicate that lamin A/C plays a role in DNA double strand break repair, but a role in DNA base excision repair (BER) has not been described. We provide evidence for reduced BER efficiency in lamin A/C-depleted cells (Lmna null MEFs and lamin A/C-knockdown U2OS). The mechanism involves impairment of the APE1 and POLβ BER activities, partly effectuated by associated reduction in poly-ADP-ribose chain formation. Also, Lmna null MEFs displayed reduced expression of several core BER enzymes (PARP1, LIG3 and POLβ). Absence of Lmna led to accumulation of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, and to an increased frequency of substitution mutations induced by chronic oxidative stress including GC&gt;TA transversions (a fingerprint of 8-oxoG:A mismatches). Collectively, our results provide novel insights into the functional interplay between the nuclear lamina and cellular defenses against oxidative DNA damage, with implications for cancer and aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Senescence marker protein 30 knockout mice with genetic VC deficiency were fed a diet containing the recommended VC content (20 mg/kg per d; 0·02 %VC group) or a high VC content (200 mg/kg per d; 0·2 %VC group) for 2 months, then dexamethasone was given by intraperitoneal injection. After administration of dexamethasone, the plasma ascorbic acid concentration decreased significantly in the 0·02 %VC group and was unchanged in wild-type C57BL/6 mice on a VC-deficient diet (wild-type group), while it was significantly higher in the 0·2 %VC group compared with the other two groups. In the 0·02 %VC and wild-type groups, dexamethasone caused a significant decrease in the cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells among splenocytes as well as a significant decrease in IL-2, IL-12p40 and interferon-γ protein production by splenocytes and a significant decrease in T-cell proliferation among splenocytes. In the 0·2 %VC group, these dexamethasone-induced immunosuppression improved when compared with the other two groups. In addition, reduction in the intracellular levels of ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase and glutathione in splenocytes by dexamethasone as well as elevation in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were significantly suppressed in the 0·2 %VC group.

Most brain aging studies are focused on neurons and less on astrocytes which are the most abundant cells in the brain known to be in charge of various functions including the maintenance of brain physical formation, ion homeostasis, and secretion of various extracellular matrix proteins. Altered mitochondrial dynamics, defective mitophagy or mitochondrial damages are causative factors of mitochondrial dysfunction, which is linked to age-related disorders. Etoposide is an anti-cancer reagent which can induce DNA stress and cellular senescence of cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether etoposide induces senescence and functional alterations in cultured rat astrocytes. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity was used as a cellular senescence marker. The results indicated that etoposide-treated astrocytes showed cellular senescence phenotypes including increased SA-β-gal-positive cells number, increased nuclear size and increased senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) such as IL-6. We also observed a decreased expression of cell cycle markers, including Phospho- Histone H3/Histone H3 and CDK2, and dysregulation of cellular functions based on wound-healing, neuronal protection, and phagocytosis assays. Finally, mitochondrial dysfunction was noted through the determination of mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and the measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR). These data suggest that etoposide can induce cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes which may have implications in brain aging and neurodegenerative conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Staying at home is an important determinant of health and well-being. As care needs increase, the quality of community support which older people receive directly influences their capacity to remain in their own homes. While many are supported informally by family carers, formal support provided by home care workers often enables them to remain at home for longer period. However, providing community-based care for people with dementia can be challenging. Workers often lack training in dementia-specific care for clients with increasingly complex needs, and typically work without direct supervision. As the demand for person-centred home care for people with dementia increases, specialist dementia training for home care workers is urgently needed. In this qualitative study, we used in-depth interviews of a purposive sample, comprising 15 family carers and four older people with dementia, to understand the experience of receiving community care. Data analysis was guided by Braun and Clarke's approach to thematic analysis and revealed the following five overlapping themes, relating to home care workers' understanding of dementia, person-centred care, communication and rapport, mutual collaboration, and the influence of organisational constraints on continuity of care. Although participants acknowledged that service providers operated under challenging circumstances, they were frustrated with home care workers' lack of dementia knowledge and inconsistent staff rostering. Conversely, an understanding of the lived experience of dementia, effective communication and rapport, and continuity of care contributed significantly to a positive experience of receiving care. The findings of this study will be used to inform the essential elements of a training program aimed at enabling and empowering a skilled, specialist home care workforce to support older people with dementia to live well at home for as long as possible.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, local bone marrow Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels can reach high concentrations, at least transiently, due to bone resorption, which is one of the notable features of the bone marrow stroma. Bone homeostasis is maintained by both the balance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption and the balance of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes. It has been reported that under culture conditions of infrequent adipocyte differentiation (no treatment with insulin or dexamethasone), high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances osteoblast but not adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow stromal cells. In contrast, under culture conditions of predominant adipocyte differentiation (treatment with insulin and dexamethasone), high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances adipocyte but not osteoblast accumulation in bone marrow stromal cells. Thus, the increased extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused by bone resorption might enhance osteoblast development to reform missing bone under conditions of infrequent adipocyte differentiation (such as the normal physiological state) and might accelerate adipocyte accumulation instead of osteoblastic bone formation under conditions of predominant adipocyte differentiation (such as aging, obesity, use of glucocorticoids, and postmenopause). Moreover, increased adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow suppresses lymphohematopoiesis and contributes to a dysfunction of osteogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Freshly isolated DCs from young males exhibited less mature phenotype and greater endocytic capacity compared with those from age-matched females. Upon LPS stimulation in vitro they were less potent in stimulating allogeneic CD4+ cells in mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), due to lower expression of MHC II, and greater NO and IL-10 production. In accordance with higher TGF-β production, young male rat DCs were less potent in stimulating IL-17 production in MLR than those from young females. Irrespective of sex, endocytic capacity and responsiveness of DCs to LPS stimulation in culture, judging by their allostimulatory capacity in MLR decreased with age, reflecting decline in MHC II surface density followed by their greater NO production; the effects more prominent in females. Additionally, compared with LPS-stimulated DCs from young rats, those from sex-matched aged rats were more potent in stimulating IL-10 production in MLR, whereas capacity of DCs from aged female and male rats to stimulate IL-17 production remained unaltered and decreased, respectively. This reflected age-related shift in IL-6/TGF-β production level ratio in LPS-stimulated DC cultures towards TGF-β, and sex-specific age-related remodeling CD4+ cell cytokine pathways. Additionally, compared with LPS-stimulated DCs from young rats, those cells from sex-matched aged rats were less potent in stimulating IFN-γ production in MLR, the effect particularly prominent in MLRs encompassing male rat DCs.

The length of telomeres is known to shorten with each cell division and it is well-established that telomere attrition is related to replicative capacity in vitro. Moreover, telomere loss is also correlated with the process of aging in vivo. That is why we aimed to find any associations of leukocyte telomere shortening with different age groups. We enrolled 291 healthy people in a study group. Samples of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes were purified by the DNA salting-out method. The genotyping was carried out using the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were assessed using the statistical analysis software ''IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0'. To determine the relationship between the leukocyte telomere length and single nucleotide polymorphisms of TERT and TRF1 and the age of healthy individuals. The relative leukocyte telomere length (T/S) measurement was performed in study subjects and compared between different age groups.

Data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2011. The males, those who were educated, the young-old (aged between 65 and 74 years), urban dwellers, and living in institutions were more likely to participate in all three activities frequently. Frequent or occasional participation in these three activities was negatively associated with feelings of loneliness. The longitudinal study from 2005 to 2011 showed that respondents who frequently played cards/mahjong at baseline were less likely to feel persistent loneliness at the end of the 2011 wave. Instead, frequently watching TV/listening to the radio in 2008 was associated with lower odds in feeling persistent loneliness at the end of 2011. Hence, active participation in playing cards/mahjong and TV/radio entertainment can be effective treatment intervention against persistent loneliness among older Chinese. For the Chinese, a leisure activity steeped in a nation's culture and heritage, such as playing mahjong, may be used as an intervention strategy to prevent and alleviate chronic loneliness among older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Environmental stresses induce cellular senescence in a variety of eukaryotes. Here we showed that intracellular proline regulates the replicative lifespan in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Deletion of the proline oxidase gene <i>PUT1</i> and expression of the γ-glutamate kinase mutant gene <i>PRO1-I150T</i> that is less sensitive to feedback inhibition accumulated proline and extended the replicative lifespan of yeast cells. Inversely, disruption of the proline biosynthetic genes <i>PRO1, PRO2</i>, and <i>CAR2</i> decreased stationary proline level and shortened the lifespan of yeast cells. Quadruple disruption of the proline transporter genes unexpectedly did not change intracellular proline levels and replicative lifespan. Overexpression of the stress-responsive transcription activator gene <i>MSN2</i> reduced intracellular proline levels by inducing the expression of <i>PUT1</i>, resulting in a short lifespan. Thus, the intracellular proline levels at stationary phase was positively correlated with the replicative lifespan. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of amino acids in yeast mutants deficient in proline metabolism showed characteristic metabolic profiles coincident with longevity: acidic and basic amino acids and branched-chain amino acids positively contributed to the replicative lifespan. These results allude to proline metabolism having a physiological role in maintaining the lifespan of yeast cells.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, the role of chemotherapy on T cell regeneration needs further elucidation in light of novel immunotherapies that have become standard of care for many elderly cancer patients. We used next-generation immunosequencing to study T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire metrics on 346 blood samples from healthy individuals and cancer patients producing a dataset with around 8.8 million TCR reads. This analysis showed that decline of T cell diversity and increase in T cell clonality is a continuous process beginning in healthy individuals over 40 years of age. Untreated patients with both hematological and solid tumors showed blood TCR repertoires with significantly lower diversity and higher clonality as compared to healthy individuals across all decades. Loss in T cell diversity was essentially driven by a loss in richness in aging healthy individuals, while in cancer patients a loss in repertoire evenness was an additional contributing factor. Interestingly, chemotherapy did not impair the regeneration of blood TCR repertoire diversity to pre-treatment age-specific levels. Surprisingly, even patients over the age of 70 years receiving highly T cell toxic therapies reestablished their pre-treatment T cell diversity suggesting rebound thymic activity rather than recovery of T cell counts by peripheral expansion only. Taken together, these data suggest that human TCR repertoire metrics gradually deteriorate in the aging individual, but age-specific TCR metrics are restored after T cell depleting therapy even in elderly cancer patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The ulcers are often accompanied by pain. Standard of care fails to heal ∼50% of diabetic foot ulcers and 25% of venous leg ulcers. Even advanced therapies do not heal &gt;60%. Thus there is an unmet need for novel therapies that promote healing and also address the concomitant pain issue. <b>Recent Advances:</b> Prolotherapy involves injection of small amounts of an irritant material to the site of degenerated or painful joints, ligaments, and tendons. Multiple irritants are reported to be efficacious, but the focus here is on dextrose prolotherapy. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies support translation to clinical use. Concentrations as low as 5% dextrose have resulted in production of growth factors that have critical roles in repair. Numerous clinical trials report pro-reparative effects of dextrose prolotherapy in joint diseases, tendon, and ligament damage, and for painful musculoskeletal issues. However, most of the studies have limitations that result in low-quality evidence. <b>Critical Issues:</b> The preclinical data support a role for dextrose prolotherapy in promoting tissue repair that is required for healing chronic wounds and ameliorating the associated pain. Critical issues include provision of evidence of efficacy in human chronic wounds. Another potential obstacle is limitation of reimbursement by third-party payers for a therapy with as yet limited evidence. <b>Future Directions:</b> Preclinical studies in models of chronic wounds would support clinical translation. As dextrose prolotherapy has some mechanistic similarities to already approved honey therapies, it may have a shortened pathway for clinical translation. The gold standard for widespread adoption would be a well-designed clinical trial.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The primary treatment strategy for osteoporotic fractures is surgery; however, the compromised and comminuted bones in osteoporotic fracture sites are not conducive to optimum reduction and rigid fixation. In addition, these patients always exhibit accompanying aging-related disorders, including high inflammatory status, decreased mechanical loading and abnormal skeletal metabolism, which are disadvantages for fracture healing around sites that have undergone orthopedic procedures. Since the incidence of osteoporosis is expected to increase worldwide, orthopedic surgeons should pay more attention to comprehensive strategies for improving the poor prognosis of osteoporotic fractures. Herein, we highlight the molecular basis of osteoimmunology and bone mechanosensation in different healing phases of elderly osteoporotic fractures, guiding perioperative management to alleviate the unfavorable effects of insufficient mechanical loading, high inflammatory levels and pathogen infection. The well-informed pharmacologic and surgical intervention, including treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and sufficient application of antibiotics, as well as bench-to-bedside strategies for bone augmentation and hardware selection, should be made according to a comprehensive understanding of bone biomechanical properties in addition to the remodeling status of osteoporotic bones, which is necessary for creating proper biological and mechanical environments for bone union and remodeling.

Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of lipid metabolism in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several lipid classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty acids. This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty acids. The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and lipid homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change lipid concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in mitochondria, thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Fibroblasts are present in most tissues and contribute to wound healing<sup>2,3</sup>. They are also the most widely used cell type for reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, a process that has implications for regenerative medicine and rejuvenation strategies<sup>4</sup>. Here we show that fibroblast cultures from old mice secrete inflammatory cytokines and exhibit increased variability in the efficiency of iPS cell reprogramming between mice. Variability between individuals is emerging as a feature of old age<sup>5-8</sup>, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To identify drivers of this variability, we performed multi-omics profiling of fibroblast cultures from young and old mice that have different reprogramming efficiencies. This approach revealed that fibroblast cultures from old mice contain 'activated fibroblasts' that secrete inflammatory cytokines, and that the proportion of activated fibroblasts in a culture correlates with the reprogramming efficiency of that culture. Experiments in which conditioned medium was swapped between cultures showed that extrinsic factors secreted by activated fibroblasts underlie part of the variability between mice in reprogramming efficiency, and we have identified inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, as key contributors. Notably, old mice also exhibited variability in wound healing rate in vivo. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified distinct subpopulations of fibroblasts with different cytokine expression and signalling in the wounds of old mice with slow versus fast healing rates. Hence, a shift in fibroblast composition, and the ratio of inflammatory cytokines that they secrete, may drive the variability between mice in reprogramming in vitro and influence wound healing rate in vivo. This variability may reflect distinct stochastic ageing trajectories between individuals, and could help in developing personalized strategies to improve iPS cell generation and wound healing in elderly individuals.</AbstractText>"}

Although tissue-specific changes in autophagy and ageing have been extensively explored, the mechanism underlying the inter-tissue regulation of autophagy with ageing is poorly understood. Here, we show that a secreted microRNA, mir-83/miR-29, controls the age-related decrease in macroautophagy across tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans. Upregulated in the intestine by hsf-1/HSF1 with age, mir-83 is transported across tissues potentially via extracellular vesicles and disrupts macroautophagy by suppressing CUP-5/MCOLN, a vital autophagy regulator, autonomously in the intestine as well as non-autonomously in body wall muscle. Mutating mir-83 thereby enhances macroautophagy in different tissues, promoting protein homeostasis and longevity. These findings thus identify a microRNA-based mechanism to coordinate the decreasing macroautophagy in various tissues with age.</AbstractText>"}

In contrast to agar environments that pose specific drawbacks for characterization of C. elegans burrowing ability, here we use the optically transparent and biocompatible Pluronic F-127 gel that transitions from liquid to gel at room temperature, enabling convenient and safe handling of animals. The burrowing assay methodology involves loading animals at the bottom of well plates, casting a liquid-phase of Pluronic on top that solidifies via a modest temperature upshift, enticing animals to reach the surface via chemotaxis to food, and quantifying the relative success animals have in reaching the chemoattractant. We study the influence of Pluronic concentration, gel height and chemoattractant choice to optimize assay performance. To demonstrate the simplicity of the assay workflow and versatility, we show its novel application in multiple areas including (i) evaluating muscle mutants with defects in dense bodies and/or M-lines (pfn-3, atn-1, uig-1, dyc-1, zyx-1, unc-95 and tln-1), (ii) tuning assay conditions to reveal changes in the mutant gei-8, (iii) sorting of fast burrowers in a genetically-uniform wild-type population for later quantitation of their distinct muscle gene expression, and (iv) testing proteotoxic animal models of Huntington and Parkinson's disease.

Prior studies have reported a decreased anticorrelation between the DMN and the DAN in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it is unclear how this anticorrelation changes as MCI progresses to AD. We hypothesized that dysfunctional connectivity between the DMN and DAN may reflect the gradual decline from MCI to AD. To test this hypothesis, we investigated alterations in functional connectivity between the DMN and DAN in subtypes of amnestic MCI (aMCI) by comparing with the same functional pattern in healthy elderly individuals and patients with AD. We retrospectively collected brain imaging and neuropsychological data from 20 AD participants, 22 participants with multiple-domain aMCI (aMCI-m), 29 participants with single-domain aMCI (aMCI-s) and 23 sex-matched normal controls in this study. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that aMCI-s and aMCI-m groups demonstrated different magnitudes of increased anticorrelation between the DMN and DAN relative to the AD group. Furthermore, in aMCI-s, aMCI-m and AD participants, hypoconnectivity was found in specific regions within the DMN, including the precuneus and angular gyrus, and hyperconnectivity was found in areas outside the typical DMN networks, including the middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus and visual cortex, which indicated disease-related adaptations of brain networks. Our findings suggest that DMN-DAN anticorrelation may shed light on the understanding of the adaptations in brain function during the progression from MCI to AD and may serve as a potential biomarker to detect AD in the preclinical stage.</AbstractText>"}

The lncRNA 'highly upregulated in liver cancer' (HULC) promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by mechanisms that are not fully understood. In the present study, we showed that HULC is overexpressed in HCC tissues, which correlates with an unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. We also found that HULC promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells <i>in vitro</i>, and xenograft tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Our mechanistic studies showed that HULC works as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-2052, and that the MET receptor tyrosine kinase is a downstream target of miR-2052 in HCC. Furthermore, HULC inhibits miR-2052, thereby stimulating MET expression in HCC. Finally, MET overexpression reverses the effects of HULC depletion. In sum, our findings reveal a novel regulatory signaling cascade, the HULC/miR-2052/MET axis, which could potentially be exploited for therapeutic benefits in the treatment of HCC.</AbstractText>"}

As such, behavioral management programs aimed at refining the care of an aging captive chimpanzee population have become increasingly important. However, little research exists that addresses the ways in which captive chimpanzee behavior differs as a function of the interaction of age and aspects of the captive environment. We examined overall differences in behavior between elderly (35 y and older) and nonelderly (younger than 35 y) captive chimpanzees. Elderly chimpanzees exhibited significantly more rough scratching (a behavioral indicator of anxiety) and inactivity, less behavioral diversity, and less affiliation than their nonelderly counterparts. We also assessed whether elderly chimpanzee behavior and wounding rates differed as a function of housing in geriatric (group average age, 35 y or older) or nongeriatric (group average age, younger than 35 y) groups. In our program, geriatric social groups were characterized by smaller group size, more females within the group, and higher levels of individual mobility impairment compared with nongeriatric groups. Furthermore, elderly chimpanzees housed in geriatric groups displayed significantly increased rough scratching, decreased locomotion and submission than nongeriatric animals but no difference in wounding. These findings suggest that housing elderly chimpanzees in nongeriatric groups may be beneficial, given that doing so may stimulate locomotion. However, the establishment and maintenance of geriatric groups may be unavoidable as the demographics of the population of captive former research chimpanzees continues to age. Therefore, refinements to captive geriatric care strategies for chimpanzees should focus on methods of evaluating and enhancing functionally appropriate captive environments within geriatric groups.</AbstractText>"}

This prospective study aims to investigate the association between inflammatory markers and the risk of CVE in a population of 2659 older adults, enrolled in the Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.), with depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, or both conditions. For each individual, we assessed at baseline the presence of depressive symptoms (defined as a Geriatric Depression Scale ≥11), cognitive impairment (defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination &lt;24), and serum levels of fibrinogen, white blood cells (WBC), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). During a 4.4-year follow-up, 188 (7.1%) participants had CVE. Among the inflammatory markers, high fibrinogen values were associated with a 50% higher risk of CVE in the whole sample, and with a 4-fold higher risk in individuals with both depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment (hazard ratio = 4.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.45-11.23). Elevated WBC were associated with a 5% higher risk of CVE in the whole sample and in those with both conditions. No significant association was observed with the ESR. In conclusion, our study found that high fibrinogen levels may predict the risk of CVE in older people with concomitant depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment. Therefore, fibrinogen could be considered as an easily accessible aging biomarker, which might estimate the chronic inflammatory status and its potential detrimental effects on the most vulnerable older adults.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we tried to examine the combined effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) preconditioning and melatonin postconditioning on cardioprotection and mitochondrial function in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of aged male rats. Sixty aged Wistar rats were randomly allocated to 5 groups, including sham, control, NMN-receiving, melatonin-receiving, and combined therapy (NMN+melatonin). Isolated hearts were mounted on Langendorff apparatus and then underwent 30-minue ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery to induce regional ischemic insult, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (100 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) was administered for every other day for 28 days before I/R. Melatonin added to perfusion solution, 5 minutes prior to the reperfusion up to 15 minutes early reperfusion. Myocardial hemodynamic and infarct size (IS) were measured, and the left ventricles samples were obtained to evaluate cardiac mitochondrial function and oxidative stress markers. Melatonin postconditioning and NMN had significant cardioprotective effects in aged rats; they could improve hemodynamic parameters and reduce IS and lactate dehydrogenase release compared to those of control group. Moreover, pretreatment with NMN increased the cardioprotection by melatonin. All treatments reduced oxidative stress and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and improved mitochondrial membrane potential and restored NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. The effects of combined therapy on reduction of mitochondrial ROS and oxidative status and improvement of mitochondrial membrane potential were greater than those of alone treatments. Combination of melatonin and NMN can be a promising strategy to attenuate myocardial I/R damages in aged hearts. Restoration of mitochondrial function may substantially contribute to this cardioprotection.</AbstractText>"}

We showed earlier that social exclusion encumbered self-initiated actions in the Cyberball task in young adults. Here, we examined whether the behavioral performance and regional responses during self-initiated actions vary with age in 53 participants (21-74 years; 27 men). Behaviorally, participants were slower in tossing the ball during exclusion (EX) than during fair game (FG) sessions in both men and women. In women but not in men the reaction time (RT) burden (RT_EX - RT_FG; RT prolonged during social exclusion) of ball toss was positively correlated with age despite no observed sex difference in Social Interaction Anxiety Scale scores. The pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, left occipital cortex (OC) and left insula/orbitofrontal cortex responded to ball toss in EX vs. FG in negative correlation with age in women but not in men. Further, the activation of left OC fully mediated the relationship between age and RT burden in women. Thus, older women are more encumbered in self-initiated action during social exclusion, although this behavioral burden is not reflected in subjective reports of social anxiety. Age-related diminution in OC activities may reflect the neural processes underlying the difficulty in initiating social interactions in women. Together, the findings identified age-sensitive behavioral and neural processes of self-initiated action in the Cyberball task and suggest the importance of considering age and sex differences in studies of social interaction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, specific sensory stimulation via electroacupuncture (EA) therapy may attenuate this loss by promoting the expression of endogenous neurotrophic factors in a manner similar to physical therapy. We investigated the potential protective effects of EA on dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of PD and whether these effects are associated with the promotion of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Mouse models of PD were generated using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine. Motor performance was assessed using behavioral tests, and Western blot experiments, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunohistochemical assays were performed. In both mouse models, EA treatment ameliorated motor impairments and dopaminergic neuron loss; these changes were accompanied by increases in BDNF and GDNF. In the MPTP group, EA treatment improved motor dysfunction by attenuating dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra, similar to the effects of levodopa. EA treatment significantly upregulated BDNF and GDNF expression in both the substantia nigra and striatum. Moreover, EA treatment induced the expression of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) as well as Akt and Pitx3 in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, levodopa treatment did not induce BDNF/GDNF activation or related signaling factors. Thus, EA therapy may exert protective effects on dopaminergic neurons by upregulating the expression of BDNF, GDNF, and related signaling factors, thereby improving motor function. Hence, EA may represent an effective adjuvant therapy for motor deficits in patients with PD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent work has also highlighted a potential interaction between different metal species and various components of the cytoskeletal network in the brain, which themselves have a reported role in age-related degenerative disease and other neurological disorders. Neurofilaments are one such class of intermediate filament protein that have a demonstrated capacity to bind and utilise cation species. In this study, we investigated the consequences of altering the neurofilamentous network on metal ion homeostasis by examining neurofilament light (NFL) gene knockout mice, relative to wildtype control animals, at adulthood (5 months of age) and advanced age (22 months). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy demonstrated that the concentrations of iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) varied across brain regions and peripheral nerve samples. Zn and Fe showed statistically significant interactions between genotype and age, as well as between genotype and region, and Cu demonstrated a genotype and region interaction. The most substantial difference between genotypes was found in Fe in the older animals, where, across many regions examined, there was elevated Fe in the NFL knockout mice. This data indicates a potential relationship between the neurofilamentous cytoskeleton and the processing and/or storage of Fe through ageing.</AbstractText>"}

Of the various deterioration issues in bridges, one of the most common and costly is malfunctioning of expansion joints, connecting two bridge spans, due to accumulation of debris and dirt in the joint. Although expansion joints are small components of bridges' superstructure, their malfunction can result in major structural problems and when coupled with thermal stresses, the demand on the structural elements could be further amplified. Intuitively, these additional demands are expected to even worsen if one considers potential future temperature rise due to climate change. Indeed, it has been speculated that climate change is likely to have negative effect on bridges worldwide. However, to date there has been no serious attempts to quantify this effect on a larger spatial scale with no studies pertaining to the integrity of the main load carrying girders. In this study, we attempt to quantify the effect of clogged joints and climate change on failure of the superstructure of a class of steel bridges around the U.S. We surprisingly find that potentially most of the main load carrying girders, in the analyzed bridges, could reach their ultimate capacity when subjected to service load and future climate changes. We further discover that out of nine U.S. regions, the most vulnerable bridges, in a descending order, are those located in the Northern Rockies &amp; Plains, Northwest and Upper Midwest. Ultimately, this study proposes an approach to establish a priority order of bridge maintenance and repair to manage limited funding among a vast inventory in an era of climate change.</AbstractText>"}

Using experimental OA protocol and transgenic <i>Cdkn2a</i><sup>+/luc</sup> and <i>Cdkn2a</i><sup>luc/luc</sup> mice, we found that the senescence-driving p16<sup>INK4a</sup> is a marker of the disease, expressed by the synovial tissue, but is also an actor: its somatic deletion partially protects against cartilage degeneration. We test whether by becoming senescent, the mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), found in the synovial tissue and sub-chondral bone marrow, can contribute to OA development. We established an <i>in vitro</i> p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-positive senescence model on human MSCs. Upon senescence induction, their intrinsic stem cell properties are altered. When co-cultured with OA chondrocytes, senescent MSC show also a seno-suppressive properties impairment favoring tissue degeneration. To evaluate <i>in vivo</i> the effects of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-senescent MSC on healthy cartilage, we rely on the SAMP8 mouse model of accelerated senescence that develops spontaneous OA. MSCs isolated from these mice expressed p16<sup>INK4a</sup>.

In advanced age cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction impairs NVC responses, which contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Recently, we have shown that pharmacological treatments that attenuate mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provide significant neurovascular protection, improving NVC responses in aged mice. Transgenic mice that overexpress human catalase localized to the mitochondria (mCAT) are protected from age-related mitochondrial oxidative stress and exhibit a longevity phenotype associated with resistance to several age-related pathologies. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that mitochondria-targeted overexpression of catalase also confers protection against age-related impairment of NVC responses. To achieve this goal, NVC responses were assessed in aged (24 months old) mCAT mice and compared with those in age-matched wild-type mice and young control mice by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that mitochondrial overexpression of catalase resulted in improved NVC in aged mice due to preserved NO-mediated (L-NAME inhibitable) component of the response. Thus, our present and previous findings demonstrate that interventions that boost mitochondrial antioxidative defenses confer significant cerebromicrovascular protective effects, which preserve NVC responses in aged mice. Our findings provide additional proof-of-concept for the potential use of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants as therapy for prevention of vascular cognitive impairment associated with aging.</AbstractText>"}

We examine the limited available literature that suggests PDE4 expression does not change in AD brains together with reports that show PDE4 inhibition as an effective treatment in this age-related neurodegenerative disease. Actually, aging induces changes in PDE4 expression/activity in an isoform and brain-region specific manner that proposes a similar complexity in AD brains.

In response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response pathway, that has a dualistic role, is induced. The unfolded protein response can restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis by degradation of unfolded proteins, inhibition of translation, and mobilization of chaperons, but it can also promote apoptosis when endoplasmic reticulum stress is prolonged. The unfolded protein response signaling pathways may be activated via three transmembrane receptors such as: PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. The most promising for development of new therapies of many human diseases, in particular cancer and neurodegeneration is PERK pathway, that inhibition shows positive therapeutic effects both in in vitro and in vivo studies.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we compared the preservation of tissue-resident stem cells using our ECF solution with that using three other solutions: PBS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Euro-Collins solution. These solutions represent a common buffer, a common culture medium and a benchmark organ-preservation solution, respectively. Lung tissues were removed from mice and preserved for 72 h under low-temperature conditions. Of the solutions tested, only preservation in the ECF-type solution could maintain the proliferation and differentiation capacity of mouse lung tissue-resident stem cells. In addition, the ECF solution could preserve the viability and proliferation of human alveolar epithelial progenitor cells when stored for more than 7 days at 4 °C.

Details concerning implementation in clinical practice are frequently lacking. The aim was to describe the output of one such CP program and to identify factors associated with CP recommendations. <b>Methods</b>: A CP program was installed at three acute geriatric wards in a teaching hospital. A convenience sample was collected, consisting of inpatients who received a CP consultation at discharge. Medical conditions, patient demographics, and drug use were evaluated retrospectively. Number and type of the CP recommendations were determined. A Poisson regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with the number of CP recommendations. <b>Results</b>: A cohort of 524 patients, aged 85 (interquartile range (IQR): 82-89) years was included. On admission, 10.31 (standard deviation: 4.49) drugs were taken. Three (IQR: 2-4) CP recommendations were provided per patient, of which 70.2% targeted drug discontinuation. A model was derived, containing the following factors: number of drugs on admission (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.063; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.052-1.074), number of previous contacts with the geriatric department (IRR: 0.869; 95%CI: 0.816-0.926), presence of left-ventricular dysfunction (IRR: 1.179, 95% CI: 1.023-1.360), the number of new drugs (IRR: 1.046; 95% CI: 1.021-1.071) and use of colecalciferol (IRR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.088-1.367). <b>Conclusions</b>: Five factors were associated with the number of CP recommendations at discharge.

Dietary restriction is the most effective experimental intervention known to consistently slow the aging process and with positive effects on health span in different organisms, from invertebrates to mammals. Age is also associated with progressive decline in physical activity levels in a wide range of animal species: therefore, regular physical exercise could represent a safe intervention to antagonize aging. In this research we explore the effects of exercise training initiated in late middle aged rats fed with different lifelong dietary regimens: one group was fed ad libitum and the second group was subjected to every-other-day fasting. These two groups might represent examples of 'normal' aging and 'successful' aging. The study shows the effects of exercise and food restriction and their interaction on plasma levels of total antioxidant capacity, lactate, amino acids, and on products of protein oxidation in soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. In addition, we evaluated body composition measurement by bioelectrical impedance analysis and muscle strength by grasping test. Results show that late-onset exercise training has the potential to improve some metabolic and physiological parameters in rats with the same 'chronological age' but different 'biological age', without negative effects, and highlight the relevance of a personalised and selected exercise protocol, since the responsiveness to exercise may depend on the individual's 'biological age'.</AbstractText>"}

The objective of this study was to compare the longitudinal change in preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion as well as estrous cycle in individual C57BL/6 J female mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Amplitude and timing of LH secretion at the surge were similar from 3 to 9 months but were altered in 12-month old mice with a significant decrease of more than 50% of peak LH value and a 2 h delay in the occurrence of the LH surge as compared to younger mice. The analysis of two to three successive LH surges at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months showed low and similar intra-individual variability at all ages. The estrous cycle length and intra/inter variability were stable over the age. This study shows that female mice in regular environmental conditions display stable LH surge timing and amplitude up to 9 months, but at 12 months, the LH surge is delayed with a reduced amplitude, however without overt modification in the estrous cycles. Analysis of individual preovulatory LH secretion and estrous cycle indicates that mice can be followed up to 9 months to investigate the detrimental effects of various parameters on mouse reproductive activity.</AbstractText>"}

Age-associated cognitive decline is a hallmark of aging and the increase in oxidative stress/damage with age is one of the mechanisms proposed for cognitive decline with age. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if Sod1KO mice exhibit an accelerated loss in cognitive function similar to that observed in aged animals. Cognition was assessed in Sod1KO and wild type (WT) mice using an automated home-cage testing apparatus (Noldus PhenoTyper) that included an initial discrimination and reversal task. Comparison of the total distance moved by the mice during light and dark phases of the study demonstrated that the Sod1KO mice do not show a deficit in movement. Assessment of cognitive function showed no significant difference between Sod1KO and WT mice during the initial discrimination phase of learning. However, during the reversal task, Sod1KO mice showed a significantly greater number of incorrect entries compared to WT mice indicating a decline in cognition similar to that observed in aged animals. Markers of oxidative stress (4-Hydroxynonenal, 4-HNE) and neuroinflammation [proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL-1β) and neuroinflammatory markers (CD68, TLR4, and MCP1)] were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of male and female Sod1KO compared to WT mice. This study provides important evidence that increases in oxidative stress alone are sufficient to induce neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction that parallels the memory deficits seen in advanced aging and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Where the evidence-base was limited or of low quality, Consensus Based Recommendations (CBRs) were formulated.

Recommendations for Screening and Assessment: The task force recommends that health practitioners case identify/screen all older adults for frailty using a validated instrument suitable for the specific setting or context (strong recommendation). Ideally, the screening instrument should exclude disability as part of the screening process. For individuals screened as positive for frailty, a more comprehensive clinical assessment should be performed to identify signs and underlying mechanisms of frailty (strong recommendation). Recommendations for Management: A comprehensive care plan for frailty should address polypharmacy (whether rational or nonrational), the management of sarcopenia, the treatable causes of weight loss, and the causes of exhaustion (depression, anaemia, hypotension, hypothyroidism, and B12 deficiency) (strong recommendation). All persons with frailty should receive social support as needed to address unmet needs and encourage adherence to a comprehensive care plan (strong recommendation). First-line therapy for the management of frailty should include a multi-component physical activity programme with a resistance-based training component (strong recommendation).

However, stretchable electronics with enhanced heat dissipation have been rarely reported. In this study, a stretchable laminated nanocomposite-based conductor with both robust electric conductivity and enhanced thermal management capability was fabricated. With the optimized GNRs and BNNS contents, this conductor exhibited a thermal conductivity enhancement of 266%, leading to a decrease in the working temperature from 57.4 °C to 29.2 °C. Even under 100% strain, the fluctuation of the equilibrium operational temperature was within 10%. Moreover, the conductor showed outstanding electric performance under 200% strain with an R/R<sub>0</sub> value of 1.46. Whether stretched and tested in a Moebius-belt shape or under hard-environmental conditions such as in seawater, crude oil, and even integrated in a wireless charging circuit, the significant reliability of this conductor was recorded. Thus, our results are promising to provide a practical approach for the fabrication of stretchable electronic devices working in high temperature environments associated with extreme thermal stresses and under extreme circumstances such as sea rescue operations and marine oil pollution remediation.</AbstractText>"}

Myopia also associates with elongated axial length, and such ellipsoid shape of the eyeball strongly contributes its pathogenesis. Morphological features of the eyeballs, which could be important factors for developing glaucoma, have not been well described. The aim of this study was to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) topographic features of glaucomatous eyeballs with/without myopia to evaluate the potential of those features for predicting glaucoma. Using a 3.0-tesla MRI, volume-isotropic turbo-spin-echo acquisition T2-weighted images were obtained from 55 patients with glaucoma and 22 controls to delineate the eyeballs. Eyeball volumes, axial lengths and transverse lengths were semi-automatically calculated and compared between four groups: normal, myopia, glaucoma, and glaucoma with myopia. Both glaucoma and myopia increased the eyeball volume compared to the normal eyes. An increased anisotropy ratio (axial/transversus length) was observed in myopic eyes compared to normal, whereas in the glaucomatous eyes, with or without myopia, no increase in anisotropy ratio was observed. Increasing volume of eyes can be caused by myopia and glaucoma. Myopic eyes were ellipsoid in shape, but there was less anisotropy and a near-spherical shape in glaucomatous eyes, even in glaucomatous myopic eyes.</AbstractText>"}

Atypical antipsychotics, first developed for schizophrenia, are commonly used in AD + P, suggesting shared mechanisms. Despite this implication, little empirical research has been conducted to examine whether there are mechanistic similarities between AD + P and schizophrenia. In this study, we tested whether polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia was associated with AD + P. Schizophrenia PRS was calculated using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium data at ten GWAS p value thresholds (P<sub>T</sub>) in 3111 AD cases from 11 cohort studies characterized for psychosis using validated, standardized tools. Association between PRS and AD + P status was tested by logistic regression in each cohort individually and the results meta-analyzed. The schizophrenia PRS was associated with AD + P at an optimum P<sub>T</sub> of 0.01. The strongest association was for delusions where a one standard deviation increase in PRS was associated with a 1.18-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.06-1.3; p = 0.001). These new findings point towards psychosis in AD-and particularly delusions-sharing some genetic liability with schizophrenia and support a transdiagnostic view of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan.</AbstractText>"}

This model has been instrumental in understanding the events that lead to the initiation of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity. Though EAE has been an effective screening tool for identifying novel therapies for relapsing-remitting MS, it has proven to be less successful in identifying therapies for progressive forms of this disease. Though axon injury occurs in EAE, it is rapid and acute, making it difficult to intervene for the purpose of evaluating neuroprotective therapies. Here, we describe a variant of spontaneous EAE in the 2D2 T cell receptor transgenic mouse (2D2<sup>+</sup> mouse) that presents with hind-limb clasping upon tail suspension and is associated with T cell-mediated inflammation in the posterior spinal cord and spinal nerve roots. Due to the mild nature of clinical signs in this model, we were able to maintain cohorts of mice into middle age. Over 9 mo, these mice exhibited a relapsing-remitting course of hind-limb clasping with the development of progressive motor deficits. Using a combined approach of ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histopathological analysis, we observed neurological progression to associate with spinal cord atrophy, synapse degradation, and neuron loss in the gray matter, as well as ongoing axon injury in the white matter of the spinal cord. These findings suggest that mild EAE coupled with natural aging may be a solution to better modeling the neurodegenerative processes seen in MS.</AbstractText>"}

This has led to the paradigm that avoiding vit-D deficiency is important to preserve cognitive function. However, presently it is not clear if the common clinical measure of serum 25(OH)D serves as a robust surrogate marker for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis or function. Indeed, recent studies report CNS-biosynthesis of endogenous 25(OH)D; the CNS expression of the CYP-group of enzymes which catalyse conversion to 1,25(OH)2D3 and thereafter, deactivation. Moreover, in the periphery, there is significant ethnic/genetic heterogeneity in vit-D conversion to 1,25(OH)2D3 and there is a paucity of studies which have actually investigated vit-D kinetics across the cerebrovasculature. Compared to peripheral organs, the CNS also has differential expression of receptors that trigger cellular response to 1,25(OH)2D3 metabolites.

Early and selective loss of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) is observed in patients with sporadic behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), including FTLD with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). Recently, we further showed that these specialized neurons show preferential aggregation of TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP. Whether VENs and fork cells are prone to tau accumulation in FTLD-tau remains unclear, and no previous studies of these neurons have focused on patients with pathogenic variants in the gene encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (FTLD-tau/MAPT). Here, we examined regional profiles of tau aggregation and neurodegeneration in 40 brain regions in 8 patients with FTLD-tau/MAPT and 7 with Pick's disease (PiD), a sporadic form of FTLD-tau that often presents with bvFTD. We further qualitatively assessed the cellular patterns of frontoinsular tau aggregation in FTLD-tau/MAPT using antibodies specific for tau hyperphosphorylation, acetylation, or conformational change. ACC and mid-insula were among the regions most affected by neurodegeneration and tau aggregation in FTLD-tau/MAPT and PiD. In these two forms of FTLD-tau, severity of regional neurodegeneration and tau protein aggregation were highly correlated across regions. In FTLD-tau/MAPT, VENs and fork cells showed disproportionate tau protein aggregation in patients with V337 M, A152T, and IVS10 + 16 variants, but not in patients with the P301L variant.

It is usually expressed in immune cells and has recently been identified to distribute in the nervous system and play critical roles in various neurological disorders. Presently, the impacts of FcγRI in neuropathic pain was largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the impacts of FcγRI in neuropathic pain through pain-related neurobehavioral studies and underlying mechanisms by biochemical methods in animal and cell models. Specifically, we first utilized the chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model that displayed neuropathic pain related symptoms and signs, including thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. These neurobehavioral defects were significantly attenuated by the anti-FcγRI antibody, which was associated with reduced levels of neuropeptide substance P, C<sub>3</sub>, and TNF-α. Furthermore, we validated our animal findings using the embryonically neural crest-originated PC12 cell model. We found that stimulation of the IgG immune complex led to increased levels of FcγRI and inflammatory mediators, which were attenuated by the anti-FcγRI antibody in these cells. Collectively, our results from animal and cell-based studies suggest that FcγRI is a critical player for peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain by mediating pain-related immunological events, which therefore may provide a new therapeutic target for protection against chronic pain.</AbstractText>"}

At 22 years of age, GLK was initially cloned and identified as an upstream activator of the MAPK JNK under an environmental stress and proinflammatory cytokines. The data derived from GLK-overexpressing or shRNA-knockdown cell lines suggest that GLK may be involved in cell proliferation through mTOR signaling. GLK phosphorylates the transcription factor TFEB and retains TFEB in the cytoplasm, leading to inhibition of cell autophagy. After generating and characterizing GLK-deficient mice, the important in vivo roles of GLK in T-cell activation were revealed. In T cells, GLK directly interacts with and activates PKCθ through phosphorylating PKCθ at Ser-538 residue, leading to activation of IKK/NF-κB. Thus, GLK-deficient mice display impaired T-cell-mediated immune responses and decreased inflammatory phenotypes in autoimmune disease models. Consistently, the percentage of GLK-overexpressing T cells is increased in the peripheral blood from autoimmune disease patients; the GLK-overexpressing T cell population is correlated with disease severity of patients. The pathogenic mechanism of autoimmune disease by GLK overexpression was unraveled by characterizing T-cell-specific GLK transgenic mice and using biochemical analyses. GLK overexpression selectively promotes IL-17A transcription by inducing the AhR-RORγt complex in T cells. In addition, GLK overexpression in cancer tissues is correlated with cancer recurrence of human lung cancer and liver cancer; the predictive power of GLK overexpression for cancer recurrence is higher than that of pathologic stage. GLK directly phosphorylates and activates IQGAP1, resulting in induction of Cdc42-mediated cell migration and cancer metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of GLK inhibitor reduces disease severity of mouse autoimmune disease models and decreases IL-17A production of human autoimmune T cells. Due to the inhibitory function of HPK1/MAP4K1 in T-cell activation and the promoting effects of GLK on tumorigenesis, HPK1 and GLK dual inhibitors could be useful therapeutic drugs for cancer immunotherapy. In addition, GLK deficiency results in extension of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Taken together, targeting MAP4K3 (GLK) may be useful for treating/preventing autoimmune disease, cancer metastasis/recurrence, and aging.</AbstractText>"}

Different microscopic approaches, such as confocal analyses and high content screening, help to examine such 3D respiratory samples, resulting in high-resolution pictures and enabling quantitative analyses of high cell numbers. A major problem employing these techniques relates to single-use instead of multiple-use of Transwell filters and difficulties in the digestion of collagen if subsequent analyses are needed. Up to date, cells are seeded in collagen-based matrices to the inner field of Transwell inserts, which makes it impossible to image due to the design of the inserts and hard to perform other analyses since digestion of the collagen matrix also affects Transwell grown cells. To overcome these problems, we optimized culturing conditions for monitoring cell differentiation or repeated dose experiments over a long time period. For this, cells are seeded upside-down to the bottom side of filters within an animal-free cellulose hydrogel. These cells were then grown inverted under static conditions and were differentiated in air-liquid interphase (ALI). Full differentiation of goblet (Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial (NHBE))/Club (small airway epithelia (SAE)) cells and ciliated cells was detected after 12 days in ALI. Inverted cell cultures could then be used for 'follow-up' live cell imaging experiments, as well as, flow-cytometric analyses due to easy digestion of the cellulose compared to classical collagen matrices. Additionally, this culture technique also enables easy addition of immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, neutrophils, T or B cells alone or in combination, to the inner field of the Transwell to monitor immune cell behavior after repeated respiratory challenge. Our detailed protocol offers the possibility of culturing human primary polarized cells into a fully differentiated, thick epithelium without any animal components over &gt;700 days. Furthermore, this animal-free, inverted system allows investigation of the same inserts, because the complete Transwell can be readily transferred to glass-bottom dishes for live cell imaging analyses and then returned to its original plate for further cultivation.</AbstractText>"}

This article describes the development of an innovative, team-based model to improve the diagnosis and care of older adults with cognitive impairment in primary care practices. This model was developed through a mentoring process from a team with expertise in geriatrics and quality improvement. Refinement of the existing assessment process performed during routine care allowed patients with cognitive impairment to be identified. The practice team then used a collaborative workflow to connect patients with appropriate community resources. Utilization of these processes led to reduced referrals to the geriatrics specialty clinic, fewer patients presenting in a crisis to the social worker, and greater collaboration and self-efficacy for care of those with cognitive impairment within the practice. Although the model was initially developed to address cognitive impairment, the impact has been applied more broadly to improve the care of older adults with multimorbidity.</AbstractText>"}

Organic zinc salts seem to be good substitutes for zinc oxide as activators for sulfur vulcanization of SBR rubber, without detrimental effects to the vulcanization time and temperature. Moreover, vulcanizates containing organic zinc salts exhibit higher tensile strength and better damping properties than vulcanizate crosslinked with zinc oxide.

The pathophysiological mechanism is a complex progress involving cellular damage such as mitochondrial dysfunction and protein homeostasis. Age-mediated degenerative neurological disorders can reduce the quality of life and also impose economic burdens. Currently, the common treatment is replacement with levodopa to address low dopamine levels; however, this does not halt the progression of PD and is associated with adverse effects, including dyskinesis. In addition, elderly patients can react negatively to treatment with synthetic neuroprotection agents. Recently, natural compounds such as phytochemicals with fewer side effects have been reported as candidate treatments of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, hormesis, proteostasis, the ubiquitin‒proteasome system, and autophagy (mitophagy) to explain the neuroprotective effects of using natural products as a therapeutic strategy. We also summarize the efforts to use natural extracts to develop novel pharmacological candidates for treatment of age-related PD.</AbstractText>"}

This group is also heavily burdened with metabolic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, limited research has been conducted in this group. Understanding methylation alterations, which are influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors, is key to identifying and addressing the root cause for mild cognitive impairment, a clinical precursor for dementia. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on a community-based Mexican American population using the Illumina EPIC array. Following rigorous quality control measures, we identified 10 CpG sites to be differentially methylated between normal controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment annotated to PKIB, KLHL29, SEPT9, OR2C3, CPLX3, BCL2L2-PABPN1, and CCNY. We found four regions to be differentially methylated in TMEM232, SLC17A8, ALOX12, and SEPT8. Functional gene-set analysis identified four gene-sets, RIN3, SPEG, CTSG, and UBE2L3, as significant. The gene ontology and pathway analyses point to neuronal cell death, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammatory processes. We found 1,450 processes to be enriched using empirical Bayes gene-set enrichment. In conclusion, the functional overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans implies cross-talk between metabolically-instigated systemic inflammation and disruption of synaptic vesicular transport.</AbstractText>"}

A pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation and deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), a ∼4 kDa peptide generated through serial cleavage of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by β- and γ-secretases. Curcumin is a natural compound primarily found in the widely used culinary spice, turmeric, which displays therapeutic potential for AD. Recently, we reported the development of curcumin analogs and identified a lead compound, curcumin-like compound-R17 (CLC-R17), that significantly attenuates Aβ deposition in an AD transgenic mouse model. Here, we elucidated the mechanisms of this analog on Aβ levels and AβPP processing using cell models of AD. Using biochemical methods and our recently developed nanoplasmonic fiber tip probe technology, we showed that the lead compound potently lowers Aβ levels in conditioned media and reduces oligomeric amyloid levels in the cells. Furthermore, like curcumin, the lead compound attenuates the maturation of AβPP in the secretory pathway. Interestingly, it upregulated α-secretase processing of AβPP and inhibited β-secretase processing of AβPP by decreasing BACE1 protein levels. Collectively, our data reveal mechanisms of a promising curcumin analog in reducing Aβ levels, which strongly support its development as a potential therapeutic for AD.</AbstractText>"}

Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were genotype dependent (ɛ4/ɛ4&gt; ɛ4/ɛ3&gt; ɛ3/ɛ3&gt; ɛ2/ɛ3&gt; ɛ2/ɛ2). The greatest variation in lipids was related to the ɛ2 isoform, where various lysophosphatidylcholines and all phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) subclasses were elevated relative to ɛ3/ɛ3 and ɛ4 carriers. APOEɛ4 carriers had reduced phosphatidylinositol relative to ɛ3/ɛ3 and ɛ2 carriers. Logistic regression revealed that ɛ2 carriers were at least 4 times higher odds of being in the highest tertile of PE lipid level relative to ɛ3/ɛ3. The elevation in PE and other phospholipids in ɛ2 carriers may indicate the protective effect of ɛ2 is linked to these phospholipids. Additionally, high baseline PE in cognitively normal participants predicted protection against cognitive decline six years later.

Thirty-two healthy older adults (66.2 ± 7.3 years) performed two experimental visits that included 30-min of aerobic exercise and a rest condition on separate days. After each condition, participants performed the Flanker task during an fMRI scan. Significantly greater functional activation (incongruent &gt; congruent) was found in the left inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule after exercise compared to rest. A main effect of exercise was also observed on Flanker task performance with greater accuracy in both incongruent and congruent trials, suggesting the effects of acute exercise on Flanker performance are general across Flanker trial types. Conversely, greater executive control-related functional activations after performing a single session of exercise suggests enhanced functional processing while engaging in task conditions requiring disproportionately greater amounts of executive control.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the present study is to calculate average annual GP utilisation in 2015-16 compared with clinical demand predicted in 2005-06.<b>Methods</b>Demand was calculated from Medicare Benefits Schedule, Department of Veterans' Affairs and Australian Bureau of Statistics data. Length of consultation and average clinical hours worked per week (from 2002-03 to 2015-16) was drawn from GP self-reported data collected through the Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health (BEACH) program. GP workforce numbers were sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 'Medical practitioners workforce 2015' report.<b>Results</b>Predicted demand from 2005-06 to 2009-10 approximated GP supply. Beyond 2011, approximately 2674 additional GPs were required in 2015-16 to maintain the average annual 2005-06 GP workload. An additional 5941 GPs were required to meet the increase in clinical demand (for GP services to patients) from 2005-06 to 2015-16.<b>Conclusions</b>The number of GP clinical hours worked decreased, and clinical demand increased. Ongoing efforts are required to ensure the supply of GPs to meet the clinical demand of Australia's aging population.<b>What is known about this topic?</b>For the past three decades there has been concern about the supply of GPs in Australia. In recent years the Australian Government has taken several steps to improve access to GP services by increasing the overall supply of GPs and encouraging a more even distribution of GPs across Australia. A 2011 Australian study calculated average annual GP service utilisation and predicted the number of GPs required to meet clinical demand to 2020. There are current concerns that the GP workforce has reached a state of oversupply.<b>What does this paper add?</b>This study concludes that the GP workforce is not in a state of oversupply, confirming that patient clinical demand increased through both population growth and the aging of the population. Although the number of GPs increased, the number of clinical hours worked by (male) GPs decreased. Therefore, the rise in the number of GPs did not result in a proportional rise in GP workforce capacity. Clearly standardised definitions and inclusions for counting the GP workforce would improve accuracy in measuring this section of the health workforce.<b>What are the implications for practitioners?</b>GP workforce supply will require ongoing monitoring over coming years considering the increasing population, the aging of the population, declining clinical GP working hours and the approaching mass retirement of older GPs.</AbstractText>"}

LOH was classified as a combined primary and secondary hypogonadism since the endocrine capacity of the testes and the pituitary are impaired. Symptoms of LOH include loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of muscle mass, increased body fat, anemia, osteoporosis, depressed mood, decreased vitality, sweating, and hot flushes. Since these symptoms may also have origins other than LOH, exclusion of other disease entities and subnormal serum T levels are considered prerequisites for the diagnosis and possible treatment of LOH. However, during following years these guidelines were often neglected and, especially in the USA, indiscriminate prescribing of T was widely practised so that the US FDA warned against such irresponsible behavior. In Europe, T prescribing remained largely restricted to LOH as defined above. Nevertheless, a discussion started whether LOH really exists or is only a consequence of age-related comorbidities. Numerous studies have helped to clarify the situation, in particular, the European Male Aging Study (EMAS) and the US-initiated 7 T trials. Consequently, the newest US Endocrine Society Practice Guideline on T treatment (2018) includes advanced age as a cause of organic hypogonadism and recommends that 'in men &gt;65 years who have symptoms or conditions suggestive of T deficiency … and consistently and unequivocally low morning T concentrations we suggest that clinicians offer T therapy on an individualised basis after explicit discussion of the potential risks and benefits'.

Wheat wild relatives often produce heteromorphic seeds that differ in morphological and physiological traits. Several Aegilops and Triticum species possess, within the same spikelet, a dimorphic seed pair, with one seed being larger than the other. A comprehensive analysis is needed to understand which traits are involved in seed dimorphism and if these aspects of variation in dimorphic pairs are functionally related. To this end, dispersal units of Triticum urartu and five Aegilops species were X-rayed and the different seed morphs weighed. Germination tests were carried out on seeds, both dehulled and left in their dispersal units. Controlled ageing tests were performed to detect differences in seed longevity among seed morphs, and the antioxidant profile was assessed in terms of antioxidant compounds equipment and expression of selected antioxidant genes. We used PCA to group seed morphs sharing similar patterns of germination traits, longevity estimates and antioxidant profile. Different seed morphs differed significantly in terms of mass, final germination, germination timing, longevity estimates and antioxidant profile in most of the tested species. Small seeds germinated slower, had lower germination when left in their dispersal units, a higher antioxidant potential and were longer-lived than large seeds.

Its control has commonly been carried out through chemical methods. However, given the need to develop safer and environmentally friendly management alternatives, the pupal endoparasitoid Trichopria anastrephae Lima stands out as a potential biological control agent. However, the lack of information on the mass rearing of this parasitoid limits its use. Thus, the objective of our study was to provide information that is useful for rearing T. anastrephae using D. suzukii as a host. The effects of pupal age, exposure time, and pupal density on the parasitism rate were examined, as was the effect of honey provision for extending adult parasitoid longevity. Exposing 15 12-h-old pupae per female for 24 h resulted in higher parasitism rates and a greater number of emerged parasitoids. Males and females of T. anastrephae fed with pure honey (100%) or honey diluted to 50% in water lived longer compared to those fed 10% honey, no food, or only water.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Recommendations are formulated regarding the use of melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, gabapentin, clonidine and orexin receptor antagonists, and benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The choice of pharmacological agents and their dosage should be individualized taking into consideration multiple factors, including the severity and type of sleep problem and the associated neurological pathology.

Here, we focus on the transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that is partly responsible for limited ASD brain uptake, which is thought to contribute to ASD resistance. We previously demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the prostaglandin E receptor, prostanoid E receptor subtype 1, are involved in seizure-mediated P-gp up-regulation. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting microsomal prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE2) synthase-1 (mPGES-1), the enzyme generating PGE2, prevents blood-brain barrier P-gp up-regulation after status epilepticus (SE). To test our hypothesis, we exposed isolated brain capillaries to glutamate <i>ex vivo</i> and used a combined <i>in vivo</i>-<i>ex vivo</i> approach by isolating brain capillaries from humanized mPGES-1 mice to study P-gp levels. We demonstrate that glutamate signaling through the NMDA receptor, cytosolic phospholipase A2, COX-2, and mPGES-1 increases P-gp protein expression and transport activity levels. We show that mPGES-1 is expressed in human, rat, and mouse brain capillaries. We show that BI1029539, an mPGES-1 inhibitor, prevented up-regulation of P-gp expression and transport activity in capillaries exposed to glutamate and in capillaries from humanized mPGES-1 mice after SE.

However, key indices among all performance traits including survival, development, and fecundity of the adult insect to predict host suitability are not clear. To investigate the key performance indices, we observed the performance of an oligophagous moth Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), a pest mainly damaging rosaceous plants, on three apple varieties, three peach varieties, and three pear varieties in the laboratory by placing its eggs on fruits. The moth's fitness was evaluated by the intrinsic rate of increase at fruit variety- and species-level variability. Our results showed that the preovipositional period of female moths and longevity of male moths were the indices primarily predicting intrinsic rates of increase for fruit variety and for fruit species. However, the preovipositional period of female moths was different at species-level variability but not at variety-level variability, whereas the longevity of male moths was not different at variety- or species-level variability. These results revealed that preovipositional period of female moths was a key predictor for host suitability in G. molesta. This study highlighted that gravid females may be a principal indicator in host resource optimization for oligophagous insects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, what type of ceRNA network regulates NSCLC has not been clarified. The present study aimed to elucidate the long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA)/microRNA (miRNA)/mRNA ceRNA network in NSCLC, particularly for the significance of lncRNAs in NSCLC. NSCLC‑specific differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed and their relationship was analyzed by a ceRNA network. Their potential functions of differentially expressed mRNAs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, the expression levels of four selected lncRNAs in TCGA were determined and their associated survival of patients was examined. In addition, the expression profiles of these four lncRNAs in 48 NSCLC specimens and cell lines, their cellular distribution and associated clinical parameters were examined. We successfully constructed a ceRNA network, including 113 lncRNAs, 12 miRNAs and 36 mRNAs differentially expressed between NSCLC and non‑tumor tissues. LINC00525, MED4‑AS1, STEAP2‑AS1 and SYNPR‑AS1 lncRNAs were selected and validated for their association with the survival of NSCLC patients. The expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated in 48 NSCLC tissues and was varying in NSCLC cells. While LINC00525 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm, MED4‑AS1 was in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of A549 cells. In addition, the expression of LINC00525 was significantly associated with smoking history (P&lt;0.05); MED4‑AS1 was significantly associated with women, poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P&lt;0.05); STEAP2‑AS1 was significantly associated with women (P&lt;0.01); and SYNPR‑AS1 was significantly associated with women and adenocarcinoma (P&lt;0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects exerted by genistein on cardiomyoblasts (H9C2) against oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) release, viability, proliferation/migration and mitochondrial function. H9C2 cultured in physiological or peroxidative conditions, were treated with genistein in the absence or presence of estrogen receptors (ERs), G protein‑​coupled‑estrogenic‑receptors (GPER), Akt, extracellular‑​signal‑regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) blockers. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and oxidant/antioxidant system, were measured by specific assays. Western blot assay was used for the analysis of NO synthase (NOS) subtypes' and expression and activation of various kinases. In all experiments 17β‑estradiol was used for comparison. The results showed that phytoestrogens and estrogens can increase cell viability, proliferation/migration and improve mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption of H9C2. Furthermore, NO release was modulated by genistein and 17β‑estradiol. These effects were reduced or abolished by the pre‑treatment with ERs, GPER, Akt, ERK1/2 and p38MAPK blockers. Finally, a reduction of reactive oxygen species production and an increase of glutathione content was found in response to the two agents. In H9C2 cultured in physiological conditions, genistein induced endothelial NOS‑dependent NO production through the involvement of estrogenic receptors and by the modulation of intracellular signalling related to Akt, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK. Moreover, estrogens and phytoestrogens protected H9C2 against oxidative stress by reducing inducible NOS expression and through the modulation of the antioxidant system and mitochondrial functioning.</AbstractText>"}

One of the major causes of age-related diseases is oxidative stress. In recent years, the importance of H<sub>2</sub>S has become clear, although its antioxidant function has not yet been fully explored. The enzymes cystathionine β-synthase, cystathionine γ-lya-se, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase are involved in the enzymatic production of H<sub>2</sub>S. Previously, H<sub>2</sub>S was considered a neuromodulator, given its role in long-term hippocampal potentiation, but it is now also recognized as an antioxidant in age-related neurodegeneration. Due to aerobic metabolism, the central nervous system is vulnerable to oxidative stress in brain aging, resulting in age-associated degenerative diseases. H<sub>2</sub>S exerts its antioxidant effect by limiting free radical reactions through the activation of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, which protect against the effects of aging by regulating apoptosis-related genes, including p53, Bax, and Bcl-2. This review explores the implications and mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub>S as an antioxidant in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Down syndrome.</AbstractText>"}

Upright aquatic exercise increases mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv<sub>mean</sub> ) and has been suggested as favorable for cerebrovascular adaptations. However, MCAv<sub>mean</sub> has not been reported during swimming. Thus, we examined the cerebrovascular and cognitive effects of swimming. Ten land-based athletes (22 ± 5 years) and eight swimmers (19 ± 1 years) completed three cognitive tasks and four conditions that were used to independently and collectively delineate the swimming-related factors (i.e., posture, immersion, CO<sub>2</sub> retention [end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> ; PETCO<sub>2</sub> ], and motor involvement). Measurements of MCAv<sub>mean</sub> and PETCO<sub>2</sub> were taken throughout each condition. Prone posture increased MCAv<sub>mean</sub> by 11% (P &lt; 0.01 vs. upright land). Water immersion independently increased MCAv<sub>mean</sub> when upright (12%; P &lt; 0.01) but not prone (P = 0.76). The consequent rise in PETCO<sub>2</sub> during head-out, breast-stroke swimming (50% heart rate range) independently increased MCAv<sub>mean</sub> by 14% (P &lt; 0.01), while the motor involvement of swimming per se did not significantly change MCAv<sub>mean</sub> (P = 0.32). While accounting for sex, swimmers had ~17% lower MCAv<sub>mean</sub> during all rest conditions (P ≤ 0.05). However, in a subset of participants, both groups had similar internal carotid artery diameters (P = 0.99) and velocities (P = 0.97). Water immersion per se did not alter cognition (P ≥ 0.15), but 20 min of moderate-intensity swimming improved visuomotor performance by 4% (P = 0.03), regardless of athlete group (P = 0.12). In conclusion, breast-stroke swimming increased MCAv<sub>mean</sub> mostly due to postural and PETCO<sub>2</sub> effects, with minimal contributions from water immersion or motor activity. Lastly, swimming improved cognitive functioning acutely, regardless of athlete group. Future research should explore the chronic effects of swimming on cerebrovascular function and cognition, particularly in aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

MMA leads to an inflammatory state. The aim was to investigate the impact of MMA on bone and fat metabolism. The hypothesis was that it is possible to predict MMA by measuring ketone bodies and bone markers. Blood samples from 175 sows were taken within 72 hr after farrowing. Serum was analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)-D), serum crosslaps (CTX-I), osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), triglycerides (TG), beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and haptoglobin. Spontaneous urine was collected, and pH value was measured in addition to Ca and P. A proximate analysis of the sows' diets was performed. Age, litter size, body condition score (BCS) and clinical signs of MMA were recorded for each sow. A multivariable logistic regression was undertaken with disease status (MMA or healthy) as the dependent variable. Significance was accepted at p &lt; .05.

PubMed was searched for the last 3 years to locate cadaveric studies reporting size values, excluding histological, forensic, and osteological collections. Out of the 390 potentially relevant papers, 109 (28%) studies did not report the ages of their samples. In total, 177 studies were included for analysis comprising 4,807 subjects. The most studied structures were those of the musculoskeletal system. The mean age of the pooled sample was 71.1 ± 11.0 years. The lowest reported age was 16 while the highest was 104 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no correlation with any of the following variables: country of study, anatomical region, anatomical structure, or journal type. The mean age of cadavers used to measure the sizes of human anatomical structures falls largely within the senior age category. The reported values in an aging population will not necessarily mirror other populations such as the pediatric. The outcomes of surgeries that depend to some extent on tight morphometric values such as flap surgeries, microsurgery, tendon transfer, or mini-invasive procedures could differ when they are performed on other age categories.

In large mammals, somatic cell telomeres shorten with age, owing to the end replication problem and lack of telomere-lengthening events (e.g. telomerase and ALT activity). Therefore, telomere length reflects cellular replicative reserve and mitotic potential. Environmental insults can accelerate telomere attrition in response to cell division and DNA damage. As such, telomere shortening is considered one of the major hallmarks of ageing. Much effort has been dedicated to understanding the environmental perturbations that accelerate telomere attrition and therapeutic strategies to preserve or extend telomeres. As telomere dynamics seem to reflect cumulative cellular stress, telomere length could serve as a biomarker of animal welfare. The assessment of telomere dynamics (i.e. rate of shortening) in conjunction with telomere-regulating genes and telomerase activity in racehorses could monitor long-term animal health, yet it could also provide some unique opportunities to address particular limitations with the use of other animal models in telomere research. Considering the ongoing efforts to optimise the health and welfare of equine athletes, the purpose of this review is to discuss the potential utility of assessing telomere length in Thoroughbred racehorses. A brief review of telomere biology in large and small mammals will be provided, followed by discussion on the biological implications of telomere length and environmental (e.g. lifestyle) factors that accelerate or attenuate telomere attrition. Finally, the utility of quantifying telomere dynamics in horses will be offered with directions for future research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recent findings indicate that induced senescence in myofibroblasts can limit or reduce myocardial fibrosis, cirrhosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while also accelerating wound healing. However, more senescent cells are accumulated as organisms age, which exacerbates aging-related diseases. These two contradictory theories inspired us to summarize papers on the restrictive effect of senescence on fibrosis and to input the key findings into simple software that we developed to assist with data organization and presentation. In this review, we illustrate that senescent cells secrete more matrix metalloproteinases to solubilize excess collagen, while chemokines and cytokines activate immune cells to eliminate senescent cells. In the elderly, it is perhaps more effective to limit fibrosis by inducing myofibroblast senescence and then removing senescent cells that are not cleared via normal mechanisms by antisenescence therapies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Currently, majority of the geroprotectors are found by screening compounds in model organisms; whether they will be effective in humans is largely unknown. Here we present a new strategy called ANDRU (aging network based drug discovery) to help the discovery of human geroprotectors. It first identifies human aging subnetworks that putatively function at the interface between aging and age-related diseases; it then screens for pharmacological interventions that may 'reverse' the age-associated transcriptional changes occurred in these subnetworks. We applied ANDRU to human adipose gene expression data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. For the top 31 identified compounds, 19 of them showed at least some evidence supporting their function in improving metabolic traits or lifespan, which include type 2 diabetes drugs such as pioglitazone. As the query aging genes were refined to the ones with more intimate links to diseases, ANDRU identified more meaningful drug hits than the general approach without considering the underlying network structures. In summary, ANDRU represents a promising human data-driven strategy that may speed up the discovery of interventions to extend human healthspan.</AbstractText>"}

To ensure the long-term sustainability of these newly established systems it is essential to carefully monitor the economic impact. Based on the panel data of 21 developing countries from 2000 to 2016, this paper is the first to apply the panel threshold model to empirically analyze the relationship between national health expenditures and economic growth under different levels of human capital. The results show that health expenditure and economic growth have significant interval effects because of the different levels of human capital. Specifically, when human capital levels are low, health expenditure is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth. When human capital is at a medium level, health expenditure has a positive but not significant impact on economic growth. When the level of human capital is high, the positive economic impact of the health expenditure is significantly enhanced. In addition, subgroup analyses indicate that population aging and low fertility aggravate the negative impact of health expenditures on economic growth. This study provides reliable analysis and can be used by developing countries to maintain a long-term sustainable social security system.</AbstractText>"}

The challenge in treating older patients is to accurately identify 'fit' patients that can tolerate more intensive treatment to maximize disease control, while simultaneously identifying vulnerable or 'frail' patients who may develop toxicity with significant morbidity and mortality, requiring different treatment options or dose modification. Multiple frailty scores have been devised for multiple myeloma over the years in newly-diagnosed patients. This paper gives an overview of the three common frailty measurements: the International Myeloma Working Group Frailty Score, Mayo Clinic Frailty Score and the Revised Myeloma Co-Morbidity Index. We will summarize the derivation, validation, usability and applicability of these scores in different clinical settings, emphasizing the main strengths and limitations for each index score. We will also highlight future directions in the operationalization of frailty in multiple myeloma.</AbstractText>"}

To investigate the role of the cerebral vasculature in AD, a physiologically relevant 3D human neural cell culture microfluidic model is developed having a brain endothelial cell monolayer with a BBB-like phenotype. This model is shown to recapitulate several key aspects of BBB dysfunction observed in AD patients: increased BBB permeability, decreased expression of claudin-1, claudin-5, and VE-cadherin, increased expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 and reactive oxygen species, and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides at the vascular endothelium.

However, there are no studies reporting the expression of JMJD6 in ovarian cancer, and no JMJD6 inhibitors have been developed and applied to targeted cancer therapy research. In the present study, we found that the high expression of JMJD6 in ovarian cancer was correlated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. A potential inhibitor (SKLB325) was designed based on the crystal structure of the jmjC domain of JMJD6. This molecule significantly suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SKOV3 cell lines as detected by CCK-8 cell proliferation assays and flow cytometry. A Matrigel endothelial tube formation assay showed that SKLB325 inhibited capillary tube organization and migration in HUVECs in vitro. We also observed that JMJD6 colocalized with p53 protein in the nucleus, with mRNA and protein expression of p53 as well as its downstream effectors significantly increasing both in vitro and in intraperitoneal tumor tissues treated with SKLB325. In addition, SKLB325 significantly reduced the intraperitoneal tumor weight and markedly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that JMJD6 may be a marker of poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and that SKLB325 may be a potential candidate drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED technologies are relatively new; therefore, the long-term effects of exposure to blue light across the lifespan are not understood. We investigated the effects of light in the model organism, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and determined that flies maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12 h of blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure acts as a stressor during aging. We also determined that several known blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting in pathways mediating detrimental light effects. Our study reveals the unexpected effects of blue light on fly brain and establishes <i>Drosophila</i> as a model in which to investigate long-term effects of blue light at the cellular and organismal level.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

To evaluate this, 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15s-HpETE), a lipid peroxide, was employed to investigate its effect on PTEN using molecular and cellular-based assays. Exposure to 15s-HpETE resulted in the oxidation of recombinant PTEN. Reversible oxidation of PTEN was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells treated with a 15s-HpETE and Lipofectamine mixture.

Moreover, they support adaptive responses via Ab-dependent mechanisms, triggered by CD16, and DC editing. Their fundamental role in anti-viral responses has been unveiled in patients with NK cell deficiencies suffering from severe Herpesvirus infections. Notably, these infections, often occurring as primary infections early in life, can be efficiently cleared by NK, T, and B cells in healthy hosts. Herpesviruses however, generate a complicated balance with the host immune system through their latency cycle moving between immune control and viral reactivation. This lifelong challenge has contributed to the development of numerous evasion mechanisms by Herpesviruses, many of which devoted to elude NK cell surveillance from viral reactivations rather than primary infections. This delicate equilibrium can be altered in proportions of healthy individuals promoting virus reactivation and, more often, in immunocompromised subjects. However, the constant stimulus provided by virus-host interplay has also favored NK-cell adaptation to Herpesviruses. During anti-HCMV responses, NK cells can reshape their receptor repertoire and function, through epigenetic remodeling, and acquire adaptive traits such as longevity and clonal expansion abilities. The major mechanisms of recognition and effector responses employed by NK cells against Herpesviruses, related to their genomic organization will be addressed, including those allowing NK cells to generate memory-like responses. In addition, the mechanisms underlying virus reactivation or control will be discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Della Chiesa, De Maria, Muccio, Bozzano, Sivori and Moretta.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Furthermore, glucocorticoid treatment can lead to impaired wound healing and altered cell metabolism. Recently, we showed that exposure of zebrafish to the glucocorticoid prednisolone during fin regeneration impacts negatively on the length, bone formation, and osteoblast function of the regenerate. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of impairment, however, remain incompletely understood. In order to further elucidate the anti-regenerative effects of continued glucocorticoid exposure on fin tissues, we performed proteome profiling of fin regenerates undergoing prednisolone treatment, in addition to profiling of homeostatic fin tissue and fins undergoing undisturbed regeneration. By using LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) we identified more than 6,000 proteins across all tissue samples. In agreement with previous reports, fin amputation induces changes in chromatin structure and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition within the tissue. Notably, prednisolone treatment leads to impaired expression of selected ECM components in the fin regenerate. Moreover, the function of ion transporting ATPases and other proteins involved in macromolecule and vesicular transport mechanisms of the cell appears to be altered by prednisolone treatment. In particular, acidification of membrane-enclosed organelles such as lysosomes is inhibited. Taken together, our data indicate that continued synthetic glucocorticoid exposure in zebrafish deteriorates cellular trafficking processes in the regenerating fin, which interferes with appropriate tissue restoration upon injury.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Schmidt, Geurtzen, von Bergen, Schubert and Knopf.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although studies have previously reported subtle motor function abnormalities in early PD patients, it is unclear whether such clinical signs can be better detected while patients are concurrently performing a cognitive task, and whether they can be useful in predicting patients' clinical conversion state. Seventy-two right-handed participants (40 drug-naive patients with idiopathic unilateral PD and 32 age-matched healthy controls) were enrolled in this study. All participants were asked to perform the Purdue Pegboard test (PPT) either alone (single-task condition) or during a concurrent mental subtraction-by-3 task (dual-task condition). A 4-year telephone follow-up was later conducted to determine whether PD patients converted to bilateral signs. We found that PD patients showed a significant reduction in dexterity on the PPT compared to the controls in both single- and dual-task conditions. Yet patients' performance in the dual-task condition revealed a greater interference effect when patients performed the task with their right hand than with their left hand. PPT also revealed reasonable discriminative ability for prediagnosing PD. However, dual-tasking did not have added value in differentiating early patients and controls. At follow-up, the baseline PPT performance of the asymptomatic hands was positively correlated with time to convert from unilaterally to bilaterally affected states (<i>r</i> = 0.62, <i>P</i> = 0.031).

There is a long preclinical period followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Clinical diagnosis and the rate of decline is variable. Progression monitoring remains a challenge in AD, and it is imperative to create better tools to quantify this progression. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for patient assessment. However, current approaches for analysis require strong a priori assumptions about regions of interest used and complex preprocessing pipelines including computationally expensive non-linear registrations and iterative surface deformations. These preprocessing steps are composed of many stacked processing layers. Any error or bias in an upstream layer will be propagated throughout the pipeline. Failures or biases in the non-linear subject registration and the subjective choice of atlases of specific regions are common in medical neuroimaging analysis and may hinder the translation of many approaches to the clinical practice. Here we propose a data-driven method based on an extension of a deep learning architecture, DeepSymNet, that identifies longitudinal changes without relying on prior brain regions of interest, an atlas, or non-linear registration steps. Our approach is trained end-to-end and learns how a patient's brain structure dynamically changes between two-time points directly from the raw voxels. We compare our approach with Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines and voxel-based methods using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our model can identify AD progression with comparable results to existing Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines without the need of predefined regions of interest, non-rigid registration algorithms, or iterative surface deformation at a fraction of the processing time. When compared to other voxel-based methods which share some of the same benefits, our model showed a statistically significant performance improvement. Additionally, we show that our model can differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with MCI. The model's decision was investigated using the epsilon layer-wise propagation algorithm. We found that the predictions were driven by the pallidum, putamen, and the superior temporal gyrus. Our novel longitudinal based, deep learning approach has the potential to diagnose patients earlier and enable new computational tools to monitor neurodegeneration in clinical practice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Pena, Barman, Suescun, Jiang, Schiess, Giancardo and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We show that ASM absence in mice leads to diminished CD1d-restricted antigen presentation and iNKT cell selection in the thymus, resulting in decreased iNKT cell levels and resistance to iNKT cell-mediated inflammatory conditions. Defective antigen presentation and decreased iNKT cells are also observed in ASM-deficient humans with Niemann-Pick disease, and ASM activity in healthy humans correlates with iNKT cell phenotype. Pharmacological ASM administration facilitates antigen presentation and restores the levels of iNKT cells in ASM-deficient mice.

The former is a risk factor for the latter, but a mechanistic linkage between them remains elusive. We show that prediabetic serum hyperinsulinemia is reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid and that this chronically elevated insulin renders neurons resistant to insulin. This leads to abnormal electrophysiological activity and other defects. In addition, neuronal insulin resistance reduces hexokinase 2, thus impairing glycolysis. This hampers the ubiquitination and degradation of p35, favoring its cleavage to p25, which hyperactivates CDK5 and interferes with the GSK3β-induced degradation of β-catenin. CDK5 contributes to neuronal cell death while β-catenin enters the neuronal nucleus and re-activates the cell cycle machinery. Unable to successfully divide, the neuron instead enters a senescent-like state. These findings offer a direct connection between peripheral hyperinsulinemia, as found in prediabetes, age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

In a prospective cohort study, we longitudinally followed 530 general-population-based subjects (subsample of Czech post-MONICA study). Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured twice (at baseline and after ~8 years of follow-up) using a SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical Ltd), and the intraindividual change in PWV per year (∆PWV/year) was calculated. Concentrations of sRAGE were assessed at baseline by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems).

Consequences of replicative senescence of HTPCs were evaluated to gain partial insights into human testicular aging. To this end, early and advanced HTPC passages, in which replicative senescence was indicated by increased cell size, altered nuclear morphology, enhanced β-galactosidase activity, telomere attrition and reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), were compared. These alterations are typical for senescent cells, in general. To examine HTPC-specific changes, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) tomography was employed, which revealed a reduced mitochondrial network and an increased lysosome population. The results coincide with the data of a parallel proteomic analysis and indicate deranged proteostasis. The mRNA levels of typical contractility markers and growth factors, important for the SSC niche, were not significantly altered.

Cortical activation in response to inspiratory occlusions in high- and low-anxious individuals was found different in previous studies using the respiratory-related evoked potential method. However, specific brain areas showed different activation patterns remained unknown in these studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare cortical and subcortical neural substrates of respiratory sensation in response to inspiratory mechanical occlusion stimuli between high- and low-anxious individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In addition, associations between brain activation patterns and levels of anxiety, and breathlessness were examined. Thirty-four (17 high- and 17 low-anxious) healthy non-smoking adults with normal lung function completed questionnaires on anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory - State), and participated in a transient inspiratory occlusion fMRI experiment. The participants breathed with a customized face-mask while respiration was repeatedly interrupted by a transient inspiratory occlusion of 150-msec, delivered every 2 to 4 breaths. Breathlessness was assessed by self-report. At least 32 occluded breaths were collected for data analysis. The results showed that compared to the low-anxious group, the high-anxious individuals demonstrated significantly greater neural activations in the hippocampus, insula, and middle cingulate gyrus in response to inspiratory occlusions. Moreover, a significant relationship was found between anxiety levels and activations of the right inferior parietal gyrus, and the right precuneus. Additionally, breathlessness levels were significantly associated with activations of the bilateral thalamus, bilateral insula and bilateral cingulate gyrus. The above evidences support stronger recruitment of emotion-related cortical and subcortical brain areas in higher anxious individuals, and thus these areas play an important role in respiratory mechanosensation mediated by anxiety.</AbstractText>"}

Senescent cells present a slightly depolarized plasma membrane and higher concentrations of H+, making them more susceptible to the action of CGs. These vulnerabilities can be exploited for therapeutic purposes as evidenced by the in vivo eradication of tumors xenografted in mice after treatment with the combination of a senogenic and a senolytic drug.

The similarities between this process and evolution by natural selection have led many groups to use phylogenetic methods to characterize the development of immunological memory, vaccination, and other processes that depend on affinity maturation. However, these applications are limited by the fact that most phylogenetic models are designed to be applied to individual lineages comprising genetically diverse sequences, while B cell repertoires often consist of hundreds to thousands of separate low-diversity lineages. Further, several features of affinity maturation violate important assumptions in standard phylogenetic models. Here, we introduce a hierarchical phylogenetic framework that integrates information from all lineages in a repertoire to more precisely estimate model parameters while simultaneously incorporating the unique features of SHM. We demonstrate the power of this repertoire-wide approach by characterizing previously undescribed phenomena in affinity maturation. First, we find evidence consistent with age-related changes in SHM hot-spot targeting. Second, we identify a consistent relationship between increased tree length and signs of increased negative selection, apparent in the repertoires of recently vaccinated subjects and those without any known recent infections or vaccinations. This suggests that B cell lineages shift toward negative selection over time as a general feature of affinity maturation. Our study provides a framework for undertaking repertoire-wide phylogenetic testing of SHM hypotheses and provides a means of characterizing dynamics of mutation and selection during affinity maturation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Often referred to as the G0 state, quiescence is, however, not a uniform state but with graded depth. Shallow quiescent cells exhibit a higher tendency to revert to proliferation than deep quiescent cells, while deep quiescent cells are still fully reversible under physiological conditions, distinct from senescent cells. Cellular mechanisms underlying the control of quiescence depth and the connection between quiescence and senescence are poorly characterized, representing a missing link in our understanding of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here we measured transcriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from shallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth signals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly up-regulated in deep quiescence, and partially compensated for gradually reduced autophagy flux. Reducing lysosomal function drove cells progressively deeper into quiescence and eventually into a senescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal function, by lowering oxidative stress, progressively pushed cells into shallower quiescence. That is, lysosomal function modulates graded quiescence depth between proliferation and senescence as a dimmer switch. Finally, we found that a gene-expression signature developed by comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can correctly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that while quiescence is generally considered to protect cells from irreversible arrest of senescence, quiescence deepening likely represents a common transition path from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we trained monkeys to perform a decision-making task where they made binary choices between reward-predictive stimuli which were well-learned ('overtrained'), recently learned ('novel'), or a combination of both ('mixed'). Subjects were free to saccade around the screen and make a choice (via joystick response) at any time. Subjects rarely fixated both options, yet choice behavior was better explained by assuming the values of both stimuli governed choices. The first fixation latency was fast (∼150 ms) but, surprisingly, its direction was value-driven. This suggests covert evaluation of stimulus values prior to first saccade. This was particularly evident for overtrained stimuli. For novel stimuli, first fixations became increasingly value-driven throughout a behavioral session. However, this improvement lagged behind learning of accurate economic choices, suggesting separate processes governed their learning. Finally, mixed trials revealed a strong bias toward fixating the novel stimulus first but no bias toward choosing it. Our results suggest that the primate brain contains fast covert evaluation mechanisms for guiding fixations toward highly valuable and novel information. By employing such covert mechanisms, fixation behavior becomes dissociable from the value comparison processes that drive final choice. This implies that primates use separable decision systems for value-guided fixations and value-guided choice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

In France, nearly three million people are concerned, half of whom are undiagnosed, 85,000 people are on dialysis or waiting for a kidney transplant. Each year, 11,000 new diagnoses of severe renal failure are made, one third of which had not been treated before. Kidney failure is constantly increasing due to the aging of the population and the resurgence of chronic diseases, including obesity and cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes, two conditions that impair renal function. The pharmacist, a local actor, is well placed to help patients adhere to their treatment and manage it to the best of their quality of life. It is up to the pharmacist to check the dosages according to the degree of renal involvement, ideally noted on the prescription or, failing that, by asking the patient the results of his recent biological examinations. The consultation of the pharmaceutical file and, ultimately, the shared medical file, will make it possible, in a concerted management of the patient's care pathway, to also detect possible drug interactions. By dispensing the prescribed drugs, the pharmacist can also warn against those known to be known for their nephrotoxicity, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the case of over-the-counter products, the pharmacist may discourage a person at risk from taking certain drugs containing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin and ibuprofen. Because of their potential renal toxicity, the pharmacist is competent to alert, especially on certain food supplements, herbal products, and is legitimate to participate in screening campaigns.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Société francophone de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation.

The consequences of sensory perception are not simply limited to decision-making behaviors; evidence suggests that sensory perception directly influences physiology and aging, a phenomenon that has been observed in animals across taxa. Therefore, understanding the neural mechanisms by which sensory input influences aging may uncover novel therapeutic targets for aging-related physiologies. In this review, we examine different perceptive experiences that have been most clearly linked to aging or age-related disease: food perception, social perception, time perception, and threat perception. For each, the sensory cues, receptors, and/or pathways that influence aging as well as the individual or groups of neurons involved, if known, are discussed.

Nearly 90% of HGPS cases carry the G608G mutation within exon 11 that generates a truncated prelamin A protein 'progerin'. Progerin accumulates in HGPS cells and induces premature senescence at the cellular and organismal levels. Children suffering from HGPS develop numerous clinical features that overlap with normal aging, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, hair loss and lipodystrophy. To determine whether an aberrant signaling pathway might underlie the development of these four diseases (atherosclerosis, arthritis, hair loss and lipodystrophy), we performed a text mining analysis of scientific literature and databases. We found a total of 17 genes associated with all four pathologies, 14 of which were linked to the JAK1/2-STAT1/3 signaling pathway. We report that the inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway with baricitinib, a Food and Drug Administration-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor, restored cellular homeostasis, delayed senescence and decreased proinflammatory markers in HGPS cells. Our ex vivo data using human cell models indicate that the overactivation of JAK-STAT signaling mediates premature senescence and that the inhibition of this pathway could show promise for the treatment of HGPS and age-related pathologies.</AbstractText>"}

Common elements in UGS such as the type of vegetation and the type of surface are surprisingly understudied in regard to their relationship with the type of activity undertaken in UGS. This paper aims to explore the relationship between landscape diversity and the type of surface with the time spent and the physical activity intensity performed by seniors. To do so, this study uses GPS tracking data in combination with accelerometer data gathered from 63 seniors residing in Barcelona, Spain. Results showed that senior participants spent little time inside the analyzed UGS and sedentary behaviors (SBs) were more common than physical activities (PAs). The presence of pavement surfaces positively influenced the total time spent in UGS while gravel surfaces were negatively associated with time spent in active behaviors. The provision of well-defined and maintained paved areas and paths are some key infrastructures to be considered when designing UGS for overall urban residents and, especially, when aiming to potentiate the access for senior visitors.</AbstractText>"}

In our previous work on the PHysical Assistant RObot System (PHAROS), we developed a system that proposed and monitored physical activities. The system used a social robot to analyse, by means of computer vision, the exercise a person was doing. Then, a recommender system analysed the exercise performed and indicated what exercise to perform next. However, the system needed certain improvements. On the one hand, the vision system captured the movement of the person and indicated whether the exercise had been done correctly or not. On the other hand, the recommender system was based purely on a ranking system that did not take into account temporal evolution and preferences. In this work, we propose an evolution of PHAROS, PHAROS 2.0, incorporating improvements in both of the previously mentioned aspects. In the motion capture aspect, we are now able to indicate the degree of completeness of each exercise, identifying the part that has not been done correctly, and a real-time performance correction. In this way, the recommender system receives a greater amount of information and so can more accurately indicate the exercise to be performed. In terms of the recommender system, an algorithm was developed to weigh the performance, temporal evolution and preferences, providing a more accurate recommendation, as well as expanding the recommendation to a batch of exercises, instead of just one.</AbstractText>"}

The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of SCFA but not gut microbiota richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to SCFA production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</AbstractText>"}

The wheat-lentil bread had 30% more proteins than wheat bread (8.3%, as is), a more balanced amino acids composition, an almost double mineral (0.63%, as is) as well as total dietary fibre content (4.6%, as is), double the amount of polyphenols (939.1 mg GAE/100g on dry matter, d.m.), higher amounts and variety of lignans, and more than double the antioxidant capacity (71.6 µmoL/g d.m.). The in vivo effect of 60 days bread consumption on the immune response was studied by means of a murine model of elderly mice. Serum cytokines and intraepithelial lymphocyte immunophenotype from the mice intestine were analysed as markers of systemic and intestinal inflammatory status, respectively. Analysis of immune parameters in intraepithelial lymphocytes showed significant differences among the two types of bread indicating a positive effect of the wheat-lentil bread on the intestinal immune system, whereas both breads induced a reduction in serum IL-10.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, degradation of polyethersulfone (PES) membrane due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure under alkaline condition (pH 9 and 11) was holistically investigated by humic acid (HA) filtration experiments and multiple membrane characterization techniques, with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) aging examined as a comparison.

Meanwhile, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> aging slightly increased fouling propensity with HA filtration, while NaClO aging resulted in more serious fouling. ATR-FTIR and XPS analysis revealed much less degradation of PES and hydrophilic additive by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than that by NaClO, and membrane morphology and surface properties were characterized to explain the variation of filtration performance. Overall, compared with cleaning with NaClO, membrane degradation can be minimized by cleaning with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, it also emphasizes a plant-based dietary pattern consistent with an environmentally sustainable healthy reference diet conveyed by the EAT-Lancet Commission report. Nevertheless, the MedDiet does not exclude, but rather moderates consumption of animal-based foods, and therefore has emerged as a dietary pattern that could address both health and environmental concerns. However, whether non-Mediterranean countries such as Australia can adhere to such dietary principles is less clear. In this narrative review, we present evidence from eight randomized control trials conducted in Australia which demonstrates impressive and sustained adherence to a MedDiet intervention. However, we also report heterogeneity in the dietary protocols and prescriptive interpretation of a MedDiet across all studies presented in this review, making interpretations of the efficacy and adherence challenging. Based on the observable health benefits, translating key dietary elements of a Mediterranean-style diet within the Australian population remains attractive. However, adapting or modernizing traditional dietary patterns to satisfy the population's nutritional requirements and/or acceptability warrants further exploration.</AbstractText>"}

We recruited a total of 480 subjects, 240 patients with fatigue and 240 controls without fatigue, from the Cannizzaro Hospital of Catania (Italy). Fatigue severity was measured by the fatigue severity scale, whereas mental and physical fatigue were measured through the Wessely and Powell fatigue scale, respectively. We also measured several blood parameters and 25-OH vitamin D. Subjects with fatigue showed lower levels of vitamin D as compared with those without fatigue. Blood levels of parameters related to fatigue were normal in both groups of subjects, however, platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), mean corpuscular volume, C-reactive protein (CRP), iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the fatigue group with respect to the control group.

Following this, it compares health inequalities among the elderly in different age groups, and finally, uses the Shapley and recentered influence function-index-ordinary least squares (RIF-I-OLS) model to decompose the effect of four factors on health inequality among the elderly in rural China. The QWB score distribution shows that the health of the elderly in rural China improved with social economic development and medical reform from 2002 to 2014. However, at the same time, we were surprised to find that the health level of the 65-74 years old group has been declining steadily since 2008. This phenomenon implies that the incidence of chronic diseases is moving towards the younger elderly. The WI and EI show that there is indeed pro-rich health inequality among the rural elderly, the health inequality of the younger age groups is more serious than that of the older age groups, and the former incidence of health inequality is higher. Health inequality in the age group of 65-74 years old is higher than that in other groups, and the trend of change fluctuated downward from 2002 to 2014. Health inequality in the age group of 75-84 years old is lower than that in the group of 65-74 years old, but higher than that in the other age groups. The results of Shapley decomposition show that demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), health care access, and quality of later life contributed 0.0054, 0.0130, 0.0442, and 0.0218 to the health inequality index of the elderly, which accounted for 6.40%, 15.39%, 52.41%, and 25.80% of health inequality index. From the results of RIF-I-OLS decomposition, this paper has analyzed detailed factors' marginal effects on health inequality from four dimensions, which indicates that the health inequality among the elderly in rural China was mainly caused by the disparity of income, medical expenses, and living arrangement.</AbstractText>"}

Crude fat and ash content were significantly higher in the Pakistani than in the Baladi Saudi and Somali breeds, except for higher moisture content observed in the Somali breed. The longissimus lumborum (LL) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles had a greater crude protein than the biceps femoris (BF) muscle. Storage period exhibited a significant reduction in pH values and improvement in color components of meat. The Somali breed produced higher cooking loss % and shear force, with a lower water holding capacity than the Baladi Saudi and Pakistani breeds. The LL muscle had better cooking loss %, water holding capacity, and shear force, whereas storage period (7 days) exhibited a significant reduction in the myofibrillar fragmentation index. Baladi Saudi and Pakistani breeds and LL muscle samples presented better meat sensory attributes, while storage period had no significant influence on the overall sensory characters of meat. In conclusion, there were significant differences between the chemical and structural characteristics of the LL, BF, and SM muscle samples among the three breeds of camel. Baladi Saudi and Pakistani had better meat quality traits than the Somali breed. In addition, LL muscles had better nutritional values and meat quality parameters than BF and SM muscles. Improvement in meat quality attributes were achieved with the storage process of 7 days. It is observed that, the Saudi Baladi camels have a merit of low fat content over both Somali and Pakistani camel breeds. It is also concluded that no significant effects were observed between the treatments as a result of storage when sensory attributes were considered. Moreover, breed, muscle and storage period were interacted significantly only with regard to lightness color space and shear force. This is useful knowledge for the meat industry for optimizing processing and storage procedures for various camel muscles.</AbstractText>"}

Classically, atherosclerosis has been explained as a simple arterial lipid deposition with concomitant loss of vascular elasticity. Eventually, this condition can lead to consequent blood flow reduction through the affected vessel. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that more factors than lipid accumulation are involved in arterial damage at the cellular level, such as inflammation, autophagy impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, and/or free-radical overproduction. In order to consider the correction of all of these pathological changes, new approaches in atherosclerosis treatment are necessary. Ubiquinone or coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> is a multifunctional molecule that could theoretically revert most of the cellular alterations found in atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol biosynthesis dysregulation, impaired autophagy flux and mitochondrial dysfunction thanks to its redox and signaling properties. In this review, we will show the latest advances in the knowledge of the relationships between coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> and atherosclerosis. In addition, as atherosclerosis phenotype is closely related to aging, it is reasonable to believe that coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> supplementation could be beneficial for both conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Time out of home (TOH) and number of activity locations (#ALs) are two indicators that are often derived from GPS data, despite lacking consensus regarding thresholds to be used to extract those as well as limited knowledge about their validity. Using 7 days of GPS and diary data of 35 older adults, we make the following three main contributions. First, we perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate how using spatial and temporal thresholds to compute TOH and #ALs affects the agreement between self-reported and GPS-based indicators. Second, we show how daily self-reported and GPS-derived mobility indicators are compared. Third, we explore whether the type and duration of self-reported activity events are related to the degree of correspondence between reported and GPS event. Highest indicator agreement was found for temporal interpolation (<i>Tmax</i>) of up to 5 h for both indicators, a radius (<i>Dmax</i>) to delineate home between 100 and 200 m for TOH, and for #ALs a spatial extent (<i>Dmax</i>) between 125 and 200 m, and temporal extent (<i>Tmin</i>) between 5 and 6 min to define an activity location. High agreement between self-reported and GPS-based indicators is obtained for TOH and moderate agreement for #ALs. While reported event type and duration impact on whether a reported event has a matching GPS event, indoor and outdoor events are detected at equal proportions. This work will help future studies to choose optimal threshold settings and will provide knowledge about the validity of mobility indicators.</AbstractText>"}

Ex hypothesi, we predict a priori that controlled psilocybin interventions exert quantifiable positive impact on leucocyte telomere length (telomeres are a robust predictor of mortality and multifarious aging-related diseases). Our hypothesising follows the Popperian logic of scientific discovery, viz., bold (and refutable) conjectures form the very foundation of scientific progress. The 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' is formalised as a logically valid deductive (syllogistic) argument and we provide substantial evidence to support the underlying premises. Impetus for our theorising derives from a plurality of converging empirical sources indicating that psilocybin has persistent beneficial effects on various aspects of mental health (e.g., in the context of depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, addiction, etc.). Additional support is based on a large corpus of studies that establish reliable correlations between mental health and telomere attrition (improved mental health is generally correlated with longer telomeres). Another pertinent component of our argument is based on recent studies which demonstrate that 'meditative states of consciousness' provide beneficial effects on genetic aging. Similarly, psilocybin can induce states of consciousness that are neurophysiologically and phenomenologically significantly congruent with meditative states. Furthermore, prior research has demonstrated that a single dose of psilocybin can occasion life-changing transformative experiences (≈ 70% of healthy volunteers rate their experience with psilocybin amongst the five personally most meaningful lifetime events, viz., ranked next to giving birth to a child or losing a loved one). We postulate that these profound psychological events leave quantifiable marks at the molecular genetic/epigenetic level. Given the ubiquitous availability and cost effectiveness of telomere length assays, we suggest that quantitative telomere analysis should be regularly included in future psilocybin studies as an adjunctive biological marker (i.e., to facilitate scientific consilience via methodological triangulation). In order to substantiate the 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' potential neuropsychopharmacological, endocrinological, and genetic mechanisms of action are discussed (e.g., HPA-axis reactivity, hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotropic growth factors such as BDNF, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonism, neuroplasticity/synaptoplasticity, brain-wide alterations in neuronal functional connectivity density, involvement of the SLC6A4 serotonin transporter gene, inter alia). The proposed research agenda is thus intrinsically highly interdisciplinary, and it has deep ramifications from a philosophy of science perspective as it connects the epistemic level (qualitative experiential phenomenology) with the ontic level (quantitative molecular genetics) of analysis. In the long term, multidisciplinary and innovative investigations of the 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' could contribute to the improvement of senotherapeutic psychological interventions and the identification of novel geroprotective and neuroprotective/restorative pharmaceutical targets to decelerate genetic aging and improve well-being and quality of life during the aging process.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin producing beta cells in pancreatic islets. Islet transplantation is a treatment for certain individuals with T1D. Islet transplantation in rodents, as an experimental model of the clinical scenario, requires consistency of islet quantity and quality to obtain reproducible results. In this study, we investigated the yield and function of the isolated islets from rats of different ages. Pancreata were harvested from young (10-20 week-old), intermediate (21-40 week-old) and old (&gt;41 week-old) male rats and islets were isolated using a standard protocol. Islet number, morphometry, viability, function, and metabolism were characterized. Islet yield, normalized to body weight, decreased as a function of increasing donor age. Islets from pancreata from young animals were larger and less fragmented compared to islets from organs from intermediate and older animals. Islet viability following overnight culture was the same for islets derived from young and intermediate aged donors but less for islets from old donors. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was decreased in islets from older donors. Islet metabolism following glucose challenge, as measured by oxygen consumption, revealed that islets from old donors were metabolically slower and lagged in response to glucose-stimuli. These data demonstrate that increasing donor age has a negative impact on isolated islet yield and quality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Over the last 15 years, data have begun to emerge from human and more frequently, mouse studies, that support the idea that parasitic worm infection can protect against this condition. We have therefore investigated the potential of two synthetic small molecule analogues (SMAs) of the anti-inflammatory Acanthocheilonema viteae product ES-62, to protect against metabolic dysfunction in a C57BL/6 J mouse model of high calorie diet-induced obesity. We found weekly subcutaneous administration of the SMAs in combination (1 μg of each), starting one week before continuous exposure to high calorie diet (HCD), decreased fasting glucose levels and reversed the impaired glucose clearance observed in male mice, when measured at approximately 7 and 13 weeks after exposure to HCD. Fasting glucose levels were also-reduced in male mice fed a HCD for some 38 weeks when given SMA-treatment 13 weeks after the start of HCD, indicating an SMA-therapeutic potential. For the most part, protective effects were not observed in female mice. SMA treatment also conferred protection against each of reduced ileum villus length and liver fibrosis, but more prominently in female mice. Previous studies in mice indicate that protection against metabolic dysfunction is usually associated with polarisation of the immune system towards a type-2/anti-inflammatory direction but our attempts to correlate improved metabolic parameters with such changes were unsuccessful. Further analysis will therefore be required to define mechanism of action. Nevertheless, overall our data clearly show the potential of the drug-like SMAs as a preventative or treatment for metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Skin aging is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, aging skin tissue is known to create a permissive tissue microenvironment that promotes the initiation, progression and resistance of cancer cells by promoting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Therefore, more attention should be paid to skin aging. In this review, we highlight the common Rel proteins and two activation pathways: the canonical activation pathway and the non-canonical activation pathway. Furthermore, we summarize the role of NF-κB in skin aging. The effects of UV on the skin results from the production of ROS. Excessive free radicals activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, contributing to the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB. Then it increased the level of TNF-α and the expression of MMPs, which induce the degradation of ECM and accelerated skin aging. We also summarize some reported natural antioxidants and synthetic antioxidants which are related to NF-κB signals. On the other hand, NF-κB plays a key role in SASP. Upon senescence-inducing signals, ATM and ATR block p62-dependent autophagic degradation of GATA4, contributing to NF-κB activation and SASP induction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished H<sub>2</sub>S production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic acid. Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This secondary data analysis of research from a community-based study of sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults sought to explore the unique needs of this growing 'out' population and identify the future program, policy, and research goals. The sampling population for this study was drawn from a community-based study conducted initially by researchers from the ACRIA center. The SGM veterans in this pilot study were recruited from the Center on Halstead, the largest SGM community-based center in the Midwest. Twenty-six veterans' self-identified as gay men. Considering the minority stress model, data from this study identified a group of men with less social support - either formal or informal, less housing and economic security, and low service utilization. Interestingly, this group also self-reported as having a more positive mental and physical health outlook than previous research with this population. This study also identified a clear need for education, more extensive population-based mixed methods studies to help understand fully the needs of this previously 'invisible' population of older military veterans.</AbstractText>"}

However, its further progress is impeded by unsatisfactory cyclic behaviors due to still 'ill-defined' phase changes. To gain insights into the pyrite working principles/failure factors, we herein design a core-shell hybrid of a FeS<sub>2</sub>@carbon nanoreactor, an optimal anode configuration approaching the practical usage state. The resultant electrodes exhibit a <i>Max</i>. specific capacity of ∼272.89 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> (at ∼0.81 A g<sup>-1</sup>), remarkably improved cyclic longevity/stability (beyond ∼80% capacity retention after 10<sup>3</sup> cycles) and superior rate capability (∼146.18 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> is remained at ∼20.01 A g<sup>-1</sup>) in contrast to bare FeS<sub>2</sub> counterparts. The as-built Ni-Fe full cells can also output impressive specific energy/power densities of ∼87.38 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>/ ∼ 11.54 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, a refreshed redox reaction working mechanism of 'FeS<sub>2</sub>OH ↔FeS<sub>2</sub>↔Fe<sup>0</sup><sub>(in pyrite domains)</sub>' is redefined based on real-time electrode characterizations at distinct operation stages. In a total cyclic period, the configured pyrite-based anodes would stepwise undergo three critical stages nominally named 'retention', 'phase transition/coexistence', and 'degradation', each of which is closely related to variations on anodic compositions/structures. Combined with optimal electrode configurations and in-depth clarifications on inherent phase conversions, this focus study may guide us to maximize the utilization efficiency of pyrite for all other aqueous electrochemical devices.</AbstractText>"}

However, the role of melanocytes in the process is understudied. Our data show that melanocytes are the only epidermal cell type to express the senescence marker p16<sup>INK4A</sup> during human skin ageing. Aged melanocytes also display additional markers of senescence such as reduced HMGB1 and dysfunctional telomeres, without detectable telomere shortening. Additionally, senescent melanocyte SASP induces telomere dysfunction in paracrine manner and limits proliferation of surrounding cells via activation of CXCR3-dependent mitochondrial ROS. Finally, senescent melanocytes impair basal keratinocyte proliferation and contribute to epidermal atrophy in vitro using 3D human epidermal equivalents. Crucially, clearance of senescent melanocytes using the senolytic drug ABT737 or treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ suppressed this effect. In conclusion, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent melanocytes affect keratinocyte function and act as drivers of human skin ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This method is reliable and valid and has been utilized in several studies. SctO2 is lower during both rest and peak exercise in patients with HF than in healthy controls (66.3 ± 13.3% and 63.4 ± 13.8% vs. 73.1 ± 2.8% and 72 ± 3.2%). SctO2 at rest is significantly linearly correlated with peak VO2 (r = 0.602), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (r = 0.501), and brain natriuretic peptide (r = -0.492), all of which are recognized prognostic and disease severity markers, indicating its potential prognostic value. SctO2 is determined mainly by end-tidal CO2 pressure, mean arterial pressure, and hemoglobin in the HF population.

The use of flexible polymer electrode arrays can support long-lasting recording, but the same mechanical properties that allow for longevity of recording make multiple insertions and integration into a chronic implant a challenge. Here is a methodology by which multiple polymer electrode arrays can be targeted to a relatively spatially unconstrained set of brain areas. The method utilizes thin-film polymer devices, selected for their biocompatibility and capability to achieve long-term and stable electrophysiologic recording interfaces. The resultant implant allows accurate and flexible targeting of anatomically distant regions, physical stability for months, and robustness to electrical noise. The methodology supports up to sixteen serially inserted devices across eight different anatomic targets. As previously demonstrated, the methodology is capable of recording from 1024 channels. Of these, the 512 channels in this demonstration used for single neuron recording yielded 375 single units distributed across six recording sites. Importantly, this method also can record single units for at least 160 days. This implantation strategy, including temporarily bracing each device with a retractable silicon insertion shuttle, involves tethering of devices at their target depths to a skull-adhered plastic base piece that is custom-designed for each set of recording targets, and stabilization/protection of the devices within a silicone-filled, custom-designed plastic case. Also covered is the preparation of devices for implantation, and design principles that should guide adaptation to different combinations of brain areas or array designs.</AbstractText>"}

Consequently, the placement of titanium implants has changed the paradigms of restorative dentistry. Implants are used to prevent placing reconstructions anchored on natural teeth when these are vital and intact. Furthermore, implants are suitable to improve subjective chewing function and to replace missing and strategically important abutments. The osseointegration process is characterized by a predictable sequence of healing events that encompass the formation of woven bone, parallel fibers, and lamellar bone and result in fully functional bone that will remodel throughout life. While the osseointegration facilitates the use of implants as prosthetic abutments, it has to be kept in mind that the peri-implant soft tissue may be subject to biological complications. This, in turn, may result in an infectious process that will jeopardize the osseointegration. Consequently, the monitoring of the peri-implant tissues is an important aspect, and early intervention in situations with peri-implant mucositis is mandatory for the prevention of peri-implantitis. Hence, it is evident that oral implants need lifelong maintenance care if their longevity is to be assured.</AbstractText>"}

However, incomplete reprogramming is a major barrier to SCNT, and the assessment of reprogramming is limited to preimplantation embryos and tissues from dead and/or adult tissue. Thus, lifelong monitoring in SCNT dogs can be useful to evaluate the SCNT service dogs for propagation. We applied microarray and qRT-PCR to profile of mRNA and miRNA in whole blood samples collected from four cloned dogs (S), three age-matched control dogs (A), and a donor dog (D). In the analysis of differentially expressed genes in S-A, A-D, and S-D pairs, most genomes were completely reprogrammed and rejuvenated in the cloned offspring. However, several RNAs were differentially expressed. Interestingly, the altered genes are associated with aging and senescence. Furthermore, we identified potential biomarkers such as mirR-223 (<i>NFIB</i>; <i>CLIC4</i>), miRN-494 (<i>ARHGEF12</i>), miR-106b (<i>PPP1R3B</i>; <i>CC2D1A</i>), miR-20a (<i>CC2D1A</i>; <i>PPP1R3B</i>), miR-30e (<i>IGJ</i>; <i>HIRA</i>), and miR-19a (<i>TNRC6A</i>) by miRNA-target mRNA pairing for monitoring rejuvenation, aging/senescence, and reprogramming in cloned dogs. The novel comparative transcriptomic information about SCNT and age-matched dogs can be used to assess the lifelong health of cloned dogs and to facilitate the selection of training animals with minimal invasive procedures.</AbstractText>"}

In the past decade, several ignored factors including personalized and disease-specific protein corona (a layer of formed biomolecules at the surface of nanoparticles upon their entrance into a biological fluid), incubating temperature, local temperature gradient, cell shape, and cell sex has been introduced. Here, it was hypothesized and validated cell age as another overlooked factor in the field of nanomedicine. To test our hypothesis, cellular toxicity and uptake profiles of our model nanoparticles (i.e., PEGylated quantum dots, QDs) were probed in young and senescent cells (i.e., IMR90 fibroblast cells from human fetal lung and CCD841CoN epithelial cells from human fetal colon) and the outcomes revealed substantial dependency of cell-nanoparticles interactions to the cell age. For example, it was observed that the PEGylated QDs were acutely toxic to senescent IMR90 and CCD841CoN cells, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization which caused cell necrosis; in contrast, the young cells were resilient to the exact same amount of QDs and the same incubation time. It was also found that the formation of protein corona could delay the QDs' toxicity on senescent cells. These findings suggest that the cellular aging process have a capacity to cause deteriorative effects on their organelles and normal functions. The outcomes of this study suggest the proof-of-concept that cell age may have critical role in biosystem responses to nanoparticle technologies. Therefore, the effect of cell age should be carefully considered on the nanobio interactions and the information about cellular age (e.g., passage number and age of the cell donor) should be included in the nanomedicine papers to facilitate clinical translation of nanotechnologies and to help scientists to better design and produce safe and efficient diagnostic/therapeutic age-specific nanoparticles.</AbstractText>"}

Flies were raised on different dose of sucrose and fixed concentration of protein containing media and separated according to their gender and age. Redox status biomarkers such as protein carbonyl groups, dityrosine, kynurenine, lipid hydroperoxides, advanced glycation end products, and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase were assessed. We found that all of the males had higher levels of basal oxidative stress biomarkers except protein carbonyl. On the other hand, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity was elevated. We found that high concentration of sucrose leads to impaired redox status. We also observed that high protein content in sucrose-based media fecundity rate was increased and also transition to adult flies and survival ratio were decreased. Further studies are needed to focus on evaluation of the relation between median life span, nutritional mechanisms, and redox status biomarkers. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Aging is characterized by functional decline in whole body system. Unfortunately, many of the life span extension strategies may lead to age-related disorders. It is widely accepted that impaired redox homeostasis is one of the signs of age-related pathophysiological changes. Due to difficulties in the establishment and validation of mimetic aging models in rodents, D. melanogaster is becoming/getting widely used model organism in gerontological studies. Currently, high protein and low carbohydrate-based nutrition regimes have become one of the most popular nutritional choice in aging population. Favorable nutrition type is considered one of the important factors for preventing age-related pathologies and promote healthy aging. In this study, we aimed to evaluate redox modulatory effects of different nutrition types as combination of various sucrose and constant protein concentration on basal redox status in D. melanogaster. Due to evolutionally conservation, we hypothesize that similar findings may be observed in aging population. Favorable nutrition type may ameliorate or postpone age-related degenerative processes and promote healthy aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Women had at least four consecutive nights of actigraphy (95% with 7 nights) and sleep diaries, and self-reported sleep complaints measured at each time point. Partial correlations adjusted for time between assessments across the 12 years were significant and moderate in size (rs = .33-.58). PROC MIXED/GLIMMIX multivariate models showed that sleep duration increased over time; wake after sleep onset (WASO) declined, midpoint of sleep interval increased, and sleep latency and number of sleep complaints did not change between the first and third assessments. Blacks and Whites increased in sleep duration more than Chinese. Taken together, the results of this longitudinal study suggest that sleep may not worsen in general in midlife women.

The accumulation of protein aggregates has been associated with aging and other pathologies in eukaryotes, and in bacteria with changes in growth rate, stress resistance and virulence. Numerous past studies, mostly performed in Escherichia coli, have led to a detailed understanding of the functions of the bacterial protein quality control machinery in preventing and reversing protein aggregation. However, more recent research points towards unexpected diversity in how phylogenetically different bacteria utilize components of this machinery to cope with protein aggregation. Furthermore, how persistent protein aggregates localize and are passed on to progeny during cell division and how their presence impacts reproduction and the fitness of bacterial populations remains a controversial field of research. Finally, although protein aggregation is generally seen as a symptom of stress, recent work suggests that aggregation of specific proteins under certain conditions can regulate gene expression and cellular resource allocation.

Eight male astronauts (44 ± 7 years of age (mean ± SD); mean mission length: 167 ± 12 days) participated in a standardized supine-to-sit-to-stand test (5 min-30s-3 min) pre- and postflight, and a 3 min thigh cuff occlusion test pre- and inflight with continuous monitoring of heart rate and arterial blood pressure. The arterial baroreflex was not changed inflight as shown by similar reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) response to leg cuff deflation (preflight -19 ± 2 mmHg vs. inflight -18 ± 5 mmHg). With the sit/stand test, the nadir of MAP was lower postflight (-17 ± 9 mmHg) than preflight (-11 ± 6 mmHg, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

Inflight testing was influenced by elevated cardiac output resulting in a smaller drop in total peripheral resistance. Two of eight subjects exhibited orthostatic hypotension during the postflight stand test; their responses were not predicted by the inflight leg cuff deflation test.

The main pathophysiological hallmark of COPD is expiratory flow limitation which impairs the ability of respiratory system to adequately and properly ventilate. To be able to prognosticate and manage patients with COPD, various societies have developed classifications of disease severity. Current classification schemes combine three elements that include lung function, patient reported symptoms (shortness of breath) and frequency of exacerbations. Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), an international guideline for diagnosis and management of COPD, started using this approach since the 2011 revision. Management according to this scheme has been developed and is in use. Comprehensive COPD management is multifaceted. It includes pharmacologic management, patient education, smoking cessation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, depression and anxiety management, pulmonary rehabilitation, and if indicated, home oxygen therapy.

However, a comprehensive description of known independent contributors to, and risk associates of, frailty in these patients remain unavailable. In the present review, original studies up to 28 February 2019 that assessed frailty in patients with all stages of CKD were retrieved and reviewed, with results extracted and summarized. By pooling 62 original investigations, 58.1% and 49.1% used cohort and cross-sectional designs, respectively. Dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease patients (<i>n</i> = 39; 62.9%) were the most commonly examined population, followed by those with nondialysis CKD (<i>n</i> = 12; 19.4%) and those receiving renal transplantation (<i>n</i> = 11; 17.7%). Contributors to frailty in CKD patients included sociodemographic factors, smoking, CKD severity, organ-specific comorbidities, depression, hypoalbuminemia, and low testosterone levels. Conversely, the development of frailty was potentially associated with the emergence of cardiometabolic, musculoskeletal, and cerebral complications; mental distress; and a higher risk of subsequent functional and quality-of-life impairment. Moreover, frailty in CKD patients increased healthcare utilization and consistently elevated mortality among affected ones.

Although ameliorative therapies against ischemic injury have remarkably reduced death rates among patients, they are inevitably complicated by reperfusion injury. Therefore, it is essential to explore other approaches to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Modulating the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a promising therapeutic strategy against some aging-related diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the role of NAD+ in a swine model of myocardial IRI. Fourteen Bama miniature pigs were subjected to 90 min transluminal balloon occlusion, and then randomly administrated with 20 mg/kg NAD+ or saline before reperfusion. Emission computerized tomography (ECT) was performed immediately and 4 weeks after reperfusion, and the cardiac tissues were analyzed histologically. In addition, the levels of cardiac function markers and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were also measured. NAD+ administration markedly reduced myocardial necrosis, enhanced glucose metabolism, and promoted cardiac function recovery. The extent of inflammation was also reduced in the NAD+ treated animals, and corresponded to less cardiac fibrosis and better ventricular compliance. Thus, NAD+ supplementation protected the myocardium from IRI, making it a promising therapeutic agent against acute myocardial ischemic disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>AJTR Copyright © 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

RDS is invaluable to the study of hard-to-reach populations. However, RDS is costly and can be infeasible. RDS is infeasible when RDS point estimators have small effective sample sizes (large design effects) or when RDS interval estimators have large confidence intervals relative to estimates obtained in previous studies or poor coverage. As a result, researchers need tools to assess whether or not estimation of certain characteristics of interest for specific populations is feasible in advance. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based framework for using pilot data-in the form of a convenience sample of aggregated, egocentric data and estimates of subpopulation sizes within the target population-to assess whether or not RDS is feasible for estimating characteristics of a target population. in doing so, we assume that more is known about egos than alters in the pilot data, which is often the case with aggregated, egocentric data in practice. We build on existing methods for estimating the structure of social networks from aggregated, egocentric sample data and estimates of subpopulation sizes within the target population. We apply this framework to assess the feasibility of estimating the proportion male, proportion bisexual, proportion depressed and proportion infected with HIV/AIDS within three spatially distinct target populations of older lesbian, gay and bisexual adults using pilot data from the caring and Aging with Pride Study and the Gallup Daily Tracking Survey. We conclude that using an RDS sample of 300 subjects is infeasible for estimating the proportion male, but feasible for estimating the proportion bisexual, proportion depressed and proportion infected with HIV/AIDS in all three target populations.</AbstractText>"}

Echographic examination was consistent with a median-nerve schwannoma, and was confirmed upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Excision of the nodule was readily performed without significant neural damage, and its schwannoma nature was confirmed upon immunohistochemistry analysis. Importantly, blood PSA dropped abruptly from ≈13 to ≈5 ng/ml within 2 months postschwannoma resection, a swift drastic reduction unachievable with oral dutasteride alone. However, 6 weeks later, a new nodule became apparent on the back of the left knee and was identified as a second schwannoma, thereby suggesting that its growth could have been stimulated by the resection of the first schwannoma, as previously described for vestibular schwannomas. The second schwannoma was in fact two: the bigger one was in the common fibular nerve and the smaller one in the tibial nerve. Both echography and MRI results were confirmed upon surgical resection of the bigger knee schwannoma. Although the third schwannoma has not yet been resected and formally characterized, we face a schwannomatosis case with an unexpected potential exosome-mediated stimulating effect on PSA secretion (PSA immunohistochemistry was negative on both schwannomas). On the other hand, preliminary genomic analysis showed a deficient balance for chromosome 22, the very chromosome carrying the three main genes involved in schwannomatosis. This age-related schwannomatosis case is thus discussed in light of the following: age-related DNA repair deficiency culminating in loss of chromosome/heterozygosity; CpG methylation/demethylation-based epigenetic aging; age-related functional decline of the immune system responsible for inefficient elimination of abnormal cells and subsequent tumorigenic cell turn-over; exosome-mediated pathologic intercellular communications; and prostate-invading brain neural progenitors as pathologic peripheral nervous system (PNS) cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s), 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Deregulated MALT1 activity has been associated with immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and cancer in mice and humans. Genetically engineered mice expressing catalytically inactive MALT1, still exerting its scaffold function, were previously shown to spontaneously develop autoimmunity due to a decrease in Tregs associated with increased effector T cell activation. In contrast, complete absence of MALT1 does not lead to autoimmunity, which has been explained by the impaired effector T cell activation due to the absence of MALT1-mediated signaling.

Similar to Chikungunya (CHIKV) and other arthritogenic Alphavirus, MAYV-induced disease shows a high prevalence of persistent arthralgia, and myalgia. Despite this, knowledge regarding pathogenesis and characteristics of host immune response of MAYV infections are still limited. Here, using different ages of wild-type (WT), adult Type I Interferon receptor deficient (IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup>), and adult recombination activation gene-1 deficient (RAG<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, we have investigated the dependence of age, innate and adaptive immunity for the control of MAYV replication, tissue damage, and inflammation in mice. We have found that MAYV induces clinical signal and replicates in young WT mice, which gain the ability to restrict MAYV replication with aging. In addition, we observed that mice age and type I interferon response are related to restriction of MAYV infection and muscular inflammation in mice. Moreover, MAYV continues to replicate persistently in RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice, being detected at blood and tissues 40 days post infection, indicating that adaptive immunity is essential to MAYV clearance. Despite chronic replication, infected adult RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not develop an apparent signal of muscle damage in early and late infection. On the other hand, MAYV infection in young WT and adult IFNAR-/- mice triggers an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF, IL-6, KC, IL-1β, MCP-1, and RANTES, in muscle tissue, and decreases TGF-β expression, that were not significantly modulated in adult WT and RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken together, our data demonstrated that age, innate and adaptive immunity are important to restrict MAYV replication and that adaptive immunity is also involved in MAYV-induced tissue damage. These results contribute to the comprehension of MAYV pathogenesis, and describe translational mice models for further studies of MAYV infection, vaccine tests, and therapeutic strategies against this virus.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Figueiredo, Neris, Gavino-Leopoldino, Silva, Almeida, dos-Santos, Figueiredo, Bellio, Bozza and Assunção-Miranda.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) is a well-validated tool for assessing malnutrition in old people. It includes 6 (MNA-SF) or 18 (MNA-LF) self-reported questions derived from general, anthropometric, dietary, and self- assessment. We evaluated the association between the nutritional status, as measured by MNA, and methylation biomarkers we previously demonstrated to be associated with chronological and biological age in human. We found that malnutrition is positively correlated with DNA methylation status at the global level, in line with our previous reports. On the contrary, most of the sites located within specific genes, which were previously reported to be correlated with chronological and biological aging, showed to be not affected by malnutrition, or even to have correlations with malnutrition opposite to those previously reported with frailty. These results may suggest that malnutrition is among the first effects of disability and other age- related problems and a generalized non-specific epigenetic remodeling may be the initial response of the organism. By contrast, the fine remodeling of specific genomic sites is scarcely affected by malnutrition and may respond to a more complex interaction of different factors. Therefore, although malnutrition in the elderly is certainly a risk factor for survival, this is partially independent of the aging process of the organism which leads to the methylation remodeling previously described to measure chronological and biological aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Montesanto, D'Aquila, Rossano, Passarino and Bellizzi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Health care providers are expected to develop innovative solutions to manage and follow up patients over time in the community. To date, we are unable to continuously and accurately monitor the nature, frequency, severity, impact, progression, and response to treatment of BPSDs after the initial assessment. Technology could address this need and provide more sensitive, less biased, and more ecologically valid measures. This could provide an opportunity to reevaluate therapeutic strategies more quickly and, in some cases, to treat earlier, when symptoms are still amenable to therapeutic solutions or even prevention. Several studies confirm the relationship between sensor-based data and cognition, mood, and behavior. Most scientific work on mental health and technologies supports digital biomarkers, not so much as diagnostic tools but rather as monitoring tools, an area where unmet needs are significant. In addition to the implications for clinical care, these real-time measurements could lead to the discovery of new early biomarkers in mental health. Many also consider digital biomarkers as a way to better understand disease processes and that they may contribute to more effective pharmaceutical research by (i) targeting the earliest stage, (ii) reducing sample size required, (iii) providing more objective measures of behaviors, (iv) allowing better monitoring of noncompliance, (v) and providing a better understanding of failures.

This FW index measures the fraction of the diffusion signal explained by isotropically unconstrained water, as estimated from a bi-tensor model. In this study, we developed a simple but powerful whole-brain FW measure designed for easy translation to clinical settings and potential use as a priori outcome measure in clinical trials. These simple FW measures use a 'safe' white matter (WM) mask without gray matter (GM)/CSF partial volume contamination (<i>WM</i><sub>safe</sub>) near ventricles and sulci. We investigated if FW inside the <i>WM</i><sub>safe</sub> mask, including and excluding areas of white matter damage such as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) as shown on T2 FLAIR, computed across the whole white matter could be indicative of diagnostic grouping along the AD continuum. After careful quality control, 81 cognitively normal controls (NC), 103 subjects with MCI and 42 with AD were selected from the ADNIGO and ADNI2 databases. We show that MCI and AD have significantly higher FW measures even after removing all partial volume contamination. We also show, for the first time, that when WMHs are removed from the masks, the significant results are maintained, which demonstrates that the FW measures are not just a byproduct of WMHs. Our new and simple FW measures can be used to increase our understanding of the role of inflammation-associated edema in AD and may aid in the differentiation of healthy subjects from MCI and AD patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Dumont, Roy, Jodoin, Morency, Houde, Xie, Bauer, Samad, Van Dijk, Goodman and Descoteaux.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Nowadays, it is the world's fourth most deadly cancer with almost 900 000 deaths annually. Besides an ageing population and dietary habits of high-income countries, unfavourable risk factors such as obesity, lack of physical exercise, and smoking increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Advancements in pathophysiological understanding have increased the array of treatment options for local and advanced disease leading to individual treatment plans. Treatments include endoscopic and surgical local excision, downstaging preoperative radiotherapy and systemic therapy, extensive surgery for locoregional and metastatic disease, local ablative therapies for metastases, and palliative chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Although these new treatment options have doubled overall survival for advanced disease to 3 years, survival is still best for those with non-metastasised disease. As the disease only becomes symptomatic at an advanced stage, worldwide organised screening programmes are being implemented, which aim to increase early detection and reduce morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Neutrophil depletion significantly attenuated itch-evoked scratching in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Neutrophils were also required for several key hallmarks of chronic itch, including skin hyperinnervation, enhanced expression of itch signaling molecules, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, activity-induced genes, and markers of neuropathic itch. Finally, we demonstrate that neutrophils are required for induction of CXCL10, a ligand of the CXCR3 receptor that promotes itch via activation of sensory neurons, and we find that that CXCR3 antagonism attenuates chronic itch.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, Walsh et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

From these, nutrition is a key component affecting our health, and several studies particularly in model organisms and rodents have shown that nutrition has also the potential to increase lifespan. This review, therefore, aimed to summarize and discuss the most important nutritional components and diets which have been repeatedly associated with longevity. A brief summary of mechanistic factors involved, like for example mTor, IGF-1, and autophagy, will also be presented. Finally, the association of foods and diets with all-cause mortality will be summarized by conducting a mini umbrella review of available meta-analyses. The main conclusions of this review are that caloric restriction without malnutrition, methionine restriction, lower protein intake or supplementation of spermidine are major life-extending factors, in model organisms or rodents. In humans, certain healthy foods are associated with longer telomere length, and reductions in protein intake with lower IGF-1 levels, respectively, both relations being associated with longer lifespan. Furthermore, a high intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and also coffee is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality whereas a high intake of (red) meat and especially processed meat is positively related to all-cause mortality. In addition, the Mediterranean and also high-quality diets are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.</AbstractText>"}

To investigate the involvement of circRNA in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we performed a circRNA microarray analysis on paired DLBCL and normal tissues. We identified a novel and highly stable circRNA originating from the back-splicing of <i>APC</i> exon 7 to exon 14, circ-APC (hsa_circ_0127621), which was downregulated in DLBCL tissues, cell lines and plasma. In gain-of-function experiments, ectopic expression of circ-APC inhibited DLBCL cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i> and tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Cytoplasmic circ-APC functioned as a sponge for miR-888, thus post-transcriptionally upregulating <i>APC</i> by alleviating the repressive effects of miR-888 on this gene. Further, nuclear circ-APC bound to the <i>APC</i> promoter and recruited the DNA demethylase TET1, thereby transcriptionally upregulating <i>APC</i>. Upon its upregulation, APC dampened the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by reducing the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, thereby retarding DLBCL growth. Clinically, circ-APC was found to be an effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for patients with DLBCL. Our study suggests that circ-APC is a novel proliferation inhibitor, and that restoring circ-APC expression may be a promising therapeutic approach for DLBCL patients.</AbstractText>"}

This study is designed to investigate the underlying function and mechanism of a novel lncRNA GAS5 in the progression of DN. We found that lncRNA GAS5 expression level was decreased in type 2 diabetes (T2D) with DN compared with that in patients without DN. Moreover, lncRNA GAS5 expression level was negatively associated with the severity of DN-related complications. lncRNA GAS5 inhibited MCs proliferation and caused G0/1 phase arrest. lncRNA GAS5 overexpression alleviated the expression of fibrosis-related protein in mesangial cells (MCs). The dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay results revealed that lncRNA GAS5 functions as an endogenous sponge for miR-221 via both the directly targeting way and Ago2-dependent manner. Furthermore, SIRT1 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-221. lncRNA GAS5 upregulated SIRT1 expression and inhibited MCs proliferation and fibrosis by acting as an miR-221 sponge. Finally, we found that lncRNA GSA5 suppressed the development of DN in vivo.

Here, we report that the TGF-β receptor inhibitor, LY2109761 (LY), is a potential radiosensitizer both in vitro and in vivo. As per the Cancer Genome Atlas database, TGF-β overexpression is significantly related to poor overall survival in GC patients. We demonstrated that the TGF-β/SMAD4 signaling pathway was activated in both radioresistant GC cells and radioresistant GC patients. As a TGF-β receptor inhibitor, LY can enhance the activities of irradiation by inhibiting cell proliferation, decreasing clonogenicity and increasing apoptosis. Moreover, LY attenuated the radiation-induced migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory factor activation, immunosuppression, and cancer stem cell characteristics of GC cells, thus leading to radiosensitization of the GC cells. We confirmed that LY reduced tumor growth, inhibited TGF-β/SMAD4 pathway activation and reversed irradiation-induced EMT in a tumor xenograft model. Our findings indicate that the novel TGF-β receptor inhibitor, LY, increases GC radiosensitivity by directly regulating the TGF-β/SMAD4 signaling pathway. These findings provide new insight for radiotherapy in GC patients.</AbstractText>"}

Our results demonstrate that Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) expression was downregulated in response to LPS-induced neuroinflammation. In addition, overexpression of Sirt3 attenuated LPS-induced BV-2 cell death. Functional studies illustrated that Sirt3 overexpression promoted normal mitochondrial function and inhibited mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. At the molecular level, suppressor of ras val-2 (SRV2) promoted LPS-mediated mitochondrial damage by inducing mitochondrial fission. Sirt3 overexpression, which suppressed the transcription of SRV2 and thus suppressed mitochondrial fission, played an anti-apoptotic role in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Furthermore, Sirt3 inhibited SRV2 expression via the Mst1-JNK pathway, and re-activation of this pathway abolished the protective effects of Sirt3 on mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that Sirt3-induced, Mst1-JNK-SRV2 signaling pathway-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial fission protected against neuroinflammation-mediated cell damage in BV-2 microglia. Sirt3 might therefore be an effective treatment for neuroinflammation.</AbstractText>"}

Although aging is associated with impaired memory formation, it is not known whether the synaptic underpinnings of memory storage differ with age. Using a training schedule that results in the same behavioral memory formation in young and aged mice, we examined synapse ultrastructure and molecular signaling in the hippocampus after contextual fear conditioning. Only in young, but not old mice, contextual fear memory formation was associated with synaptic changes that characterize well-known, long-term potentiation, a strengthening of existing synapses with one input. Instead, old-age memory was correlated with generation of multi-innervated dendritic spines (MISs), which are predominantly two-input synapses formed by the attraction of an additional excitatory, presynaptic terminal onto an existing synapse. Accordingly, a blocker used to inhibit MIS generation impaired contextual fear memory only in old mice. Our results reveal how the synaptic basis of hippocampal memory storage changes with age and suggest that these distinct memory-storing mechanisms may explain impaired updating in old age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Trehalose is a natural sugar widely found in many edible plants, animals and natural microorganisms, and recent studies have suggested that trehalose is an antioxidant, although its underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the protective mechanism of trehalose against oxidative stress-induced senescence. In the mouse model of d-galactose (D-gal) induced aging, we found that trehalose significantly reversed the learning and memory impairment caused by D-gal and improved the ability to explore unknown things, which was associated with a significant reduction in brain tissue damage. Further studies have shown that trehalose activates the expressions of downstream target genes HO-1, NQO1, SOD, GSH and CAT by promoting the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the liver. The detoxification ability of organs is increased, antioxidant enzyme activity is enhanced, lipid peroxidation is reduced, and the secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, il-6 is decreased.

Here, we present the SynGenes cohort, the largest genotyped collection of unrelated people with grapheme-colour synaesthesia (<i>n</i> = 723). Synaesthesia has been associated with a range of other neuropsychological traits, including enhanced memory and mental imagery, as well as greater sensory sensitivity. Motivated by the prior literature on putative trait overlaps, we investigated polygenic scores derived from published genome-wide scans of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), comparing our SynGenes cohort to 2181 non-synaesthetic controls.

They have played pivotal roles in the evolution of photosensing mechanisms in microbes and of vision in animals. Several groups of phytoflagellates developed a photoreceptive organelle called the eyespot apparatus (EA) consisting of two separable components: the eyespot, a cluster of carotenoid-rich globules that acts as a reflector device, and actual photoreceptors for photobehaviors. Unlike other algal eyespots, the eyespot of Euglenophyta lacks reflective properties and is generally considered to act as a shading device for the photoreceptor (paraflagellar body, PFB) for major photomovements. However, the function of the eyespot of Euglenophyta has not yet been fully proven. Here, we report that the blocking carotenoid biosynthesis in Euglena gracilis by suppressing the phytoene synthase gene (crtB) caused a defect in eyespot function resulting in a loss of phototaxis. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy suggested that EgcrtB-suppressed cells formed eyespot globules but had a defect in the accumulation of carotenoids in those packets. Motion analysis revealed the loss of phototaxis in EgcrtB-suppressed cells: a defect in the initiation of turning movements immediately after a change in light direction, rather than a defect in the termination of cell turning at the appropriate position due to a loss of the shading effect on the PFB. This study revealed that carotenoids are essential for light perception by the EA for the initiation of phototactic movement by E. gracilis, suggesting one possible photosensory role of carotenoids in the EA for the phototaxis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

A well-known source of sulfurous and oligomer medicinal mineral waters is located in Caramanico Terme (Pescara, Italy). Caramanico Terme is a small town in the Majella's National Park, and its precious and peculiar environment offers a medicinal mineral water (also known as cures or crenotherapy), that since 1576 is administrated to a large number of patients (around 15,000 per year). However, no scientific conclusions on the efficacy of Caramanico's Terme medicinal mineral water properties are available. Therefore, we have carried out an epidemiological study, enrolling a population of 370 subjects that have received crenotherapy. Such a population has been also compared to a control group of individuals (untreated, N = 287), never undergone any medicinal mineral water administration. Detailing the geomorphological characteristics of Caramanico Terme environment, we have also analyzed the results of the study that showed that pathology-relapses, as well as related manifestations of symptoms and drug employments, were largely reduced after one or more cycles of crenotherapy. On the other hand, a sub-group of subjects receiving crenotherapy for more than 5 years (N = 166) presented a highly reduced prevalence of a large spectrum of pathologies (cardiovascular, inflammatory, neurological and cancer diseases), with respect to an overlapping population (in terms of age and genders) of untreated subjects. We have also clarified the role of aging and long-term effects of medicinal mineral-water administration. Altogether, these data indicated that the clinical employment of Caramanico's Terme medicinal mineral water produces short- as well as long-term beneficial effects, both with respect to the amelioration of life quality of patients and in reducing the probability to develop major disabling pathologies (i.e., cardiovascular, cancer and neurological diseases). Therefore, these data will open novel strategies for a larger application of crenotherapy.</AbstractText>"}

This study investigated whether autophagy plays a role in Klotho gene deficiency-induced arterial stiffening and hypertension. Klotho mutant heterozygous (KL+/-) mice and age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) mice were used. Arteries were examined for autophagy using Western blot assays. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a direct measure of arterial stiffness, and blood pressure (BP) increased significantly in KL (+/-) mice. The autophagy level, as measured by LC3-II expression and autophagy flux, increased in aortas of KL (+/-) mice, indicating that Klotho gene deficiency upregulated autophagy. Chloroquine diminished Klotho gene deficiency-induced increases in PWV and BP and eliminated the upregulation of autophagic flux in KL (+/-) mice. Klotho gene deficiency-induced arterial stiffness was accompanied by upregulation of MMP9, TGFβ-1, TGFβ-3, RUNX2, and ALP, but these changes were effectively mitigated by chloroquine. Chloroquine also halted an increase in scleraxis expression in aortas of Klotho (+/-) mice. In cultured mouse aortic smooth muscle cells, Klotho gene deficiency increased autophagy, leading to upregulation of scleraxis, a key transcription factor of collagen synthesis. Klotho gene deficiency failed to upregulate scleraxis expression when autophagy was inhibited, suggesting that autophagy is a critical mediator of Klotho gene deficiency-induced upregulation of scleraxis. Suppression of enhanced autophagy by chloroquine lessens Klotho gene deficiency-induced arterial stiffening and hypertension by stopping upregulation of MMP9 and scleraxis. The enhanced autophagic activity plays a crucial role in Klotho gene deficiency-induced arterial stiffening and hypertension. KEY MESSAGES: Klotho gene deficiency upregulates autophagy. Upregulation of autophagy plays a role in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffening. Autophagy regulates MMP9 activity and scleraxis expression.</AbstractText>"}

We submit that this practice is unnecessary and potentially harmful. Despite restoring the blood pressure, phenylephrine, for instance, may have an additive or synergistic effect with propofol in reducing the cardiac output and, ultimately, organ perfusion. Airway instrumentation often leads to sympathetic activation and hypertension (thereby increasing myocardial oxygen consumption) which may be exacerbated by an arbitrary prophylactic dose of phenylephrine. Finally, in spite of the well-recognized need to reduce dosages of propofol in frail patients, excessive doses are commonly given, leading to hypotension.

New intervention strategies are needed to overcome the long-lasting effects of ischemic injury. Previous studies determined that treatment with 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (MICA) conferred chemical preconditioning and neuroprotection against stroke. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the preconditioning can lead to functional improvements after stroke (done by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion). After 4 weeks of MICA feeding, half the rats underwent ischemic injury, while the other half remained intact. After one week recovery, all the rats were tested for motor and cognitive function (rotorod and water maze). At the time of euthanasia, measurements of long-term potentiation (LTP) were performed. While stroke injury led to motor and cognitive dysfunction, MICA supplementation did not reverse these impairments. However, MICA supplementation did improve stroke-related impairments in hippocampal LTP. The dichotomy of the outcomes suggest that more studies are needed to determine optimum duration and dosage for MICA to lead to substantial motor and cognitive improvements, along with LTP change and neuroprotection.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier B.V.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Rho-Kinase (Rock) signaling has been demonstrated as a crucial mechanism related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. This kinase is involved in the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation, leading to glucose uptake stimulation in the skeletal muscle; however, the mechanisms elucidating the role of Rock regulation in the context of advanced ages are still limited. In this study, we submitted old Fischer 344 rats to short-term treadmill physical exercise protocol (5 days) and evaluated the glucose tolerance and proteins involved with Rock/insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle. Compared to young rats, the old rats showed glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and decreased phosphorylation in the proteins related to the insulin signaling pathway in the skeletal muscle, without changes in body mass and adiposity. Otherwise, when these rats were submitted to physical exercise, it was found decreased fasting glucose, higher glucose tolerance, decreased insulinemia, and upregulation of Rock2/pIRS1/pAkt/pGSK3β/GLUT4 pathway in the skeletal muscle. In summary, the aging process did not change Rock signaling, but the physical exercise was able to increase Rock2 content and insulin signaling pathway in the skeletal muscle. This finding suggests the benefic role of physical exercise to advanced ages, promoting insulin-sensitive effects with Rho-kinase contribution.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

DHA is thought to be an essential nutrient required throughout the life cycle for the maintenance of overall brain health. The mode of actions of DHA and its derivatives at both cellular and molecular levels in the brain are emerging. DHA is the major prevalent fatty acid in the brain membrane. The brain maintains its fatty acid levels mainly via the uptake of plasma free fatty acids. Therefore, circulating plasma DHA is significantly related to cognitive abilities during ageing and is inversely associated with cognitive decline. The signaling pathways of DHA and its metabolites are involved in neurogenesis, antinociceptive effects, anti-apoptotic effect, synaptic plasticity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in brain diseases, and the functioning of nigrostriatal activities. Mechanisms of action of DHA metabolites on various processes in the brain are not yet well known. Epidemiological studies support a link between low habitual intake of DHA and a higher risk of brain disorders. A diet characterized by higher intakes of foods containing high in n-3 fatty acids, and/or lower intake of n-6 fatty acids was strongly associated with a lower Alzheimer's Disease and other brain disorders. Supplementation of DHA improves some behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior, as well as cognition. Nevertheless, the outcomes of trials with DHA supplementation have been controversial. Many intervention studies with DHA have shown an apparent benefit in brain function. However, clinical trials are needed for definitive conclusions. Dietary deficiency of n-3 fatty acids during fetal development in utero and the postnatal state has detrimental effects on cognitive abilities. Further research in humans is required to assess a variety of clinical outcomes, including quality of life and mental status, by supplementation of DHA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 ISDN.

This exploratory study investigated the benefits of a 12-week exercise program for older adults (n = 11 control and n = 13 intervention) living in a residential aged care facility in Perth, Western Australia. The program, prescribed and delivered by an accredited exercise physiologist, aimed to maintain or improve participants' physical capacity. It comprised one-on-one exercise sessions (1 hr × 2 days/week × 12 weeks), involving a components-approach intervention. Physical performance measures (balance, strength, flexibility, and mobility) were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Qualitative interviews postintervention with residents participating in the exercise intervention, and with family members, staff, and research team members, explored barriers and enablers to participation and perceived psychosocial outcomes. Findings indicate the program provided physical benefits and enhanced social engagement for participants, illustrating the value of providing exercise physiology services in the aged care sector.</AbstractText>"}

A total of 35 women, either PERI-M or POST-M, participated in 10 weeks of RT. Body composition, muscle strength, and serum estradiol and CAF were determined before and after the RT. The data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (p ≤ .05). Upper body and lower body strength was significantly increased, by 81% and 73% and 86% and 79% for the PERI-M and POST-M participants, respectively; however, there were no significant changes in body composition. Estradiol was significantly less for the POST-M participants at pretraining compared with the PERI-M participants. CAF moderately increased by 22% for the PERI-M participants in response to RT, whereas it significantly decreased by 49% for the POST-M participants. Ten weeks of RT reduced the circulating CAF in the POST-M women and might play a role in attenuating degenerative neuromuscular junction changes.</AbstractText>"}

For older adults, task errors were negatively correlated with force fluctuation complexity (pursuit tracking: r = -.527 to -.551; compensatory tracking: r = -.626 to -.750). Notwithstanding an age-related increase in total force complexity (p = .004), older adults exhibited lower complexity of the stochastic force component than young adults did (low frequency: p = .017; high frequency: p = .035). Those older adults with a higher complexity of stochastic force had better task performance due to the underlying use of a richer gradation strategy to compensate for impaired oscillatory control.</AbstractText>"}

The sport is especially popular with older adults as it provides a means for both competition and exercise. Limited research is available on the motivation and perceived benefits of participants in this unique and growing community. A total of 3,012 participants completed a survey instrument that included items from the Sport Motivation Scale, the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire, and the Quality and Importance of Recreational Services. Participants reported being more task oriented than ego oriented, suggesting that pickleball may effectively satisfy the need for persons to be engaged in physical activities that allow for the ongoing development of personal mastery. This finding is supported by respondents noting that their primary motivation to participate in pickleball involved mastering difficult training techniques. However, participants cited competition as the top perceived benefit to their participation. This result supports two possible conclusions that motivation and benefit are different and potentially disconnected constructs or that the benefit of competition among this sample of older persons is understood through the lens of personal mastery, whereby the demonstration of that mastery is only possible through competition.</AbstractText>"}

The hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) is arguably one of the best such models, as it exhibits both the male kin bonding and the cross-sex pair bonding thought to have been important in hominin evolution. Here we link processes of behavioral evolution in hamadryas baboons with those in a Plio-Pleistocene hominin, provisionally identified as Homo erectus (sensu lato) - a pivotal species in that its larger body and brain size and wider ranging patterns increased female costs of reproduction, increasing the importance of sociality. The combination of these higher costs of reproduction and shifts in diet and food acquisition have previously been argued to have been alleviated either via strengthening of male-female bonds (involving male provisioning and the evolution of monogamy) or via the assistance of older, post-reproductive females (leading to post-reproductive longevity in females, i.e., the grandmother hypothesis). We suggest that both arrangements could have been present in Plio-Pleistocene hominins if they lived in multilevel societies. Here we expand on our earlier scenario with two sets of recent data in support of it, (1) archaeological data from the 2 million year old Oldowan site of Kanjera South, Kenya and other sites that are suggestive of tool dependent foraging on nutrient dense resources (animal carcasses and plant underground storage organs), cooperation, and food sharing; and (2) a pattern of genetic variation in hamadryas baboons that suggests the operation of kin selection among both males and females at multiple levels of society. Taken together, these two sets of data strengthen our model and support the idea of a complex society linked by male-male, male-female, and female-female bonds at multiple levels of social organization in Plio-Pleistocene hominins.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The first phase of the study compared the LumiFume™ system with traditional cabinet fuming and black/white powder suspension for the development of latent fingermarks on a variety of surfaces (glass, plastic bin bag, laminated wood and tile) by means of depletion series' from 10 donors and four ageing periods (1, 7, 14 and 28 days). The portable fuming system provided superior quality of developed marks on glass and laminated wood whereas powder suspension was better on bin bags and all three techniques were comparable on tile. A decrease in mark quality was recorded from 1 to 14 days for the fuming techniques before an increase at 28 days. Lumicyano™ fluorescence stability studies over a 28 day period by means of depletion series' on glass slides and plastic bin bags revealed better quality marks for the portable system LumiFume™; however, storing marks under light conditions expedited deterioration for both systems. All marks developed with Lumicyano™ were subsequently treated with BY40 resulting in further improvement in mark quality for all substrates and ageing periods, with the exception of laminated wood which absorbed the fluorescent stain reducing the contrast in the process. The second phase of the study consisted of a pseudo-operational trial on 300 various substrates (e.g. glass bottles, aluminium cans, plastic bags) recovered from recycling bins. LumiFume™ and Lumicyano™ yielded 1469 marks whereas Lumicyano™ cabinet fuming and powder suspension yielded 1026 and 641 marks respectively. Similar to the first phase of the study, further treatment of the Lumicyano™ treated marks with BY40 resulted in further quality improvement as well as additional new marks. The LumiFume™ system produced results at least equivalent to the traditional cabinet fuming with Lumicyano™ highlighting its potential for implementation into casework to process crime scenes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Results demonstrated less caudate activity for older adults (70-80 years; n = 112) compared with the younger age group (25-65 years; n = 191), suggesting age-related functional differences in this region. Importantly, there was a gene-related difference regarding WM performance and frontostriatal brain activity. Specifically, better WM performance and greater activity in PFC were found among C957T C allele carriers. Combined genetic markers for increased DA D2 receptor density were associated with greater caudate activity and higher WM updating performance. The genetic effects on blood oxygen level-dependent activity were only observed in older participants, suggesting magnified genetic effects in aging.

A potential target of Aβ42 is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Three major subtypes of nAChRs (α7, α4β2, and α3β4) have been reported in the human hippocampus. Simultaneous inhibition of both α7 and α4β2 nAChRs mimicked the Aβ42 effects on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. However, inhibition of all 3 subtypes showed the opposite effect.

After heart attack, the first wave of innate responsive and short-lived neutrophils is essential for the initiation of inflammation, resolution of inflammation, and cardiac repair, however uncontrolled and long-term activation of neutrophils leads to collateral damage of myocardium. In the presented review, we highlighted the interactive and integrative role of neutrophil phenotypes in cellular and molecular events of ischemic HF.

Despite a high degree of heterogeneity, AD is still explained by type 2 immunity, and the role of IL-17A, which is increased in acute, pediatric, or Asian patients with AD, remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-17A-producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which are unexplored immune cells, in the pathogenesis of AD. We found that the numbers of ILC3s in the skin of AD-induced mice were increased, and that neutralizing IL-17A delayed development of AD. Moreover, adoptive transfer of ILC3s accelerated the symptoms of AD. Mechanically, ILC3s induced IL-33 production by nonimmune skin cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, which promoted type 2 immune responses. Because AD has a complex pathophysiology and a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, the presence of ILC3s in the skin and their interaction with nonimmune skin cells could explain the pathogenesis of cutaneous AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Between 2001 and 2016, fuel reduction (e.g., thinning, prescribed burning, etc.) was implemented on over 26 million hectares of federal lands alone in the United States, reflecting the urgency to mitigate risk from high-severity wildfire. However, between 2001 and 2012, nearly 20 million hectares in the United States were impacted by mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), compounding restoration effects in wildfire-hazard-treated stands. Knowledge of the effects of treatments followed by natural disturbance on long-term forest structure and communities is needed, especially considering that fuel treatments are increasingly being implemented and warming climate is predicted to exacerbate disturbance frequency and severity. We tested the interacting effects of treatments designed to reduce high-severity wildfire hazard in stands subsequently challenged by MPB outbreak on vegetation dynamics using a factorial experimental design (control, thin only, burn only, thin + burn) in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated forest. Stands were treated by 2002, then impacted by MPB outbreak from 2005 to 2012. We assessed change in overstory and understory forest community structure, composition, and diversity over time. There were distinct thinning, burning, and year effects. Thinning immediately reduced overstory density; pine density then declined 4.5 times more in unthinned than thinned treatments due to MPB. Burning immediately reduced graminoid, shrub, and total understory cover by as much as 52%, resulting in greater species evenness than unburned treatments, but differences disappeared by 2016 due to growth and MPB outbreak. Similarly, multivariate analyses indicated forest communities were starkly different after treatment but became more similar over time, though key understory and overstory attributes still distinguish control and thin + burn. This study shows the value of long-term silvicultural experiments to evaluate treatment longevity and the compounded effects of treatment and natural disturbance. We demonstrate the homogenizing effects of treatment-induced growth coupled with MPB-caused tree mortality on management strategies that just treat the overstory (thinning) or understory (burning), showing that only combined treatments can provide the unique structural and compositional outcomes expected of restoration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Prior research has shown that older adults are able to monitor strategically, which involves the activation of monitoring when contextually appropriate and deactivation of monitoring when it is not thereby affording conservation of limited-capacity attentional resources. However, the time course and efficiency with which these processes operate with increased age are unknown. In the current study, participants performed an ongoing lexical decision task in which words/nonwords were blocked by font color in sets of ten trials (ten red trials followed by ten blue trials). Importantly, participants were informed that PM targets ('TOR' syllable) would only occur in red trials. Replicating previous work, both younger and older adults were successfully able to disengage monitoring upon encountering the unexpected (i.e., blue) context. However, while younger adults completely disengaged monitoring in the unexpected context, older adults continued to show monitoring across the majority of trials. Additionally, younger, but not older, adults showed a re-engagement of monitoring at the end of the unexpected context in preparation for the upcoming expected context. These findings suggest that while strategic monitoring generally remains intact with increased age, the disengagement and preparatory re-engagement of strategic monitoring may operate less optimally for older adults.</AbstractText>"}

Aged cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) are considered novel model animals for studying CKD, especially as the females develop severe tubulointerstitial lesions with anemia. To investigate the renal pathologic features in aged male cotton rats and their characteristic glomerular injuries, the animals were divided into young, adult, old-aged, and advanced-aged groups (1-4, 5-8, 9-12, and 13-17 months, respectively) and pathologically analyzed. Anemia and renal dysfunction, as indicated by hematologic and serologic parameters, were significantly milder in the advanced-aged males than in the old-aged females. The males had increased urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios from the old-age period, with the advanced-aged males having significantly higher levels than those in the old-aged females and young males. The old-aged females did not show clear glomerular injuries, whereas the advanced-aged males showed membranous lesions characterized by irregular and thickened glomerular basement membranes (GBMs). Characteristically, several large-sized projections from the GBM toward the podocytes were observed by microscopy, and podocytes covering these projections effaced their foot processes. The advanced-aged males showed aging-related IgG immune-complex depositions in the paramesangial regions and along the GBM. Furthermore, the positive reaction for podocin (a podocyte molecule) was granulated along the GBM. Thus, we clarified the albuminuria associated with altered glomerular structures in advanced-aged cotton rats, and that these phenotypes were closely associated with aging. These data help to clarify the aging-related pathogenesis of glomerular injury.</AbstractText>"}

The objective was to systematically assess the evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for reducing the visible signs of aging. Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Scopus were searched from inception to March 2019 for prospective trials and case series assessing PRP for skin aging in 10 or more patients. Twenty-four studies, including 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), representing 480 total patients receiving PRP, were included. Based on physician global assessment, injection PRP monotherapy was shown to at least temporarily induce modest improvement in facial skin appearance, texture, and lines. Periorbital fine lines and pigmentation may also benefit. Adjuvant PRP accelerated healing after fractional laser resurfacing. Although the degree of improvement was typically less than 50%, patients generally reported high satisfaction. It was limited by heterogeneity in PRP preparation and administration, and lack of standardization in outcome measures. PRP injections are safe and may be modestly beneficial for aging skin. The evidence is most convincing for improvement of facial skin texture. The persistence of these effects is not known. More high-quality trials with sufficient follow-up are needed to optimize treatment regimens.</AbstractText>"}

The middle dose decreased mean blood pressure and prolonged repolarization period, in addition to those observed after the low dose. The high dose further decreased mean blood pressure with the reduction of total peripheral vascular resistance; however, it did not increase heart rate or cardiac output. It tended to delay atrioventricular conduction and further delayed repolarization with the prolongation of T<sub>peak</sub>-T<sub>end</sub>, whereas J-T<sub>peak</sub>c returned to its baseline level. Meanwhile, each dose of blonanserin decreased total peripheral vascular resistance, but increased heart rate, cardiac output and cardiac contractility in a dose-related manner.

However, the specific role of ELMOD3 in auditory function is still far from being elucidated. In the present study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish an Elmod3 knockout mice line in the C57BL/6 background (hereinafter referred to as Elmod3-/- mice) and investigated the role of Elmod3 in the cochlea and auditory function. Elmod3-/- mice started to exhibit hearing loss from two months of age, and the deafness progressed with aging. While the vestibular function of Elmod3-/- mice were normal. We also observed that Elmod3-/- mice showed thinning and receding hair cells in the organ of Corti (OC) and much lower expression of F-actin cytoskeleton in the cochlea compared with wild-type mice. The deafness associated with the mutation may be caused by cochlear hair cells dysfunction, which manifests with shortening and fusion of inner hair cells (IHCs) stereocilia and progressive degeneration of outer hair cells (OHCs) stereocilia. Our finding associates Elmod3 deficiencies with stereocilia dysmorphologies and reveals that it might play roles in the actin cytoskeleton dynamics in cochlear hair cells and thus relate to hearing impairment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, it is unknown if any of these parameters can be predictive of survival in centenarians. Therefore, in a group of 27 centenarians, at the time of admission to the Clinical Hospital of Madrid, a series of immune function, antioxidant, oxidant and inflammatory parameters, were studied. Some centenarians survived and others did not, establishing two groups, 'survivors' (n = 9) and 'non-survivors' (n = 18). The results show that surviving centenarians display higher neutrophil chemotaxis and microbicidal capacity, NK activity, lymphoproliferation, glutathione reductase activity and basal IL-10 release. Moreover, they show lower neutrophil and lymphocyte adherence, superoxide anion and malondialdehyde concentrations and basal release of TNF-α. The ODDS RATIOS (OR) for survival for these parameters were also calculated and those with the highest ORs were the lymphoproliferative capacity and the ex vivo basal and stimulated release of IL-6 from mononuclear cells (OR = 136.00). Therefore, these parameters have the potential to be used in the clinical setting as predictors of survival in centenarians. In the survivors group, the same parameters were also analyzed after three months. Since survivors showed an increase in neutrophil and lymphocyte chemotaxis capacity during the recovery period, reaching similar values to those observed in healthy centenarians, these could be proposed as indicators of recovery.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In metals, kinetics is primarily connected to diffusion, which for substitutional elements is enabled via mobile atomic-lattice vacancies. In fact, non-equilibrium vacancies are often required for structural changes. Rapid quenching of various important alloys, such as Al- or Mg-alloys, results for example in natural aging, i.e. slight movements of solute atoms in the material, which significantly alter the material properties. In this study we demonstrate a size effect of natural aging in an AlMgSi alloy via atom probe tomography with near-atomic image resolution. We show that non-equilibrium vacancy diffusional processes are generally stopped when the sample size reaches the nanometer scale. This precludes clustering and natural aging in samples below a certain size and has implications towards the study of non-equilibrium diffusion and microstructural changes via microscopy techniques.</AbstractText>"}

Despite countless studies of the cochlear projections of these efferent fibers in animal models, comparable data for humans are almost completely lacking. Here, we immunostained the cochlear sensory epithelium from 23 normal-aging humans (14 males and 9 females), 0-86 years of age, with cholinergic markers to quantify the normal density of MOC and LOC projections, and the degree of age-related degeneration. In younger ears, the MOC density peaks in mid-cochlear regions and falls off both apically and basally, whereas the LOC innervation peaks near the apex. In older ears, MOC density decreases dramatically, whereas the LOC density does not. The loss of MOC feedback may contribute to the age-related decrease in word recognition in noise; however, even at its peak, the MOC density is lower than in other mammals, suggesting the MOC pathway is less important for human hearing.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cochlear epithelium and its sensory innervation are modulated by the olivocochlear (OC) efferent pathway. Although the medial OC (MOC) reflex has been extensively studied in humans, via contralateral sound suppression, the cochlear projections of these cholinergic neurons have not been described in humans. Here, we use immunostaining to quantify the MOC projections to outer hair cells and lateral OC (LOC) projections to the inner hair cell area in humans 0-89 years of age. We show age-related loss of MOC, but not LOC, innervation, which likely contributes to hearing impairments, and a relative paucity of MOC terminals at all ages, which may account for the relative weakness of the human MOC reflex and the difficulty in demonstrating a robust functional role in human experiments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Using patient samples and a mouse model, we define two mechanisms of NET-mediated inflammation of the vasculature: activation of emergency granulopoiesis via granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production and induction of the endothelial cytoadhesion receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Soluble NET components facilitate parasite sequestration and mediate tissue destruction.

The index patient manifested rapid progressive dementia, seizures, and myoclonus, and a Pisa syndrome as a side effect of donepezil treatment. The PSEN1 mutation F175del was found on genetic testing. It was rendered very likely pathogenic as amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide 42 was elevated in a cell culture model compared to presenilin 1 wild-type controls. An additional, unusual increase in Aβ39 indicates a rarely observed product line deviation in the generation of the shorter Aβ species. Our observations extend the range of PSEN1 mutations to be considered in familial dementia.

Though the exact etiology of rosacea remains elusive, accumulating evidence has highlighted the dysfunction of innate immunity and inflammation in rosacea pathogenesis. Disintegrin Metalloprotease ADAM-like Decysin-1 (ADAMDEC1) is an orphan ADAM-like metalloprotease which is believed to be closely related to inflammation. Here for the first time, we reported that Adamdec1 expression was significantly increased in the skin lesions of rosacea patients and LL37-induced rosacea-like mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed co-localization of ADAMDEC1 and macrophages in patient and mouse biopsies. In cellular experiment, the expression of ADAMDEC1 was prominently elevated in M1 but not M2 macrophages. Knocking down of ADAMDEC1 significantly blunted M1 polarization in macrophages induced from human monocytes and THP-1 cell lines. Furthermore, silencing of Adamdec1 in LL-37-induced mouse model also suppressed the expression of M1 signature genes such as IL-6, iNOS and TNF-α, resulting in attenuated rosacea-like phenotype and inflammation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ADAMDEC1 plays a pro-inflammatory role in rosacea via modulating the M1 polarization of macrophages.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Flu infection is limited to pulmonary epithelial cells, yet there are many systemic symptoms and older adults are more susceptible to flu-related complications. In older adults, flu rarely comes without additional complications and there is a perfect storm for enhanced disease due to multiple factors including existing co-morbidities, plus impaired lung function and dysregulated immune responses that occur with even healthy aging. Commonly, opportunistic secondary bacterial infections prosper in damaged lungs. Intensified systemic inflammation with aging can cause dysfunction in extra-pulmonary organs and tissues such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neuropathologic, hepatic, and renal complications.

Informed by these data, we sought to develop a standard protocol for evaluation. A retrospective review of pancreas transplants (solitary pancreas and simultaneous pancreas-kidney) was undertaken at the University of Maryland.

All pancreas candidates (n = 21) who underwent left heart catheterization (LHC) demonstrated CAD (100%). No patients experienced myocardial infarction (MI) and no deaths resulted from cardiac disease in the early post-transplant period. Pancreas transplant candidates are at high risk for CAD. At a center in which pancreas transplant rates are increasing, a rigorous cardiac work up revealed that 71.7% of assessed recipients had CAD.

Multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed low ALT (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.18) and high De Ritis ratio (hazard ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.20) were independent predictors of postoperative mortality, but AST did not have a statistically significant association. The association of low ALT and high De Ritis ratio with 90-day mortality was more pronounced in patients older than 60 years (<i>P</i>-values for interaction &lt;0.05). Therefore, preoperative serum aminotransferase levels may be a valuable prognostic marker in patients with cardiovascular surgery, particularly in the elderly.</AbstractText>"}

However, their uncontrolled generation is associated with an array of pathological conditions. To identify and quantify the sources of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in skeletal muscle we used site-specific suppressors (S1QELs, S3QELs and NADPH oxidase inhibitors). We measured the rates of hydrogen peroxide release from isolated rat muscle mitochondria incubated in media mimicking the cytosol of intact muscle. By measuring the extent of inhibition caused by the addition of different site-specific suppressors of mitochondrial superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production (S1QELs for site I<sub>Q</sub> and S3QELs for site III<sub>Qo</sub>), we determined the contributions of these sites to the total signal. In media mimicking resting muscle, their contributions were each 12-18%, consistent with a previous method. In C2C12 myoblasts, site I<sub>Q</sub> contributed 12% of cellular hydrogen peroxide production and site III<sub>Qo</sub> contributed about 30%. When C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated to myotubes, hydrogen peroxide release increased five-fold, and the proportional contribution of site I<sub>Q</sub> doubled. The use of S1QELs and S3QELs is a powerful new way to measure the relative contributions of different mitochondrial sites to muscle hydrogen peroxide production under different conditions. Our results show that mitochondrial sites I<sub>Q</sub> and III<sub>Qo</sub> make a substantial contribution to superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production in muscle mitochondria and C2C12 myoblasts. The total hydrogen peroxide release rate and the relative contribution of site I<sub>Q</sub> both increase substantially upon differentiation to myotubes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In recent years, attention has been paid to the relationship between gut microbiota and brain. In aging, there is an alteration in microbiota, gut microbiota diversity is perturbed with an increase in pathogenic bacteria at the expense of beneficial ones. Dysbiosis may lead to chronic inflammation, and a decrease in bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids which have been related to an upregulation of neurotrophic factors. Supplementation with prebiotics and probiotics can modulate gut microbiota, returning it to a more physiological state; thus, they may be considered as a possible treatment for age-related cognitive impairment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The depletion of DA in midbrain due to degeneration of nigral dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons leads to Parkinson's disease (PD). DA agonist and levodopa (L-DOPA) are the only therapies used for symptomatic relief in PD. However, the role of DA receptors in PD pathogenesis and how they are associated with mitochondrial functions and DAergic neurogenesis is still not known. Here, we investigated the mechanistic aspect of DA D1 receptor mediated control of DAergic neurogenesis, motor behavior and mitochondrial functions in rat PD model. The pharmacological activation of D1 receptors markedly improved motor deficits, mitochondrial biogenesis, ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential and defended nigral DAergic neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced neurotoxicity in adult rats. However, the D1 agonist mediated effects were abolished following D1 receptor antagonist treatment in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of dynamin related protein-1 (Drp-1) by Mdivi-1 in D1 antagonist treated PD rats, significantly restored behavioral deficits, mitochondrial functions, mitochondrial biogenesis and increased the number of newborn DAergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Drp-1 inhibition mediated neuroprotective effects in PD rats were associated with increased level of protein kinase-B/Akt and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Taken together, our data suggests that dopamine D1 receptor mediated reduction in mitochondrial fission and enhanced DAergic neurogenesis may involve Drp-1 inhibition which led to improved behavioral recovery in PD rats.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Defective autophagy contributes to the etiology of an increasing number of diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. Cells have to integrate complex metabolic information in order to counteract metabolic challenges ranging from carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate to metal ion limitations. An unparalleled variety of cytoplasmic materials in size and nature can be transported into the lytic compartment for degradation and recycling by transient double-membrane compartments, termed autophagosomes, during macroautophagy. In this review, we will outline our current mechanistic understanding of how cells regulate the initiation of macroautophagy to target substrates nonselectively or selectively. With an emphasis on findings in the yeast system, we will describe the emerging principles underlying the regulation of autophagy substrate recognition, which critically shapes the scope of stress-adapted autophagy responses upon diverse metabolic challenges.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

By using a dystrophic mouse model of transient MΦ depletion, we describe a shift in identity of muscle stem cells dependent on the crosstalk between MΦs and SCs. Indeed MΦ depletion determines adipogenic conversion of SCs and exhaustion of the SC pool leading to an exacerbated dystrophic phenotype.

Its functions, not fully understood, include the conservation of energy, the regulation of our immune system and brain function through the modulation of synaptic plasticity and the elimination of substances accumulated during wakefulness. Sleep in human is characterized by two exclusive states, the non-REM and the REM -paradoxical- sleep, whose occurrence is driven by a cyclic organi zation. Sleep and wakefulness result from complex mechanisms involving a hetero geneous transition of different brain structures from one physiological state to another. The sleep duration and distribution of sleep over 24 hours are regulated by complex interconnected mechanisms, involving both the need for sleep accumulated during wakefulness -homeostatic process- and biological rhythm -mainly the circadian process- under the influence of external synchronizers like light-dark cycle. The propensity to sleep at a given moment is regulated by a physiological signal, sleepiness, in connection with the level of vigilance. The characteristics of sleep are relatively stable for a given individual because of a strong genetic determinism, but varies in duration and architecture according to age, individual habits, sleep schedules and environmental constraints. An understanding of the physiology of sleep is important for the clinician, allowing a better understanding of sleep dysfunction, responsible for various and frequent sleep disorders equiring appropriate care.</AbstractText>"}

Prior studies have identified tau-positive thorn-shaped astrocytes in the white matter that associate with a primary progressive aphasia phenotype in an AD cohort. However, a possible contribution of ARTAG copathology to AD clinical heterogeneity has yet to be systematically examined. To investigate whether ARTAG pathology contributes to atypical presentations, we mapped the presence and density of ARTAG subtypes throughout cortical and subcortical regions in a well-characterized cohort of AD cases enriched for atypical presentations.

In this paper, we review the ways though which geometrical design at the macro-, micro-, and nanoscales combined with advanced additive manufacturing techniques (3D printing) could be used to create the unusual properties of meta-biomaterials. Due to their intended applications in orthopedics, metallic and hard polymeric biomaterials have received the most attention in the literature. However, the reviewed concepts are, at least in principle, applicable to a wide range of biomaterials including ceramics and soft polymers. At the macroscale, we discuss the concepts of patient-specific implants, deployable meta-implants, and shape-morphing implants. At the microscale, we introduce the concept of multi-physics meta-biomaterials while also covering the applications of auxetic meta-biomaterials for improving the longevity of orthopedic implants. At the nanoscale, the different aspects of the geometrical design of surface nanopatterns that simultaneously stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and kill bacteria are presented. The concept of origami-based meta-biomaterials and the applications of self-folding mechanisms in the fabrication of meta-biomaterials are addressed next.

Regarding the number of errors and omissions, we only found significant differences between the young and the AMD subjects, the later making more omissions and errors respect to young healthy volunteers. Despite AMD patients made more errors likely because to their poor fixation capability, we could conclude that AMD patients, as well as healthy elderly subjects, could compensate their altered visual strategies by taking more time to perform the visual searching tasks, probably due to cortical plasticity.

Here, we searched for de novo Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in a cohort of 167 CHD patients to identify DNA segments containing potential pathogenic genes. Our search focused on new candidate disease genes within 19 deleted de novo CNVs that did not cover known CHD genes. For this study, we developed an integrated high-throughput phenotypical platform to probe for defects in cardiogenesis and cardiac output in human iPSC-derived multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (MCPs) and, in parallel, in the Drosophila in vivo heart model. Notably, knockdown in MCPs of RPL13, a ribosomal gene and SON, an RNA splicing cofactor, reduced proliferation and differentiation of cardiomyocytes, while increasing fibroblasts. In the fly, heart-specific RpL13 knockdown, predominantly at embryonic stages, resulted in a striking 'no heart' phenotype. Knockdown of Son and Pdss2, among others, caused structural and functional defects, including reduced or abolished contractility, respectively. In summary, using a combination of human genetics and cardiac model systems, we identified new genes as candidates for causing human congenital heart disease, with particular emphasis on ribosomal genes, such as RPL13. This powerful, novel approach of combining cardiac phenotyping in human MCPs and in the in vivo Drosophila heart at high throughput will allow for testing large numbers of CHD candidates, based on patient genomic data, and for building upon existing genetic networks involved in heart development and disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Synaptic plasticity and associative plasticity, the cellular basis of memory, are impaired in AD. Recent studies suggest a functional relevance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating plasticity changes in AD, as their differential expressions were reported in many AD brain regions. However, the specific role of these miRNAs in AD has not been elucidated. We have reported earlier that late long-term potentiation (late LTP) and its associative mechanisms such as synaptic tagging and capture (STC) were impaired in Aβ (1-42)-induced AD condition. This study demonstrates that expression of miR-134-5p, a brain-specific miRNA is upregulated in Aβ (1-42)-treated AD hippocampus. Interestingly, the loss of function of miR-134-5p restored late LTP and STC in AD. In AD brains, inhibition of miR-134-5p elevated the expression of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs), cAMP-response-element binding protein (CREB-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are otherwise downregulated in AD condition. The results provide the first evidence that the miR-134-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of CREB-1 and BDNF is an important molecular mechanism underlying the plasticity deficit in AD; thus demonstrating the critical role of miR-134-5p as a potential therapeutic target for restoring plasticity in AD condition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The physiological role of this deubiquitylase, however, remains largely unclear. Our recent work showed that ATX-3, the nematode orthologue of ATXN3, together with the ubiquitin-directed segregase CDC-48, regulates longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we demonstrate that the long-lived cdc-48.1; atx-3 double mutant displays reduced viability under prolonged starvation conditions that can be attributed to the loss of catalytically active ATX-3. Reducing the levels of the autophagy protein BEC-1 sensitized worms to the effect of ATX-3 deficiency, suggesting a role of ATX-3 in autophagy. In support of this conclusion, the depletion of ATXN3 in human cells caused a reduction in autophagosomal degradation of proteins. Surprisingly, reduced degradation in ATXN3-depleted cells coincided with an increase in the number of autophagosomes while levels of lipidated LC3 remained unaffected. We identified two conserved LIR domains in the catalytic Josephin domain of ATXN3 that directly interacted with the autophagy adaptors LC3C and GABARAP in vitro. While ATXN3 localized to early autophagosomes, it was not subject to lysosomal degradation, suggesting a transient regulatory interaction early in the autophagic pathway. We propose that the deubiquitylase ATX-3/ATXN3 stimulates autophagic degradation by preventing superfluous initiation of autophagosomes, thereby promoting an efficient autophagic flux important to survive starvation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Ablation of NLRP3-inflammasome protected mice from age-related increased insulin sensitivity, reduced IGF-1 and leptin/adiponectin ratio levels, and reduced cardiac damage with protection of the prolongation of the age-dependent PR interval, which is associated with atrial fibrillation by cardiovascular aging and reduced telomere shortening.

Generally, lifespans are determined by a phase in life, the reproductive lifespan, which varies among species. Numerous pathways, such as the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, the target of rapamycin pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathways, influence aging and lifespan. Components of these pathways were identified as lifespan-related genes, including genes mediating growth, metabolism, development, resistance, and other processes. Many age-related genes have been discovered in fruit flies, honeybees, and ants among other insect species. Studies of insect aging and longevity can help understand insect biology and develop new pest management technologies. In this paper, we interrogated the new Pteromalus puparum genome, from which we predicted 133 putative lifespan-related genes based on their homology with known lifespan-related genes of Drosophila melanogaster. These genes function in five signaling pathways and three physiological processes. The conserved domain structures of these genes were predicted and their expression patterns were analyzed. Amino acid sequence alignments and domain structure analysis indicate that most components remain conserved across at least six insect orders. The data in this paper will facilitate future work on parasitoid lifespans, which may have economic value in biocontrol programs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Tissue contents of total anti-oxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were analyzed. Histological and fibrotic changes were also evaluated. Treadmill exercise and L-arginine supplementation significantly alleviated aging-induced apoptosis with enhancing HSP-70 expression, increasing anti-oxidant enzyme activity, and suppressing inflammatory markers in the cardiac myocytes. Potent attenuation in apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress was indicated in the rats with the combination of L-arginine supplementation and exercise program in comparison with each group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, fibrosis percentage and collagen accumulation were significantly lower in the rats with the combination treatment of L-arginine and exercise (p &lt; 0.05). Treadmill exercise and L-arginine supplementation provided protection against age-induced increase in the myocyte loss and formation of fibrosis in the ventricle through potent suppression of oxidative stress, inflammations, and apoptosis pathways.</AbstractText>"}

What was once considered a skin only operation is now a sophisticated, elegant procedure that requires meticulous preoperative analysis, understanding of underlying anatomically based aging changes, and extreme attention to detail. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 125,697 facelifts were performed in 2017. It is not surprising that given these advances that facial rejuvenation surgery is still a very common procedure with a high degree of patient satisfaction despite the increase in nonsurgical facial aging treatments. With an improved understanding of facial anatomy including the facial retaining ligaments and intervening superficial and deep fat compartments, the modern facelift requires an anatomically targeted approach. Furthermore, the modern facelift surgeon must achieve consistently excellent results with reasonably little downtime while being aware of methods to improve the safety of this popular elective procedure. Hematoma is the most common complication after rhytidectomy with an incidence between 0.9% and 9%, with a higher incidence in males. Other potential complications include seroma, nerve injury, skin flap necrosis, siaolocele as a consequence of submandibular gland debulking, and skin flap rhytid and hairline distortion. This review aims to discuss safe, consistent, and reproducible methods to achieve success with facelift.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Consequentially, alterations in life-history strategies are closely intertwined with such interaction processes. Understanding the connection between life-history alterations and host-parasite interactions can therefore be important to unveil potential links between adaptation to environmental change and changes in interaction processes. Here, we studied how two different host-parasite interaction processes, oral and hemocoelic exposure to bacteria, affect various life histories of the Glanville fritillary butterfly <i>Melitaea cinxia</i>. We either fed or injected adult butterflies with the bacterium <i>Micrococcus luteus</i> and observed for differences in immune defenses, reproductive life histories, and longevity, compared to control exposures. Our results indicate differences in how female butterflies adapt to the two exposure types. Orally infected females showed a reduction in clutch size and an earlier onset of reproduction, whereas a reduction in egg weight was observed for hemocoelically exposed females. Both exposure types also led to shorter intervals between clutches and a reduced life span. These results indicate a relationship between host-parasite interactions and changes in life-history strategies. This relationship could cast restrictions on the ability to adapt to new environments and consequentially influence the population dynamics of a species in changing environmental conditions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, the molecular mechanisms of interactions between genetic and non-genetic factors remain unclear. Epigenetic regulation of neuronal genome may be a presumable mechanism in pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here, we performed analysis of open chromatin landscape of gene promoters in prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons from schizophrenic patients. We cataloged cell-type-based epigenetic signals of transcriptional start sites (TSS) marked by histone H3-K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) across the genome in PFC from multiple schizophrenia subjects and age-matched control individuals. One of the top-ranked chromatin alterations was found in the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus on chromosome 6 highlighting the overlap between genetic and epigenetic risk factors in schizophrenia. The chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis in human brain cells revealed the architecture of multipoint chromatin interactions between the schizophrenia-associated genetic and epigenetic polymorphic sites and distantly located HLA-DRB5 and BTNL2 genes. In addition, schizophrenia-specific chromatin modifications in neurons were particularly prominent for non-coding RNA genes, including an uncharacterized LINC01115 gene and recently identified BNRNA_052780. Notably, protein-coding genes with altered epigenetic state in schizophrenia are enriched for oxidative stress and cell motility pathways. Our results imply the rare individual epigenetic alterations in brain neurons are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.</AbstractText>"}

Synaptic dysfunction is a key part of the pathophysiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The synaptic co-chaperone, cysteine-string protein (CSP), is important for synaptic maintenance and function in <i>Drosophila</i>, mice and humans, and disruption of CSP results in synaptic degeneration. We sought to characterise synaptic ageing in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> upon genetic disruption of CSP. To do this, we focused on the worms' neuromuscular junctions, which are the best characterised synapse. CSP mutant worms did not display reduced lifespan or any neuromuscular-dependent behavioural deficits across ageing. Pharmacological interrogation of the neuromuscular synapse of CSP mutant animals showed no sign of synaptic dysfunction even at advanced age. Lastly, patch clamp analysis of neuromuscular transmission across ageing in wild-type and CSP mutant animals revealed no obvious CSP-dependent deficits. Electrophysiological spontaneous postsynaptic current analysis reinforced pharmacological observations that the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular synapse increases in strength during early ageing and remains relatively intact in old, immotile worms. Taken together, this study shows that surprisingly, despite disruption of CSP in other animals having severe synaptic phenotypes, CSP does not seem to be important for maintenance of the neuromuscular junction across ageing in <i>C. elegans</i>.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

We describe the role of plasma membrane cholesterol in OCT2 activity. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells overexpressing OCT2 (OCT2-HEK293) and wild-type HEK293 cells (WT-HEK293) were employed. Cellular cholesterol content, assessed by thin layer chromatography, was manipulated using empty methyl-<i>β</i>-cyclodextrin (m<i>β</i>cd) and cholesterol-presaturated m<i>β</i>cd (RAMEB). The effect of m<i>β</i>cd on OCT2 protein stability and oligomerization state was evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Transport activity of OCT2 was measured using [<sup>3</sup>H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>). A 20-minute incubation with m<i>β</i>cd reduced the total cellular cholesterol content by 40% to 60% as compared with that in untreated cells, without altering the content of the other main lipid species. In this condition, OCT2-mediated uptake of MPP<sup>+</sup> was reduced by ∼50%. When cells were coincubated with empty m<i>β</i>cd and RAMEB, the cholesterol content and OCT2-mediated uptake of MPP<sup>+</sup> were comparable to those in untreated cells, suggesting that the m<i>β</i>cd effect on OCT2 activity was cholesterol dependent. In untreated cells, the MPP<sup>+</sup> influx kinetics was allosteric, whereas in cells treated with m<i>β</i>cd, one binding site was observed. Our findings suggest that changes in cellular cholesterol content can dramatically alter OCT2-mediated transport, potentially resulting in abnormal tubular secretion and unexpected drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Plasma membrane cholesterol is important for the allosteric properties of OCT2. From a pharmacologic standpoint, the variability in cholesterol content stemming from certain pathophysiologic conditions such as aging and acute kidney injury should be taken into account as additional source of interpatient pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability and unexpected toxicity profile of OCT2 substrates, which can escape preclinical and clinical development.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Epigenetic modification, a genetic regulatory model, is independent of DNA sequence and plays a major role in establishing and maintaining a specific gene's expression profile. Disorders of mitochondrial metabolism can induce epigenetic reprogramming which in turn initiates aging phenotypes and degenerative diseases.

Possible symptoms include the following: (1) urgency-a compelling desire to urinate, which is difficult to defer; (2) urgency urinary incontinence-urgency leading to incontinence episodes; (3) frequency-increased frequency of wanting to pass urine; and (4) nocturia-increase in instances of getting up at night to urinate. To date, the mainstay of therapy for OAB has been antimuscarinic drugs and, more recently, the beta 3 agonist mirabegron. Ten international experts in urology, obstetrics, gynaecology, healthy ageing, and data analysis compared the benefit-risk balance of 14 OAB drugs licensed in Europe. The experts considered the importance of a favourable effect on the above four symptoms and also potential for side effects, but only three of these side effects, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness, showed clinically relevant differences among the six drugs they considered. The observations recorded here suggest interesting differences between drugs across a wide range of possible trade-offs between benefit and safety. The different recruitment criteria used for each study may influence the results seen, so they need to be treated with caution. Comparison of flexibly dosed fesoterodine studies with fixed-dose fesoterodine studies introduces an additional potential bias; definitive conclusions can be drawn only if enough comparable placebo-controlled flexible dosing studies with other drugs were available.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

Understanding the early phases of muscle weakness will help devise treatments to extend musculoskeletal health. Little is understood of the effects of muscle weakness on everyday activities such as sit-to-stand, a determinant of mobility that, in the early stages of weakness, requires upper limb compensation. This experimental and computational modelling study investigated the effects of muscle weakness on upper-extremity muscle forces of 27 healthy adults when using arm rests. Weakness of 29 upper limb muscles was simulated by individually removing each from a musculoskeletal model. Serratus anterior weakness was highlighted as detrimental, with the model unable to fully solve the loadsharing redundancy in its absence, and forces at the elbow and glenohumeral joint and in other muscles were found to be profoundly increased. Its large number of fast-twitch muscle fibres, predisposed to atrophy with age, highlight the centrality of the serratus anterior as a key determinant of mobility in this critical task and a potential source of early immobility through its preferential loss of strength and thus point to the requirement for early clinical interventions to mitigate loss.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

We determined patient-specific 'epicenters' at baseline, located each patient's epicenters in the healthy functional connectome, and derived two region-wise graph theoretical metrics to predict future atrophy: (1) shortest path length to the epicenter and (2) nodal hazard, the cumulative atrophy of a region's first-degree neighbors. Using these predictors and baseline atrophy, we could accurately predict longitudinal atrophy in most patients. The regions most vulnerable to subsequent atrophy were functionally connected to the epicenter and had intermediate levels of baseline atrophy.

She developed cognitive decline at 56 years of age, and her memory declined rapidly over one-year period from her 1st visit to the hospital. Her Mini-Mental State Examination scores dropped from 25/30 to 13/30. Two years later, she developed parkinsonian features, myoclonic jerk, and generalized seizure. As the disease progressed, aggravated diffuse brain atrophy and small-vessel ischemic lesion was also observed, and she became mute and vegetative in 4 years from the symptom onset. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy, and 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed bilateral temporoparietal hypometabolism. Plasma amyloid oligomer analysis revealed highly elevated Aβ oligomers levels in the proband patient. Family history revealed positive without biochemical confirmation because family members testified similar type of cognitive decline from the proband's mother and one of her aunt/uncle. Her half-siblings did not present any signs of memory impairment. Sanger sequencing of the proband patient revealed a novel mutation in APP gene, Val669Leu, but mutation was not found in her unaffected half-sisters. A designed algorithm by Guerreiro et al. on early-onset Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations suggested the mutation as possibly pathogenic mutation. On the other hand, PolyPhen2 and SIFT tools suggested as otherwise. Since the mutation was located nearby the β-secretase cleavage site of APP, right next to the Swedish APP (Lys,Met670/671Asn,Leu) mutation, it was named as 'Seoul APP' mutation. 3D modeling revealed that this mutation could result in significant changes in loop orientation of APP and also its intramolecular interactions. Hence, a novel APP Val669Leu mutation could alter the binding interactions between APP and β-secretase, which may influence the Aβ40 and Aβ42 generations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

MSC transplantation also serves as a promising therapy for regenerative medicine, while poor engraftment and limited survival rates are major obstacles for its clinical application. Although multiple studies have focused on investigating chemicals to improve MSC stemness and differentiation in vitro and in vivo, there is still a shortage of effective and safe agents for MSC-based regenerative medicine. Resveratrol (RSV), a nonflavonoid polyphenol phytoalexin with a stilbene structure, was first identified in the root extract of white hellebore and is also found in the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum, and it is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. RSV is a natural agent that possesses great therapeutic potential for protecting against acute or chronic injury in multiple tissues as a result of its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. According to its demonstrated properties, RSV may improve the therapeutic effects of MSCs via enhancing their survival, self-renewal, lineage commitment, and anti-aging effects. In this review, we concluded that RSV significantly improved the preventive and therapeutic effects of MSCs against multiple diseases. We also described the underlying mechanisms of the effects of RSV on the survival, self-renewal, and lineage commitment of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Upon further clarification of the potential mechanisms of the effects of RSV on MSC-based therapy, MSCs may be able to be more widely used in regenerative medicine to promote recovery from tissue injury.</AbstractText>"}

Data was analyzed using Strauss and Corbin's (1998) recommended method through open, axial and selective coding. MAXQDA 2007 software was used for organizing data and managing the process of analysis. <b>Results:</b> The analysis revealed the core category of 'moving from uncertainty toward acceptance'. The interrelated categories subsumed under the core category included challenging aging, observing the symptoms of menopause, responding to the menopausal symptoms, understanding the need for preparation, and assessing the right time to prepare. <b>Conclusion:</b> Moving from uncertainty toward acceptance was identified as the core concept in the Iranian women's experiences of encountering menopause. Modifying the beliefs of people about menopause and aging as well as increasing their knowledge and information about menopause can help women to experience the menopausal transition with more ease.</AbstractText>"}

Although stiction has been proposed as a precursor to damage, there is still a lack of knowledge about its origin and its relation to the hydrogel's microstructure, which impairs the design of soft matter as replacement biomaterials. In this work, the static friction of poly(acrylamide) hydrogels with modulated composition was investigated by colloidal probe lateral force microscopy as a function of load, temperature, and loading time. Temperature-dependent studies enable to build a phase diagram for hydrogel's static friction, which explains stiction via (polymer) viscoelastic and poroelastic relaxation, and a subtle transition from solid- to liquid-like interfacial behavior. At room temperature, the static friction increases with loading time, a phenomenon called contact aging, which stems from the adhesion of the polymer to the colloid and from the drainage-induced increase in contact area. Contact aging is shown to gradually vanish with increase in temperature, but this behavior strongly depends on the hydrogel's composition. This work scrutinizes the relation between the microstructure of hydrogel-like soft matter and interfacial behavior, with implications for diverse areas of inquiry, not only in biolubrication and biomedical applications but also in soft robotics and microelectromechanical devices, where the processes occurring at the migrating hydrogel interface are of relevance. The results support that modulating both the hydrogel's mesh size and the structure of the near-surface region is a means to control static friction and adhesion. This conceptual framework for static friction will foster further understanding of the wear of hydrogel-like materials.</AbstractText>"}

'Things' with embedded activity and vital sign sensors that we refer to as 'smart stuff' can interact with wearable and ambient sensors. A dynamic, ad-hoc personal area network can span multiple domains and facilitate processing in synergistic personal area networks-SPANs. The synergy of information from multiple sensors can provide: (a) New information that cannot be generated from existing data alone, (b) user identification, (c) more robust assessment of physiological signals, and (d) automatic annotation of events/records. In this paper, we present possible new applications of SPANs and results of feasibility studies. Preliminary tests indicate that users interact with smart stuff-in our case, a smart water bottle-dozens of times a day and sufficiently long to collect vital signs of the users. Synergistic processing of sensors from the smartwatch and objects of everyday use may provide user identification and assessment of new parameters that individual sensors could not generate, such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and blood pressure. As a result, SPANs facilitate seamless monitoring and annotation of vital signs dozens of times per day, every day, every time the smart object is used, without additional setup of sensors and initiation of measurements. SPANs creates a dynamic 'opportunistic bubble' for ad-hoc integration with other sensors of interest around the user, wherever they go. Continuous long-term monitoring of user's activity and vital signs can provide better diagnostic procedures and personalized feedback to motivate a proactive approach to health and wellbeing.</AbstractText>"}

However, few studies have investigated the effects of air pollutants on human longevity, especially based on the total regional quantities and sources. Based on investigation of the spatiotemporal variations of three air pollutants (PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NOx) and three longevity indicators (centenarian ratio, centenarity index, and aging tendency), this study aims to identify the relationship between air pollution and regional longevity in Guangxi Province. Air pollutant and population data from 109 counties and areas of Guangxi were collected from environmental research reports and statistical yearbooks. Cluster and outlier analysis was used to detect the regions with high and low clusters of the longevity indicators and air pollutants. Geographically weighted regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between longevity and air pollutants. A negative relationship between the air pollutants PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NOx on the aged population was observed. From a provincial level, industrial sources from the urban areas of cities located in the central province, including Liuzhou, Nanning, Laibing, Guigang and Yulin, were important contributors to the air pollutants PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NOx, and thus could contribute to negative impacts on regional longevity. The key findings from this study will provide a case for management of air pollutants based on public health policies in China as well as other developing communities.</AbstractText>"}

With a rise in the rate of aging population worldwide, the number of people diagnosed with PAD is rapidly increasing. The micronutrient vitamin D is an important steroid hormone that acts on many crucial cellular mechanisms. Experimental studies suggest that optimal levels of vitamin D have beneficial effects on the heart and blood vessels; however, high vitamin D concentrations have been implicated in promoting vascular calcification and arterial stiffness. Observations from various clinical studies shows that deficiency of vitamin D has been associated with a greater risk of PAD. Epidemiological studies have often reported an inverse relation between circulating vitamin D status measured in terms of 25-hydroxivitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and increased cardiovascular disease risk; however, randomized controlled trials did not show a consistent positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk or events. Even though PAD shares all the major risk factors with cardiovascular diseases, the effect of vitamin D deficiency in PAD is not clear. Current evidence suggests a strong role of vitamin D in promoting genomic and epigenomic changes. This review summarises the current literature that supports the notion that vitamin D deficiency may promote PAD formation. A better understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms will open up new therapeutic possibilities which is the main unmet need in PAD management. Furthermore, epigenetic evidence shows that a more holistic approach towards PAD prevention that incorporates a healthy lifestyle, adequate exercise and optimal nutrition may be more effective in protecting the genome and maintaining a healthy vasculature.</AbstractText>"}

The increase in patient and medical costs because of global aging is recognized as a problem. Decreased bone mass is a common symptom of bone diseases such as Paget's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple myeloma. Osteoclasts, which directly affect bone mass, show a marked increase in differentiation and activation in the aforementioned diseases. Moreover, these multinucleated cells made from monocytes/macrophages under the influence of RANKL and M-CSF, are the only cells capable of resorbing bones. In this study, we found that the water extracts of Boseokchal (BSC-W) inhibited osteoclast differentiation in vitro and investigated its inhibitory mechanism. BSC-W was obtained by extracting flour of Boseokchal using hexane and water. To osteoclast differentiation, bone marrow-derived macrophage cells (BMMs) were cultured with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or BSC-W in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL for 4 days. Cytotoxicity was measured by CCK-8. Gene expression of cells was confirmed by real-time PCR. Protein expression of cells was observed by western blot assay. Bone resorption activity of osteoclast evaluated by bone pit formation assay using an Osteo Assay Plate. BSC-W inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner without exerting a cytotoxic effect on BMMs. BSC-W decreased the transcriptional and translational expression of c-Fos and NFATc1, which are regulators of osteoclastogenesis and reduced the mRNA expression level of TRAP, DC-STAMP, and cathepsin K, which are osteoclast differentiation marker. Furthermore, BSC-W reduced the resorption activity of osteoclasts. Taken together, our results indicate that BSC-W is a useful candidate for health functional foods or therapeutic agents that can help treat bone diseases such as osteoporosis.</AbstractText>"}

The importance of energy storage systems in ships, the causes and models of battery aging, types of failures, and predictive diagnosis techniques for valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries used for assisted and safe navigation are discussed. In ships, battery banks are installed in chambers that normally do not have temperature regulation and therefore are significantly conditioned by the outside temperature. A specific method based on the analysis of the time-series data of random and seasonal factors is proposed for the comparative trend analyses of both the battery internal temperature and the battery installation chamber temperature. The objective is to apply predictive fault diagnosis to detect any undesirable increase in battery temperature using prior indicators of heat dissipation process failure-to avoid the development of the most frequent and dangerous failure modes of VRLA batteries such as dry out and thermal runaway. It is concluded that these failure modes can be conveniently diagnosed by easily recognized patterns, obtained by performing comparative trend analyses to the variables measured onboard by NMEA sensors.</AbstractText>"}

There were no significant changes in the age at FN fracture in men or the age at PT fracture in women and men. Further, increases in life expectancy were considerably faster than any change observed in the age at hip fracture. In 1996, the average age at FN or PT fracture exceeded the average life expectancy in both men and women whereas the opposite was the case from 2009 and onwards in men and 2015 and onwards in women.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>This study demonstrates a significant change in the demographics of hip fractures in Denmark over the past two decades. We observed a significant increase in the age at FN fracture in women but not in men, with no significant increase in the age at IT fracture and PT fracture. This developed much more slowly, however, than the increase in life expectancy in both sexes observed over the same period of time. Taken together, these changes resulted in a large decrease in the female to male incidence rate ratio from 2.6 and 2.5 (FN and PT, respectively) to 1.9 and 1.7.Additional effort is required to prevent hip fractures to ensure that the increasing life expectancy is matched by a similar increase in hip-fracture free life expectancy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Reports of the associations of dietary protein intake with bone strength are inconsistent, possibly owing to differences in protein sources and amino acid (AA) composition. We examined the associations of serum AA with 4-year hip BMD loss and subsequent fracture risk within 10 years in older community-dwelling adults, and further addressed whether lifestyle, dietary protein intake and its source, and body composition would affect the associations. In 1424 men and 1573 women (mean age 72 years), using binary logistic regression, higher serum valine, leucine, isoleucine and tryptophan concentrations were associated (or approaching a borderline significance in case of the last three ones) with less hip BMD decline (defined as BMD loss ≥ 2.8 times the precision error of the BMD measurement at femoral neck) in 4 years later, with the OR (95%CI) /SD of AA increase, ranging from 0.83 (0.75, 0.91) to 0.92 (0.87, 0.98) after multiple adjustments for baseline age, gender, BMI, BMD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), dietary protein intake (animal- and plant-derived protein intakes), calcium intake, established lifestyles (physical activity level, smoking and alcohol drinking status), osteoporosis medications, and changes of body fat and lean muscle mass. Higher serum total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration was independently associated with BMD decline 4 years later (OR (95%CI) /SD of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27)). Using multivariate Cox regression, higher serum tryptophan concentration potentially predicted low risk of incident major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) (HR/SD (95%CI)=0.86 (0.75, 0.98)) after multiple adjustments. Higher serum tHcy was associated with MOFs (HR/SD (95%CI)=1.29 (1.12, 1.50)) risk after multiple adjustments in men. These findings suggest that a specific AA profile correlates with greater BMD and lower subsequent fracture risk, independent of diet and lifestyle factors.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to develop a dietary nutritional supplement exerting both antioxidant and anti-aging effects. Peptide, named as ERJ-CP, was prepared by mixing enzyme-treated royal jelly (ERJ) with collagen peptide (CP), showing stronger antioxidant activity in vitro. Drosophila was used as model animal to investigate anti-aging effect of ERJ-CP in vivo. ERJ-CP significantly prolonged the average life span of Drosophila treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and paraquat, reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO) levels in Drosophila. In addition, 3 mg/mL of ERJ-CP could prolong the lifespan of natural aging Drosophila by 11.16%. ERJ-CP could up-regulate the levels of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and down-regulate the contents of MDA and PCO. Moreover, the intake of ERJ-CP increased the food consumption, weight gain and exercise capacity of Drosophila. The results showed that ERJ-CP played a protective role in both antioxidant and anti-aging effects on Drosophila, and the anti-aging effect may be achieved by alleviating oxidative damage. It suggests that ERJ-CP could be developed as a health-promoting ingredient with antioxidant and anti-aging effects for human body.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In these transgenic mice, backcrossing for more than 10 generations results in replacement of the donor background (129/Sv) with that of the recipient (C57BL/6), so that approximately 99.9% of genes are C57BL/6-derived and are considered congenic. However, the regions flanking the target gene may still be of 129/Sv origin, creating a so-called 'passenger gene problem' where the normal 129/Sv-derived Cdh23<sup>753G</sup> allele can travel with the target gene. In this study, we investigated the role of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7), which is important for cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids in the cochlea, using traditional Fabp7 knockout (KO) mice on the C57BL/6 background. We found that Fabp7 KO mice showed delayed AHL progression and milder cochlear degeneration. However, the genotype of the Cdh23 region flanking Fabp7 was still that of 129/Sv origin (Cdh23<sup>753GG</sup>). Our findings reveal the potential risk of contamination for traditional transgenic mice generated on the C57BL/6 background.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

To date, the differentiation between conventional (trabecular meshwork) and unconventional (uveoscleral) pathways is widely accepted, distinguishing the different impact of the intraocular pressure on the AH outflow rate. Although the conventional route is recognized to host the main sites for intraocular pressure regulation, the unconventional pathway, with its great potential for AH resorption, seems to act as a sort of relief valve, especially when the trabecular resistance rises. Recent evidence demonstrates the presence of lymphatic channels in the eye and proposes that they may participate in the overall AH drainage and intraocular pressure regulation, in a presumably adaptive fashion. For this reason, the uveolymphatic route is increasingly thought to play an important role in the ocular hydrodynamic system physiology. As a result of the unconventional pathway characteristics, hydrodynamic disorders do not develop until the adaptive routes cannot successfully counterbalance the increased AH outflow resistance. When their adaptive mechanisms fail, glaucoma occurs. Our review deals with the standard and newly discovered AH outflow routes, with particular attention to the importance they may have in opening new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether a NF homolog exists in C. elegans remains unclear. We characterize TAG-63 as a NF-like protein with sequence homologies to human NEFH carrying various coiled coils as well as clustered phosphorylation sites. TAG-63 also exhibits features of NFL such as a molecular weight of around 70 kD, the lack of KSP repeats and the ability to form 10 nm filamentous structures in transmission electron micrographs. An anti-NEFH antibody detects a band at the predicted molecular weight of TAG-63 in Western blots of whole worm lysates and this band cannot be detected in tag-63 knockout worms. A transcriptional tag-63 reporter expresses in a broad range of neurons, and various anti-NFH antibodies stain worm neurons with an overlapping expression of axonal vesicle transporter UNC-104(KIF1A). Cultured neurons grow shorter axons when incubating with drugs known to disintegrate the NF network and rhodamine-labeled in vitro reconstituted TAG-63 filaments disintegrate upon drug exposure. Speeds of UNC-104 motors are diminished in tag-63 mutant worms with visibly increased accumulations of motors along axons. UNC-104/TAG-63 and SNB-1/TAG-63 not only colocalize in neurons but also revealed positive BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence assay) signals. In summary, we identified and characterized TAG-63 in C. elegans, and demonstrate that lack of this protein limits axonal transport efficiencies.

Drug therapy using incretin has become a new strategy for diabetic treatments due to its significant effects on improving insulin receptors and promoting insulinotropic secretion. Considering the fact that diabetes millitus is a key risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, the extensive protective roles of incretin in chronic diseases have received great attention. Based on the evidence from animal experiments, where incretin can protect against the pathophysiological processes of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical trials for the treatments of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are currently ongoing. Moreover, the protective effect of incretin on heart has been observed in cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of vessels. Meanwhile, incretin can also inhibit the proliferation of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, which can induce atherosclerogenesis. Incretin is also beneficial for diabetic microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy and gastric ulcer, as well as the hepatic-related diseases such as NAFLD and NASH. Besides, the anti-tumor properties of incretin have been proven in diverse cancers including ovarian cancer, pancreas cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Eight physically active young men (mean ± SD: age 22 ± 3 yr, height 1.77 ± 0.07 m, body mass 67.7 ± 6.2 kg) underwent two 6-h mixed-meal tolerance tests and resting vastus lateralis muscle biopsies before the first session and ≥72 h after the final session of 4 wk of HIIT [16 sessions in total; 10 × 60-s bouts of cycling at 90% maximal oxygen uptake (V̇o<sub>2max</sub>), interspersed with 60-s intervals at 45% V̇o<sub>2max</sub>]. Arterialized and deep venous blood samples from across the forearm, brachial artery blood flow measurements, and whole-body indirect calorimetry data were obtained before, and at regular intervals for 6 h after, consumption of a standardized mixed meal.

An in vitro model of exercise has been developed to better understand its molecular mechanisms. While various conditions have been used to mimic in vivo exercise, no specific conditions have matched a specific type of in vivo exercise. Here, we screened various electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) conditions and compared the molecular events under each condition in myotube culture with that obtained under voluntary wheel running (VWR), a mild endurance exercise, in mice. Both EPS and VWR upregulated the mRNA levels of genes involved in the slow-type twitch (<i>Myh7</i> and <i>Myh2</i>) and myogenesis (<i>Myod</i> and <i>Myog</i>) and increased the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. These changes were accompanied by activation of p38 and AMPK. However, neither condition induced the expression of muscle-specific E3 ligases such as MAFbx and MuRF1. Both EPS and VWR consistently induced antioxidant genes such as <i>Sod3</i> and <i>Gpx4</i> but did not cause similar changes in the expression levels of the calcium channel/pump-related genes <i>Ryr</i> and <i>Serca</i>. Furthermore, both EPS and VWR reduced glycogen levels but not lactate levels as assessed in post-EPS culture medium and post-VWR serum, respectively. Thus we identified an in vitro EPS condition that effectively mimics VWR in mice, which can facilitate further studies of the detailed molecular mechanisms of endurance exercise in the absence of interference from multiple tissues and organs.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> This study establishes an optimal condition for electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) in myotubes that shows a similar molecular signature as voluntary wheel running. The specific EPS condition <i>1</i>) upregulates the mRNA of slow-twitch muscle components and myogenic transcription factors, <i>2</i>) induces antioxidant genes without any muscle damage, and <i>3</i>) promotes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α and its upstream regulators involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

This simplified grouping is consistent with how pet owners generally perceive their dog's maturation and aging process and provides a readily understood basis for an evolving, lifelong healthcare strategy. The guidelines provide the following recommendations for managing 10 health-related factors at each of the first four canine life stages: lifestyle effect on the patient's safety, zoonotic and human safety risk, behavior, nutrition, parasite control, vaccination, dental health, reproduction, breed-specific conditions, and a baseline diagnostic profile.</b> </AbstractText>"}

These mechanisms can be altered by aging or pathological disorders. However it is almost impossible to investigate these phenomena in real-life conditions, and the safe environment of a laboratory is needed. This paper investigates how jerk perturbations in the transverse plane similar to those experienced on public transport can be simulated in a controlled manner. A platform capable of producing horizontal perturbations with a person standing on it was developed. Accuracy, repeatability, and load sensitivity of the system were assessed with repeated trials in all four directions of movement. Comparison between the destabilising effect experienced on public transport and the postural response to perturbations from the platform was also made by tracking acceleration of the centre of mass of four subjects in these two situations. Results show that balance perturbations representative of real-life situations, such as standing on public transport, can accurately and repeatedly be produced in a safe and controlled environment with a low-cost and low-maintenance system. Coupled to motion capture technology, the system can be used for pathology assessment and rehabilitation treatments.</AbstractText>"}

Implementation was evaluated using different process outcomes: reach, dosage, satisfaction, maintenance. Patients' physical activity outcomes included changes in total minutes/week of physical activity. Latent class analyses were conducted to identify profiles of received counseling characteristics and multilevel models were used to investigate associations with physical activity outcomes. <b>Results:</b> 5873 Patients were provided with motivational interviewing-based counseling after rehabilitation. Professionals and patients were positive about the program. Sixteen institutions (89%) formally agreed to continue the program. The four identified profiles of counseling characteristics illustrate a large variation in received counseling among patients. No substantial differences in physical activity outcomes were found between profiles. <b>Conclusion:</b> After a three-year program period, the physical activity counseling centers were sustainably implemented in Dutch rehabilitation care. This study illustrated an innovative approach to assess heterogeneity in implementation outcomes (e.g., counseling profiles) in relation to program outcomes (e.g., physical activity). Implications for rehabilitation Physical activity counseling after rehabilitation is important to support people with disabilities in making the step from rehabilitation-based physical activities to community-based physical activities. Establishing 'Physical Activity Counseling Centers' is a promising 'disability-overarching' strategy to promote physical activity after rehabilitation. Although the actual received counseling (dosage) varied among patients, this did not coincide with large differences in physical activity outcomes. The training in Motivational Interviewing, the financial incentives, and the advisory support were considered as important or essential ingredients for a successful implementation of the counseling program in rehabilitation practice.</AbstractText>"}

However, the impacts of sulfur dose and sulfidation time on morphology, sulfur content, reactivity, and selectivity of the resulting sulfidized NZVI (SNZVI) have not been systematically evaluated. We synthesized SNZVI using different sulfur doses and sulfidation times and measured their properties. The measured S/Fe molar ratio in the particles ([S/Fe]<sub>particle</sub>) was 10-500 times lower than [S/Fe]<sub>dosed</sub> but was predictable based on [S/Fe]<sub>dosed</sub> × <i>t</i><sub>sulfidation</sub>. The low sulfur content (0.02-0.65 mol % S/Fe) inhibited the reaction of SNZVI with water (up to 13-fold) and increased its reactivity with trichloroethene (TCE) (up to 14-fold) and its electron efficiency (up to 20-fold). A higher [S/Fe]<sub>particle</sub> (0.86-1.13 mol % S/Fe) led to complex particle structures and lowered the resistance to electron transfer but did not improve the benefits realized at the lower S/Fe ratios. Adding small amounts of sulfur into NZVI led to more accumulation of acetylene, especially for low Fe/TCE conditions, suggesting that sulfur lowers the rate of hydrogenation of acetylene to ethene. These results show that [S/Fe]<sub>dosed</sub> × <i>t</i><sub>sulfidation</sub> can be used to predict the measured S content in the particles and that affects reactivity, longevity, and electron selectivity, for post-SNZVI.</AbstractText>"}

Long considered to be a 'wear and tear' disease, OA is now seen as a low-grade inflammation disease that affects all tissues of the joint, involving cartilage degradation, bone remodelling, osteophytes, and synovitis. The process, called inflammaging, is characterised by the association of low-grade inflammation, profound changes in intra-cellular mechanisms, and the decreased efficiency of the immune system with ageing. The activation of innate immunity plays a critical role in the development and progression of OA. Innate immunity, including inflammasome activation, is triggered by small endogenous molecules called alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules are released in the extracellular media after cell stress or damage, bind to pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and activate the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, leading to joint inflammation. Moreover, such sterile inflammation triggers cell senescence, characterised by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Understanding the substantial age-related changes of joint tissues that influence the pathogenesis of OA is critical to improving the quality of life of elderly people in the context of increased life expectancy. This review will focus on age-related sterile inflammation in OA and highlight the various innovative and promising therapies targeting the mechanisms of aging.</AbstractText>"}

Synovitis increases the risk of OA onset and progression and involves the recruitment of monocytes, lymphocytes, and other leukocytes. In particular, macrophages are important mediators of synovial inflammatory activity and pathologic cartilage and bone responses that are characteristic of OA. Advances in understanding how damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) trigger monocyte/macrophage recruitment and activation in joints provide opportunities for disease-modifying therapies. However, the complexity and plasticity of macrophage phenotypes that exist in vivo have thus far prevented the successful development of macrophage-targeted treatments. Current studies show that synovial macrophages are derived from distinct cellular lineages, which correspond to unique functional roles for maintaining joint homeostasis. An improved understanding of the aetiology of synovial inflammation in specific OA-subtypes, such as with obesity or genetic risk, is a potential strategy for developing patient selection criteria for future precision therapies.</AbstractText>"}

Based on a sample of 3,955 adults aged over 50 years, we investigated the role of age, cognitive status, and sex on susceptibility to the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI) as a measure of audiovisual temporal integration, while controlling for a range of covariates. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian, ordinal-regression model to determine which variables predicted audiovisual integration. Higher susceptibility to the SIFI was predicted by older age, female sex (at larger temporal asynchronies), and a lower score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our results confirm, in a population-representative sample, that enhanced audiovisual integration is associated with ageing and extend the association between multisensory integration and mild cognitive impairment to global cognitive status. Importantly, the findings also highlight the role of the sex of the participant as a previously overlooked factor in studying multisensory perception in ageing.

However, it has potential biological toxicity. In this study, the classical model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, was used to explore underlying mechanism for the toxic effects of silver nanoparticle. The pupation rate, eclosion time, eclosion rate and lifespan of Oregon R, w1118, and MTF mutants under different concentrations of silver nanoparticle were measured. The lacZ activity of rpr-lacZ strain was used to determine apoptosis of imaginal disc after treated with different concentrations of silver nanoparticle. The difference of intestinal protein expression in MTF mutants treated with different concentrations of silver nanoparticle was studied by SDS-PAGE. The amino acid sequence of differential proteins was further analyzed by mass spectrometry. The results showed that pupation rate and eclosion rate of MTF mutants significantly decreased when the concentration of silver nanoparticle increased to 200 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> and above. When the concentration of silver nanoparticle increased to 800 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup>, the rate of pupation and eclosion was significantly reduced, with the time of pupation and eclosion being not correlated to the concentration of silver nanoparticle. The concentrations of silver nanoparticle had no effect on the lifespan of Oregon R and w1118, while 200 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> silver nanoparticle significantly reduced the average lifespan of MTF mutant. Apoptosis increased with increasing concentration of silver nanoparticle. Results from SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis showed that the expression levels of proteins such as ATP kinase, heat shock protein and glucose metabolism related enzymes increased with increasing concentration of silver nanoparticle. Our results showed that high concentration of silver nanoparticle would reduce the survival rate of Drosophila, promote apoptosis and the expression of some proteins, which provided a theoretical basis for further understanding of the toxic mechanism of silver nanoparticle.</AbstractText>"}

All participants performed saliva swallowing five times at 5 s intervals in three conditions (without KT, 50% stretch with KT, and 80% stretch with KT). KT in the I and reverse V shapes was pulled vertically from the hyolaryngeal complex to the sternum and medially from the superior surface of the clavicle, respectively. Another KT horizontally covered the hyolaryngeal complex to enhance the movement restriction of the hyolaryngeal complex during swallowing. Activation of the suprahyoid muscles during swallowing in the two conditions was measured using surface electromyography. In addition, a 0-10 numerical rating self-report scale was used to evaluate the required effort and the resistance felt during swallowing. Both KT 50% and 80% were significantly higher in surface electromyography (sEMG) mean value, peak value, required effort, and resistance felt during swallowing compared to normal swallowing (p &lt; 0.05).

Lysine, proline, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine concentrations were higher in infants with a linear growth velocity <i>z</i>-score &gt;0 than those &lt;0. Corrected Spearman correlation coefficients between individual AA concentrations and weight-for-height and length velocity from 6 to 12 mo of age were positively correlated for glycine, isoleucine, proline, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and valine. Additionally, weight-for-height was correlated with arginine, asparagine, glutamine, leucine, lysine, methionine, and phenylalanine.

These are discussed with respect to their ameliorative or deleterious effects. These effects are measured <i>in vivo</i> in animal models as well as <i>in vitro</i> in cell cultures. Evidence was found to suggest that astrocytes play a key role in stroke by expressing PTX3, which, in turn, enhances endothelial tightness, increases tight junction proteins, and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor. The role of astrocytes and PTX3 is examined in relation to hypoxic stress and conditioning as well as mitochondrial transfer.

Recent evidence has shown a significant connection between gut microbiota and brain function, as butyrate production by microorganisms is believed to activate the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To investigate whether modification of intestinal microbiota could impact cognitive decline in the aging brain, Romo-Araiza <i>et al</i>. conducted a study to test how probiotic and prebiotic supplementation impacted spatial and associative memory in middle-aged rats. Their results showed that rats supplemented with the symbiotic (both probiotic and prebiotic) treatment performed significantly better than other groups in the spatial memory test, though not in that of associative memory. Their data also reported that this improvement correlated with increased levels of BDNF, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and better electrophysiological outcomes in the hippocampi of the symbiotic group. Thus, the results indicated that the progression of cognitive impairment is indeed affected by changes in microbiota induced by probiotics and prebiotics. Potential future applications of these findings center around combatting neurodegeneration and inflammation associated not only with aging but also with the damaging posttraumatic effects of ischemic stroke.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Due to the unique aspect of ischemic strokes, finding approaches to maintain the vigor of the cerebral vasculature, such as increased angiogenesis, may protect against stroke. Ischemic strokes are caused by disruptions in blood movement in the brain, resulting in a torrent of harmful cerebrovasculature modifications. In an investigation by Pianta <i>et al</i>., Sprague-Dawley rats have been separated into those that undergo exercise prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and those that were not exposed to physical activity preceding MCAO. The outcomes and results of the current study gave new insights into the capacity of exercise to help prevent ischemic strokes or mitigate poststroke effects. The data collected from the study suggested that rats that went through a short bout of exercise before MCAO presented superior motor performance, more active cells in the peri-infarct region, and reduced infarct sizes. When compared to the control group, the rats that went through exercise also had heightened angiogenesis and improved neuroprotection. Thus, a brief bout of physical activity preceding a stroke may provide neuroprotection by enhancing the strength of the cerebrovasculature in the brain. This notion that even an instant of physical exercise before a stroke is induced can help dampen the effects of ischemic stroke, which could lead to future techniques in preventing the ischemic stroke so that it never happens at all.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Molecular mechanisms behind these defects and the cell-intrinsic (affecting naïve CD8 T cells themselves) vs. extrinsic, microenvironmental origin of such defects remain unclear. Using reciprocal transfer experiments of highly purified naïve T cells from adult and old transgenic OT-1 mice, we decisively show that the dominant effect is cell-extrinsic. Naïve adult OT-1 T cells failed to expand and terminally differentiate in the old organism infected with <i>Listeria</i>-OVA. This defect was preceded by blunted expression of the master transcription factor T-bet and impaired glycolytic switch when T cells are primed in the old organism. However, both old and adult naïve CD8 T cells proliferated and produced effector molecules to a similar extent when stimulated <i>in vitro</i> with polyclonal stimuli, as well as when transferred into adult recipients. Multiple inflammatory cytokines with direct effects on T cell effector differentiation were decreased in spleens of old animals, particularly IL-12 and IL-18. Of note, <i>in vivo</i> treatment of mice with IL-12 and IL-18 on days 4-6 of <i>Listeria</i> infection reconstituted cytotoxic T cell response of aged mice to the level of adult. Therefore, critical cytokine signals which are underproduced in the old priming environment can restore proper transcriptional programming of old naïve CD8 T cells and improve immune defense against intracellular microorganisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Jergović, Thompson, Renkema, Smithey and Nikolich-Žugich.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, little is known about the EEG correlates of DR in elderly people. Only an investigation found differences between recall and non-recall conditions during NREM sleep EEG in older adults, while-surprisingly-no EEG predictor of DR was found for what concerns REM sleep. Considering REM sleep as a privileged <i>scenario</i> to produce mental sleep activity related to cognitive processes, our study aimed to investigate whether specific EEG topography and frequency changes during REM sleep in elderly people may predict a subsequent recall of mental sleep activity. Twenty-one healthy older volunteers (mean age 69.2 ± 6.07 SD) and 20 young adults (mean age 23.4 ± 2.76 SD) were recorded for one night from 19 scalp derivations. Dreams were collected upon morning awakenings from REM sleep. EEG signals of the last 5 min were analyzed by the Better OSCillation algorithm to detect the peaks of oscillatory activity in both groups. Statistical comparisons revealed that older as well as young individuals recall their dream experience when the last segment of REM sleep is characterized by frontal theta oscillations. No Recall (Recall vs. Non-Recall) × Age (Young vs. Older) interaction was found. This result replicated the previous evidence in healthy young subjects, as shown in within- and between-subjects design. The findings are completely original for older individuals, demonstrating that theta oscillations are crucial for the retrieval of dreaming also in this population. Furthermore, our results did not confirm a greater presence of the theta activity in healthy aging. Conversely, we found a greater amount of rhythmic theta and alpha activity in young than older participants. It is worth noting that the theta oscillations detected are related to cognitive functioning. We emphasize the notion that the oscillatory theta activity should be distinguished from the non-rhythmic theta activity identified in relation to other phenomena such as (a) sleepiness and hypoarousal conditions during the waking state and (b) cortical slowing, considered as an EEG alteration in clinical samples.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Scarpelli, D'Atri, Bartolacci, Mangiaruga, Gorgoni and De Gennaro.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Using PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review evaluated the available evidence regarding the transfer of motor skills from VE training to real-world sporting contexts. The initial search identified 448 articles, but only 4 of these articles met basic criteria necessary to assess real-world transfer. Key factors regarding the study design, learner characteristics and training environment of these studies are considered. In a relatively new area of research, the findings from these 4 articles are encouraging and provide initial support for the notion that skills training in a VE can improve real-world performance in sports. However, for a wider uptake of VEs in sports training, it is important that more research demonstrates real-world transfer.

From a perspective centered on physiology and integration, biological systems are often characterized as organized in such a way that they realize metabolic self-production and self-maintenance. The existence and activity of their components rely on the network they realize and on the continuous management of the exchange of matter and energy with their environment. One of the virtues of the organismic approach focused on organization is that it can provide an understanding of how biological systems are functionally integrated into coherent wholes. Organismic frameworks have been primarily developed by focusing on unicellular life. Multicellularity, however, presents additional challenges to our understanding of biological systems, related to how cells are capable to live together in higher-order entities, in such a way that some of their features and behaviors are constrained and controlled by the system they realize. Whereas most accounts of multicellularity focus on cell differentiation and increase in size as the main elements to understand biological systems at this level of organization, we argue that these factors are insufficient to provide an understanding of how cells are physically and functionally integrated in a coherent system. In this paper, we provide a new theoretical framework to understand multicellularity, capable to overcome these issues. Our thesis is that one of the fundamental theoretical principles to understand multicellularity, which is missing or underdeveloped in current accounts, is the functional organization of the intercellular space. In our view, the capability to be organized in space plays a central role in this context, as it enables (and allows to exploit all the implications of) cell differentiation and increase in size, and even specialized functions such as immunity. We argue that the extracellular matrix plays a crucial active role in this respect, as an evolutionary ancient and specific (non-cellular) control subsystem that contributes as a key actor to the functional specification of the multicellular space and to modulate cell fate and behavior.

Due to the high abundance of polyphenols, its oral liquid is unstable and easy to cause precipitate, which results in the loss of activities. However, complex composition and unclear precipitation mechanism hinders the improvement of stability. In this study, the accumulation of precipitation in the storage and its effect on activity were investigated. Then, an integrated chain of evidence was proposed based on the physical phase, chemical profile, and sediment elements. The results showed that antioxidant activity decreased from <i>IC<sub>50</sub></i> 115 to 146 μl before and after 90 days of storage, and the anti-fatigue activity decreased from 30.54 to 28.47 min. Turbiscan Lab Expert observed that particle size increased from 106 to 122 nm, and the turbiscan stability index increased from 0 to 14, which indicated that its stability is continuously decreasing. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint coupled with multivariate statistical analysis identified that these chemical markers changed significantly, such as gallic acid, catechins, and ellagic acid. Loss of catechins tends to be involved in the formation of phlobaphene precipitation. The fact that the new-born ellagic acid in precipitation (0.47 mg/ml) is significantly higher than that reduced in solution (0.25 mg/ml) indicates that it is not only derived from colloid aging. Microscopic observation combined with energy spectrum analysis further confirmed the existence of the multi-precipitates. The crystalline precipitate is ellagic acid, and the other is phlobaphene. In conclusion, based on the evidence chain analysis, this study revealed a systematic change of the whole polyphenol solution system. It provides a novel perspective to understand the sedimentation formation of polyphenol solution, which is an important theoretical contribution to the preparation of polyphenol solutions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Huang, Feng, Lin, Zhao, Ma, Liu, Fan, Wu, Xu, Han and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Cellular molecular chaperone systems modulate proteostasis, and, therefore, are primed to influence aberrant protein-induced neurotoxicity and disease progression. Molecular chaperones have a wide range of functions from facilitating proper nascent folding and refolding to degradation or sequestration of misfolded substrates. In disease states, molecular chaperones can display protective or aberrant effects, including the promotion and stabilization of toxic protein aggregates. This seems to be dependent on the aggregating protein and discrete chaperone interaction. Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a class of molecular chaperones that typically associate early with misfolded proteins. These interactions hold proteins in a reversible state that helps facilitate refolding or degradation by other chaperones and co-factors. These sHsp interactions require dynamic oligomerization state changes in response to diverse cellular triggers and, unlike later steps in the chaperone cascade of events, are ATP-independent. Here, we review evidence for modulation of neurodegenerative disease-relevant protein aggregation by sHsps. This includes data supporting direct physical interactions and potential roles of sHsps in the stewardship of pathological protein aggregates in brain. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of sHsp chaperone activity may help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to modulate the aggregation of pathological, amyloidogenic proteins. sHsps-targeting strategies including modulators of expression or post-translational modification of endogenous sHsps, small molecules targeted to sHsp domains, and delivery of engineered molecular chaperones, are also discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Webster, Darling, Uversky and Blair.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Regarding neurological aspects, executive functions have been shown to be valuable for daily life and to slow decline during aging. Most intervention studies intended to improve cognitive functions during aging specifically address long-term destructive processes and countermeasures. However, to an increasing degree, studies also investigate the acute benefits that prove to be useful for daily life, such as physical exercise or video games in the form of exercise video gaming ('exergaming'). Because little is known about the change in cognitive ability following acute intervention of a combination of physical exercise and video gaming, especially for older people, this work is designed as an attempt to address this matter. <b>Methods</b>: This study is a randomized crossover controlled trial to test the response to an acute bout of high-intensity physical exercise followed by a short session with a brain training (Brain Age) video game in physically active and cognitively healthy older adults (60-70 years). The response is measured using Stroop task performance (cognitive task for executive function) and related brain activity assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The control conditions are low-intensity physical exercise and Tetris for video gaming. <b>Discussion</b>: This study is intended to provide insight into the alteration of executive function and its related brain activity from an acute intervention with a combination of physical exercise and video gaming in older people. The protocol might not be implementable in daily life to improve cognitive abilities. However, the results can support future studies that investigate cognition and the combination of physical exercise and video gaming.

However, as a protein with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), tau also interacts with many other partners in addition to microtubules. Phosphorylation at selected sites modulates tau's various intracellular interactions and regulates the properties of IDRs. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, tau exhibits pathologically increased phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation) at selected sites and aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). By bioinformatics means, we tested the hypothesis that the sequence of tau has changed during the vertebrate evolution in a way that novel interactions developed and also the phosphorylation pattern was affected, which made tau prone to the development of tauopathies. We report that distinct regions of tau show functional specialization in their molecular interactions. We found that tau's amino-terminal region, which is involved in biological processes related to 'membrane organization' and 'regulation of apoptosis,' exhibited a strong evolutionary increase in protein disorder providing the basis for the development of novel interactions. We observed that the predicted phosphorylation sites have changed during evolution in a region-specific manner, and in some cases the overall number of phosphorylation sites increased owing to the formation of clusters of phosphorylatable residues. In contrast, disease-specific hyperphosphorylated sites remained highly conserved. The data indicate that novel, non-microtubule related tau interactions developed during evolution and suggest that the biological processes, which are mediated by these interactions, are of pathological relevance. Furthermore, the data indicate that predicted phosphorylation sites in some regions of tau, including a cluster of phosphorylatable residues in the alternatively spliced exon 2, have changed during evolution. In view of the 'antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis' it may be worth to take disease-associated phosphosites with low evolutionary conservation as relevant biomarkers into consideration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Trushina, Bakota, Mulkidjanian and Brandt.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study aims to investigate the effect of high frequency-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in aged mice and explore its underlying mechanisms. Forty-five male Kunming mice (15 months old) were randomly divided into three groups: aged sham, 5 Hz rTMS, and 25 Hz rTMS. Two sessions of 5 Hz or 25 Hz rTMS comprising 1,000 pulses in 10 trains were delivered once a day for 14 consecutive days. The aged sham group was treated by the reverse side of the coil. In the adult sham group, 15 male Kunming mice (3 months old) were treated the same way as the aged sham group. A Morris water maze (MWM) was conducted following the stimulation, and synaptic ultrastructure was observed through a transmission electron microscope. HF-rTMS improved spatial learning and memory impairment in the aged mice, and 5 Hz was more significant than 25 Hz. Synaptic plasticity-associated gene profiles were modified by HF-rTMS, especially neurotrophin signaling pathways and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) cofactors. Compared to the aged sham group, synaptic plasticity-associated proteins, i.e., synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 were increased; brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) significantly increased after the 5 Hz HF-rTMS treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that HF-rTMS ameliorated cognitive deficits in naturally aged mice. The 5 Hz rTMS treatment significantly enhanced synaptic structural plasticity and activated the BDNF/CREB pathway in the hippocampus.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ma, Geng, Wang, Han, Wang, Li, Wang and Wang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We applied graph theoretical measures to identify significant differences in functional connectivity between the individual and interactive juggling conditions. Connectivity was measured in multiple juggler pairs with various skill levels where dyads were either skill-level matched or skill-level unmatched. We observed that global efficiency was reduced during paired juggling for less skilled jugglers and increased for more skilled jugglers. When jugglers were skill-level matched, additional reductions were found in the mean clustering coefficient and small-world topology during interactive juggling. A significant difference in hemispheric brain lateralization was detected between skill-level matched and skill-level unmatched jugglers during interactive juggling: matched jugglers had an increased right hemisphere lateralization while unmatched jugglers had an increased left hemisphere lateralization.

Herein, a vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor-2 (VIPR2) peptide agonist, LBT-3627, was developed as a neuroprotectant for PD-associated dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Employing both 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and α-synuclein (α-Syn) overexpression models in rats, the sequential administration of LBT-3627 increased Treg activity without altering cell numbers both in naïve animals and during progressive nigrostriatal degeneration. LBT-3627 administration was linked to reductions of inflammatory microglia, increased survival of dopaminergic neurons, and improved striatal densities. While α-Syn overexpression resulted in reduced Treg activity, LBT-3627 rescued these functional deficits. This occurred in a dose-dependent manner closely mimicking neuroprotection. Taken together, these data provide the basis for the use of VIPR2 agonists as potent therapeutic immune modulating agents to restore Treg activity, attenuate neuroinflammation, and interdict dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.

Besides the well-known reduction in the rate of neuronal generation, development of new neurons is largely delayed in the aging brain. We have recently shown that this slow development is accelerated when middle-aged mice perform voluntary exercise in a running wheel. It is unclear whether the effects of exercise on neurogenic plasticity are persistent in time in a manner that might influence neuronal cohorts generated over an extended time span. To clarify these issues, we examined the effects of exercise length in 3-week-old neurons and found that their development is accelerated only when running occurs for long (3-4 weeks) but not short periods (1 week). Furthermore, chronic running acted with similar efficiency on neurons that were born at the onset, within, or at the end of the exercise period, lasting until 3 months. Interestingly, no effects were observed on neurons born 1 month after exercise had ended. Our results indicate that multiple neuronal cohorts born throughout the exercise span integrate very rapidly in the aging brain, such that the effects of running will accumulate and expand network assembly promoted by neurogenesis. These networks are likely to be more complex than those assembled in a sedentary mouse due to the faster and more efficient integration of new neurons.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Trinchero, Herrero and Schinder.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Dry electrode systems may contribute to rapid and repetitive mobile EEG acquisition with significantly reduced preparation time, reduced cleaning requirements, and possible self-application by the volunteer but are known for higher channel failure probability and increased sensitivity to movement artifacts. We performed a counterbalanced repeated measure endurance cycling study to objectively validate the performance and applicability of a novel commercially available 64-channel dry electrode cap for sport science. A total of 17 healthy volunteers participated in the study, performing an endurance cycling paradigm comprising five phases: (I) baseline EEG, (II) pre-cycling EEG, (III) endurance cycling, (IV) active recovery, and (V) passive recovery. We compared the performance of the 64-channel dry electrode cap with a commercial gel-based cap system in terms of usability metrics, reliability, and signal characteristics. Furthermore, we validated the performance of the dry cap during a realistic sport science investigation, verifying the hypothesis of a systematic, reproducible shift of the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) induced by physical effort.

Here we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex that is characterized by downregulation of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neural excitation increases with age and inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical activity and neuronal excitability during ageing. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and reduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants. In wild-type worms, overexpression of spr-4 suppresses excitation and extends lifespan. REST, SPR-3, SPR-4 and reduced excitation activate the longevity-associated transcription factors FOXO1 and DAF-16 in mammals and worms, respectively. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism of ageing that is mediated by neural circuit activity and regulated by REST.</AbstractText>"}

The ACMC induced an adaptive change of cortical activities throughout an extensive cortical area. In a targeted manner, modulating high-gamma activity became localized around an arbitrarily-selected cortical site controlling stimulation to the muscles.

Recently, we conducted a study using senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice to examine the effects of a carbohydrate-restricted diet on aging and skin senescence, and to determine the effect of long-term carbohydrate restriction on the aging process in mice. Here, we discuss the safety of long-term carbohydrate restriction based on the findings obtained from animal studies.</AbstractText>"}

Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world population and important nutritional source of not only carbohydrate but also protein. In recent aging societies, protein-energy malnutrition in elderly people emerges also as a social issue. Malnutrition in elderly people raises the risk of falling into age-related chronic diseases. Nutritional care can prevent elderly people from such age-related diseases. Rice and rice flour would be good foodstuff for preparation of diet suitable for and preferred by elderly people. Protein content of rice grains, like the other cereal grains, is less than 10% by weight, which is a little lower than meat and cheese, but higher than dairy milk and yoghurt. Nutritional quality of rice proteins is higher than the other cereal grains. Such relatively higher nutritional quality of rice proteins could be due to high copies of glutelin genes evolved from an ancestral gene common to soybean glycinin and resultant high content of legume-type seed storage proteins. Recently, rice flour became to be utilized for various processed food. The rice seed proteins as well as starch are accumulated in specific organelles termed protein bodies and amyloplast in the cells of endosperm and aleurone layer. By milling rice grains to flour particles consisting of protein and starch nanoparticles, processing characteristics of rice starch and proteins could be changed. To develop rice-based processed food for prevention of malnutrition, rice flour particles from various different rice sources could be blended for desired nutritional composition without spoiling the value of product food.</AbstractText>"}

Melatonin and its receptors are expressed in human granulosa cells, and have been shown to influence basal P4 production. However, previous studies addressing the regulation of StAR expression by melatonin and its impact on P4 secretion yielded contradictory results. Here, we demonstrate that melatonin upregulates StAR expression in primary cultures of human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells obtained from women undergoing <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF). Using pharmacological inhibitors, we show that the stimulatory effect of melatonin on StAR expression is mediated via both MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors. Melatonin exposure activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and its inhibition attenuates the stimulatory effect of melatonin on StAR expression. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of StAR abolishes melatonin-induced P4 production. Importantly, clinical analyses demonstrate that melatonin levels in human follicular fluid are positively correlated with P4 levels in serum. By illustrating the potential physiological role of melatonin in the regulation of StAR expression and P4 production in hGL cells, our results may serve to improve current strategies used to treat clinical infertility.</AbstractText>"}

Although long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been identified to play important roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases, the regulatory function of lncRNA MALAT1 in hypertension remains poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the role of lncRNA MALAT1 in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). LncRNA MALAT1 was determined to be elevated and MyoD to be reduced in myocardial tissues and thoracic aortic vascular tissues of SHRs. Over-expression of lncRNA MALAT1 caused severe myocardial fibrosis in SHRs. In addition, lncRNA MALAT1 over-expression <i>in vitro</i> enhanced arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) activity and fibrosis of SHRs, which, was rescued by over-expressed MyoD. Furthermore, lncRNA MALAT1 transcripts were found to be highly enriched in the nucleus, and lncRNA MALAT1 suppressed the transactivation of MyoD. Moreover, lncRNA MALAT1 was found to recruit Suv39h1 to MyoD-binding loci, leading to H3K9me3 trimethylation and down-regulation of the target gene. Taken conjointly, this study revealed an important role of lncRNA MALAT1 in promoting cardiac remodeling in hypertensive rats by inhibiting the transcription of MyoD. These results highlight the value of lncRNA MALAT1 as a therapeutic target for the management of hypertension.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we model how proteostasis-i.e., the folding, chaperoning, and maintenance of protein function-collapses with age from slowed translation and cumulative oxidative damage. Irreparably damaged proteins accumulate with age, increasingly distracting the chaperones from folding the healthy proteins the cell needs. The tipping point to death occurs when replenishing good proteins no longer keeps up with depletion from misfolding, aggregation, and damage. The model agrees with experiments in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> that show the following: Life span shortens nonlinearly with increased temperature or added oxidant concentration, and life span increases in mutants having more chaperones or proteasomes. It predicts observed increases in cellular oxidative damage with age and provides a mechanism for the Gompertz-like rise in mortality observed in humans and other organisms. Overall, the model shows how the instability of proteins sets the rate at which damage accumulates with age and upends a cell's normal proteostasis balance.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 16 (SCAR16) is caused by coding mutations in STUB1, a gene that encodes the multifunctional enzyme CHIP (C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein). The disease spectrum of SCAR16 includes a varying age of disease onset, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and hypogonadism. Although SCAR16 mutations span the multiple functional domains of CHIP, it is unclear whether the location of the mutation and the change in the biochemical properties of CHIP contributes to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. In this study, we examined relationships between the clinical phenotypes of SCAR16 patients and the changes in biophysical, biochemical, and functional properties of the corresponding mutated protein. We found that the severity of ataxia did not correlate with age of onset; however, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and ancestry were able to predict 54% of the variation in ataxia severity. We further identified domain-specific relationships between biochemical changes in CHIP and clinical phenotypes and specific biochemical activities that associate selectively with either increased tendon reflex or cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that specific changes to CHIP-HSC70 dynamics contribute to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. Finally, linear models of SCAR16 as a function of the biochemical properties of CHIP support the concept that further inhibiting mutant CHIP activity lessens disease severity and may be useful in the design of patient-specific targeted approaches to treat SCAR16.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Madrigal et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In neurons, the mitochondrion is an essential organelle for metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, mitochondria are extremely dynamic and able to divide, fuse, and move along microtubule tracks to ensure their distribution to the neuronal periphery. Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial dynamics are observed in a wide range of conditions, from impaired neuronal development to various neurodegenerative diseases. Novel imaging techniques and genetic tools provide unprecedented access to the physiological roles of mitochondria by visualizing mitochondrial trafficking, morphological dynamics, ATP generation, and ultrastructure. Recent studies using these new techniques have unveiled the influence of mitochondria on axon branching, synaptic function, calcium regulation with the ER, glial cell function, neurogenesis, and neuronal repair.

During the metamorphosis, cell transdifferentiation occurs. The cyst represents the intermediate stage between a reverting medusa and a healthy polyp, during which cell transdifferentiation and tissue reorganization take place. Here we characterize and compare the transcriptomes of the polyp and newborn medusa stages of <i>T. dohrnii</i> with that of the cyst, to identify biological networks potentially involved in the reverse development and transdifferentiation processes.

In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3A or UPF1 depletion in human cells. Our bioinformatics analyses allow to delineate the features of the transcripts controlled by eRF3A and UPF1 and to compare the effect of each of these factors on gene expression.

We show that eRF3A depletion globally derepresses the expression of mRNAs containing translated uORFs while UPF1 knockdown derepresses only the mRNAs harbouring uORFs with an AUG codon in an optimal context for translation initiation. Finally, we also find that eRF3A and UPF1 have opposite effects on ribosome protein gene expression. Together, our results provide important elements for understanding the impact of translation termination and NMD on the human transcriptome and reveal novel determinants of ribosome biogenesis regulation.</AbstractText>"}

Several other major risk factors for AD are strongly associated with metabolism and include lack of exercise, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, over-consumption of alcohol and depression in addition to low educational level, social isolation, and cognitive inactivity. Approaches for Alzheimer prevention and treatment through manipulation of metabolism and utilization of active metabolites have great potential either as a primary or secondary treatment avenue or as a preventative strategy in high-risk individuals. <b>Areas covered</b>: This review outlines the current knowledge concerning the relationship between AD and metabolism and the novel treatments attempting to correct changes in AD patients determined through metabolomics or lipidomic analyses. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Metabolites are one of the main driving factors and indicators of AD and can offer many possible avenues for prevention and treatment. However, with the highly interconnected effects of metabolites and metabolism, as well as the many different routes for metabolism dysfunction, successful treatment would have to include the correction of metabolic errors as well as errors in transport and metabolite processing in order to affect and revert AD progression.</AbstractText>"}

This leads to reduced quality of life, faster decline in physical health and increased health/social care use. Available treatments are commonly not tailored to people with frailty. We explored frail older peoples' experiences of depression and/or anxiety and how services could be adapted to their needs. <b>Methods:</b> Semi-structured interviews with 28 older people in the UK purposively sampled for practice location and severity of frailty and anxiety/depression. We asked about symptoms, interactions with physical health, help-seeking, treatments and what might help in future. We audio-recorded and transcribed interviews, using thematic analysis to inductively derive themes. <b>Results:</b> Frail older people had low expectations of their wellbeing at this point in life due to multiple physical health issues and so anxiety and mild depressive symptoms were normalised. There was a particular reluctance and uncertainty regarding help-seeking for anxiety. Treatments were considered appropriate where they aligned with coping skills developed over their lifetime, and facilitated independence and problem-solving skills. Most older people felt their knowledge of mental health was limited and relied upon information about and endorsement of therapies from an expert. This was usually their GP, but access was often problematic. Online methods of accessing information and therapies were not popular. <b>Conclusion:</b> Mental health support for frail older people needs to address late-life anxieties as well as depression, account for physical health issues, align with older people's need for independence and facilitate coping skills.</AbstractText>"}

Health professionals (N = 106) participated in a multicentre pre-post intervention study in Italy, the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. The 8-hour training-intervention involved health literacy knowledge, the practice of comprehensible communication skills, shared decision-making, and enhancing self-management. Self-rated health literacy competencies and training satisfaction were assessed at baseline, immediately after training and 6-12 weeks later, and analysed by multi-level analysis. Professionals' self-rated health literacy competencies significantly improved following training in all three countries; this increase persisted at 6-12 weeks follow-up. The strongest increase regarded professional's skills to enhance shared-decision making and enabling self-management after training and follow-up respectively. Professionals perceived the training as relevant for practice. Competency increases seemed to be consistent across countries. In three countries, professionals' self-rated health literacy competencies increased following this comprehensive training. These promising findings should be confirmed in a further full effect study. Implementation of this training in European education and health care may improve person-centred communication by professionals and might help to tackle health literacy related problems and to strengthen people's abilities in achieving better health outcomes.</AbstractText>"}

The course of the diseases may be influenced by germline predispositions, modifying mutations, their order of acquisition and environmental factors such as aging and inflammation. Deciphering these contributory elements, their mutual interrelationships, and their contribution to MPN pathogenesis brings important insights into the diseases. Animal models (mainly mouse and zebrafish) have already significantly contributed to understanding the role of several acquired and germline mutations in MPN oncogenic signaling.

A cohort of microtubule-associated proteins orchestrates spindle microtubule formation in a spatiotemporally coordinated manner. Among them, the conserved XMAP215/TOG family of microtubule polymerase plays a central role in spindle assembly. In fission yeast, two XMAP215/TOG members, Alp14 and Dis1, share essential roles in cell viability; however how these two proteins functionally collaborate remains undetermined. Here we show the functional interplay and specification of Alp14 and Dis1. Creation of new mutant alleles of <i>alp14</i>, which display temperature sensitivity in the absence of Dis1, enabled us to conduct detailed analyses of a double mutant. We have found that simultaneous inactivation of Alp14 and Dis1 results in early mitotic arrest with very short, fragile spindles. Intriguingly, these cells often undergo spindle collapse, leading to a lethal 'cut' phenotype. By implementing an artificial targeting system, we have shown that Alp14 and Dis1 are not functionally exchangeable and as such are not merely redundant paralogues. Interestingly, while Alp14 promotes microtubule nucleation, Dis1 does not. Our results uncover that the intrinsic specification, not the spatial regulation, between Alp14 and Dis1 underlies the collaborative actions of these two XMAP215/TOG members in mitotic progression, spindle integrity and genome stability.</AbstractText>"}

NlInR1 is strikingly homologous to the typical InR in insects and vertebrates, containing a ligand-activated intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. Herein, we report an optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the NlInR1 locus in BPH, consisting of a Cas9 plasmid that is specifically expressed in the germline via the Nlvasa promoter and versatile sgRNA expression plasmids under the control of the U6 promoter. We systematically evaluated the efficiency of injection mix compositions and demonstrated an appropriate combination of Cas9/sgRNA to target essential genes. Furthermore, we showed that homozygous mutants for the NlInR1 gene are early embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygous mutants grow more slowly, exhibit a severe reduction in body weight and wing size and live longer than the wild type. Interestingly, the severity of the mutant phenotype was different when targeting distinct important domains of the NlInR1 locus. The severity of the mutant phenotype is similar to that of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway deficiencies in vertebrates, suggesting a conserved function of NlInR1 in the regulation of development and longevity. Global expression profiling suggests that NlInR1 regulates many cellular processes in BPH, including insulin resistance, phototransduction, metabolism, endocytosis, longevity, biosynthesis and protein processing. Our results also pave the way for understanding the precise molecular mechanism of insulin signaling in wing polyphenism in insects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At baseline, mean ± SD age was 80.9 ± 4.2 and 82.6 ± 4.2 years in women (n = 148) and men (n = 150), respectively. Mean baseline BMAT was 55.4% ± 8.1% in women and 54.1% ± 8.2% in men. Incident clinical fractures occurred in 7.4% of women over 2.8 years and in 6.0% of men over 2.2 years. Incident vertebral fractures occurred in 12% of women over 3.3 years and in 17% of men over 2.7 years. Each 1 SD increase in baseline BMAT was associated with a 3.9 mg<sup>2</sup> /cm<sup>4</sup> /year greater loss of spine compressive strength index (p value = .003), a 0.9 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> /year greater loss of spine trabecular BMD (p value = .02), and a 1.2 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> /year greater loss of femoral neck trabecular BMD (p value = .02) in women. Among men, there were no associations between BMAT and changes in bone density/strength. There were no associations between BMAT and incident fractures in women or men. In conclusion, we found greater BMAT is associated with greater loss of trabecular bone at the spine and femoral neck, and greater loss of spine compressive strength, in older women. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for predictors of guideline-concordant treatment receipt. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for relationships between guideline-concordant treatment and overall survival using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Receipt of guideline-concordant treatment was less common among women with nonendometrioid histology (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.13-0.45) but was more common among women living in the Midwest (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.06-4.12) or West (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.49-6.13) compared to the Northeast. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, histology and stage, receipt of guideline-concordant EC treatment was borderline associated with improved overall survival (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.60-1.01) in the overall population. Guideline-concordant treatment was also linked with better overall survival among women with low-grade uterine-confined endometrioid EC or widely metastatic endometrioid EC. Guideline-concordant treatment varies by some patient characteristics and those women in receipt of guideline-concordant care had borderline improved survival.

Schizandrin A (SchA) is a bioactive lignin compound with strong anti-oxidant and anti-aging properties, which is stable at room temperature and is often stored in a cool dry place. Hence, we investigated the effects of SchA on MM cell line A375 and its underlying mechanism. A375 cells were used to construct an in vitro MM cell model. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, BrdU assay, flow cytometry, and transwell two-chamber assay, respectively. The cell cycle-related protein cyclin D1 and cell apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-9) were analyzed by western blot. Alteration of H19 expression was achieved by transfecting with pEX-H19. PI3K/AKT pathway was measured by detecting phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. SchA significantly decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, SchA inhibited cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression. SchA increased cell apoptosis along with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, and Bax) and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). Besides, SchA decreased migration and down-regulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. SchA down-regulated lncRNA H19. Overexpression of H19 blockaded the inhibitory effects of SchA on A375 cells. SchA decreased the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT while H19 overexpression promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT.

SBS was measured after three days of water storage (baseline) and after artificial aging (180 days of water storage along with 12,000 thermal cycles). Failure mode of fractured specimens also was evaluated. Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α=0.05). RXU showed 1) the lowest baseline median SBS to feldspathic ceramic, which was not statistically different from PAN; 2) the lowest median baseline SBS to leucite-reinforced feldspathic and densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramics. All cements performed similarly after aging, except for ARC (median 0.0 MPa) and PAN (median 16.2 MPa) in the densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic group.

This project aims to estimate the dietary exposure to more than 400 chemical compounds in the E3N cohort (Etude Epidémiologique après de femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale). In order to do so we developed a new database obtained by merging measures of chemical levels in commonly consumed food, from the second French Total Diet Study (TDS2), with the consumption data for food items of the E3N participants. E3N is a prospective cohort enrolled from 1990 with nearly 100,000 women aged between 40 to 65 years at inclusion. Participants complete a follow-up questionnaire every 2-3 years and dietary data were collected in 1993 and in 2005 using validated semi-quantitative food questionnaires developed according to the French meal pattern, collecting consumption information for 238 food items. The TDS2 analysed 445 different chemical substances in 186 core foods prepared as consumed. We attributed an occurrence value for each substance measured in the TDS2 study to all foods items included in the E3N food questionnaires. We identified 146 food items with a direct correspondence between the two databases. Alternatively, we attributed the weighted average of single foods using an <i>a posteriori</i> partition for 19 E3N food items. For 37 E3N food items not considered in the TDS2 we attributed the value of the most similar food measured in the TDS2. Overall 36 food items were excluded from the E3N-TDS2 database because no similar food was available. This study will allow estimating the dietary exposures to more than 400 chemical substances, either individually or as mixtures, in the E3N cohort, and therefore investigating their effect on the risk of chronic diseases, including cancers, diabetes, thyroid abnormalities, or ageing.</AbstractText>"}

Cell physiology","Date":"Dec 01 2019","Keywords":"L1, LINE-1, exercise, methylation, retrotransposons","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA and constitute approximately half of the human genome. LINE-1 (L1) is the only active autonomous TE in the mammalian genome and has been implicated in a number of diseases as well as aging. We have previously reported that skeletal muscle L1 expression is lower following acute and chronic exercise training in humans. Herein, we used a rodent model of voluntary wheel running to determine whether long-term exercise training affects markers of skeletal muscle L1 regulation. Selectively bred high-running female Wistar rats (<i>n</i> = 11 per group) were either given access to a running wheel (EX) or not (SED) at 5 wk of age, and these conditions were maintained until 27 wk of age. Thereafter, mixed gastrocnemius tissue was harvested and analyzed for L1 mRNA expression and DNA content along with other L1 regulation markers. We observed significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) lower L1 mRNA expression, higher L1 DNA methylation, and less L1 DNA in accessible chromatin regions in EX versus SED rats. We followed these experiments with 3-h in vitro drug treatments in L6 myotubes to mimic transient exercise-specific signaling events. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonist 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR; 4 mM) significantly decreased L1 mRNA expression in L6 myotubes. However, this effect was not facilitated through increased L1 DNA methylation. Collectively, these data suggest that long-term voluntary wheel running downregulates skeletal muscle L1 mRNA, and this may occur through chromatin modifications. Enhanced AMPK signaling with repetitive exercise bouts may also decrease L1 mRNA expression, although the mechanism of action remains unknown.</AbstractText>"}

Seventy-eight participants received active interventions and 14 received standard care. Of 92 total participants, the number who remained sarcopenic was reduced to 48 (of 73) after 3 months and 51 (of 75) after 6 months of intervention, indicating that 25 of 92 participants (27.2%) experienced sarcopenia reduction at 3 months and 24 of 92 (26.1%) had sarcopenia reduction at 6 months. Low KES was present in 88 of 92 patients (95.6%), and low GS in 30 of 92 patients (32.6%) at baseline. Among the components of sarcopenia, GS had the greatest change associated with active interventions, with 22 of 30 participants (73.3%) free of low GS at 6 months; in comparison, 17 of 88 participants (19.3%) were free of low KES at 6 months and 7 of 92 participants (7.6%) were free of low ASMI at 6 months. Men experienced greater reduction in sarcopenia than women (χ2 = 5.925; P = .02), as did those with younger age (t = -2.078; P = .04) or higher ASMI (mean [SD] ASMI, 5.74 [0.77] vs 5.14 [0.77] kg/m2; P = .002). Participants in the active intervention group experienced statistically significant decreases in sarcopenia score and its components at 3 months and 6 months from baseline (F = 14.138; P &lt; .001), but the intervention was not associated with significant differences in ASMI, KES, and GS vs standard care.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Conclusions and Relevance' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>This study suggests that older persons with sarcopenia are responsive to the effects of multidomain lifestyle interventions. Sarcopenia reduction was most pronounced through improved gait speed, and occurred more among those who were male, were younger, or had greater muscle mass.</AbstractText>"}

A worrying phenomenon worldwide is the increasing obesity among aging societies, which occurs in parallel with a higher prevalence of sarcopenia in older populations. As a result of the combination of these 2 states, new medical conditions, such as sarcopenic obesity, have recently become a public health concern. Data from the literature indicate a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and atherosclerosis among patients with sarcopenic obesity than the risk associated with simple obesity or sarcopenia alone. The mechanisms underlying sarcopenic obesity are multifactorial. There is an interplay between low‑grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, a sedentary lifestyle, eating habits, and aging. The aim of this review is to summarize the available data regarding the definition, epidemiology, and pathways that lead to sarcopenic obesity, as well as treatment strategies.</AbstractText>"}

Lost balance is the last step before the frequent experience of falls. After menopause, women's bone conditions regarding health and balance performance steeply decline often resulting in serious injury. Our purpose in the study is to identify balance performance and its associations with soft tissue components among Korean-American (KA) women with three menopausal conditions. Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study with 63 KA women divided into three age groups: 25-35 years (young), 45-55 years old (middle), and 65+ years (old). Lean and fat mass on the entire body, appendicular and gynoid areas were measured by using the dual X-ray absorptiometry. Static and dynamic balance and physical performance (floor sit to stand) were tested. We found that with increased aging, lean mass, fat and body mass index were changed; balance and physical performance decreased significantly. In regression models, age and fat ratio of android/gynoid changes explain static balance and physical performance; appendicular lean mass predicted dynamic balance. With advancing age, maintaining lean mass and proportion of fat accumulation is critical for stable balance.</AbstractText>"}

However, these are essentially optimized or modified classical protein chemistry techniques using conventional denaturing agents such as formic acid, urea, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The use of these denaturants has several shortcomings, including limited solubilization, contamination, and restrictions on absolute sample quantity and throughput. Here, we describe an alternative proteomic sample preparation platform for widespread aggregation analysis. This approach combines two techniques, (1) the use of ionic liquid for protein solubilization and (2) the recently published microbead-based and organic-media-assisted proteolysis strategy (BOPs), into a single-tube workflow. We demonstrate that the combined approach (<i>i</i>BOPs) enabled the successful solubilization of heat-aggregated hen egg whites within 10 min and supported sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The performance of the <i>i</i>BOPs system surpassed those of conventional detergents and chaotropes. Moreover, this technology enabled ultrasensitive proteomic characterization of protein aggregates deposited in individual <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes. We identified ubiquitin and other molecules as candidate stochastic factors whose accumulation levels varied among aging nematode individuals. The sensitivity and applicability of the present <i>i</i>BOPs make it especially attractive for next-stage aggregate proteomic analysis of various biological processes.</AbstractText>"}

In this article, we review findings from human and nonhuman animals, using behavioral, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and computational modeling methods, to show that the oculomotor and hippocampal memory systems interact in a reciprocal manner, on a moment-to-moment basis, mediated by a vast structural and functional network. Visual exploration serves to efficiently gather information from the environment for the purpose of creating new memories, updating existing memories, and reconstructing the rich, vivid details from memory. Conversely, memory increases the efficiency of visual exploration. We call for models of oculomotor control to consider the influence of the hippocampal memory system on the cognitive control of eye movements, and for models of hippocampal and broader medial temporal lobe function to consider the influence of the oculomotor system on the development and expression of memory. We describe eye movement-based applications for the detection of neurodegeneration and delivery of therapeutic interventions for mental health disorders for which the hippocampus is implicated and memory dysfunctions are at the forefront.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

As such, the introduction of supportive care represents the archetype of a new 'person-centred' approach and its characteristic needs. While the chronicity of the disease reflects advances in treatment, it also raises questions about a particularly long, cumbersome and painful treatment process for an aging and vulnerable population. In this perspective, the emergence of oncogeriatrics reflects the desire to personalize support and to take greater account of the specific needs of the elderly population. However, oncogeriatrics, a relatively new discipline, remains unstructured in the field. The dynamics of humanizing care inevitably come up against complex clinical situations, requiring reflection on its interest and limitations in its application. Thus, the purpose of this article is to propose an inventory of oncogeriatric care by raising a complex articulation between 'theory of care' and 'its implementation in the field'.</AbstractText>"}

In older subjects, unilateral hand movements typically rely on increased recruitment of ipsilateral frontoparietal areas. While the two central concepts of aging-related brain activity changes, 'Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults' (HAROLD), and 'Posterior to Anterior Shift in Aging' (PASA), have initially been suggested in the context of cognitive tasks and were attributed to compensation, current knowledge regarding the functional significance of increased motor system activity remains scarce. We, therefore, used online interference transcranial magnetic stimulation in young and older subjects to investigate the role of key regions of the ipsilateral frontoparietal cortex, that is, (a) primary motor cortex (M1), (b) dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and (c) anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in the control of hand movements of different motor demands. Our data suggest a change of the functional roles of ipsilateral brain areas in healthy age with a reduced relevance of ipsilateral M1 and a shift of importance toward dPMC for repetitive high-frequency movements.

The impacts of the alteration layer on glass durability have not been agreed upon in the glass science community. In particular, the formation mechanisms of hydrated glass alteration layers are still largely unknown and require further investigation, but these layers often require months to years to develop and are often too thin to adequately characterize. Meanwhile, sol-gel-derived silicate gels are relatively easy to synthesize in bulk with custom compositions relevant to hydrated glass alteration layers. If alteration layers and synthetic silicate gels demonstrate physical and chemical properties that are sufficiently similar, synthetic silicate gels could be used as analogues for hydrated glass alteration layers in future studies. However, synthetic gels must first be prepared and evaluated before comparisons between glass alteration layers and synthetic silicate gels can be made. This work focuses entirely on the synthesis and observed physical properties of synthetic silicate gels. A future work will compare the characteristics of synthetic gels described in this work with altered waste glass formed in similar pH environments. In this study, synthetic gels were made with custom compositions at various pH values to evaluate the effect of pH on gel structure and morphology. Several other variables were examined also, such as composition, drying, and aging. Gels were produced by sequential additions of organometallic precursors in a single container. Gels were analyzed with several techniques including small-angle X-ray scattering, gas adsorption, and He pycnometry to determine the effects of the variables on physical properties. Results show that gels prepared at pH 3 consistently contained fewer primary particles with diameters larger than 7.2 nm and fewer pores with diameters larger than 30 nm compared to gels synthesized at pH 7 and 9. Composition was shown to have no discernable effect on primary particle and pore sizes at any pH.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The role of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) in tendon maintenance and regeneration has received increasing attention in recent years. The decreased capacity of TSPCs in seniors contributes to impaired tendon functions and raises questions as to what extent these cells either affect, or cause ageing, and whether these age-related cellular alterations are caused by intrinsic factors or the cellular environment. In this review, recent discoveries concerning the biological characteristics of TSPCs and age-related changes in TSPCs, including the effects of cellular epigenetic alterations and the mechanisms involved in the ageing process, are analyzed. During the ageing process, TSPCs ageing might occur as a natural part of the tendon ageing, but could also result from decreased levels of growth factor, hormone deficits and changes in other related factors. Here, we discuss methods that might induce the rejuvenation of TSPC functions that are impaired during ageing, including moderate exercise, cell extracellular matrix condition, growth factors and hormones; these methods aim to rejuvenate the features of youthfulness with the ultimate goal of improving human health during ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>©The Author(s) 2019.

The lifespan of CS in the dry state is very variable among species. The physiological, biochemical, and biophysical mechanisms underpinning this variability remain understudied and their interpretation from an ecophysiological approach virtually unexplored. In this study, we aimed at fulfilling this gap by assessing photochemical, hydric, and biophysical properties of CS from three temperate species with contrasting biological strategies and longevity in the dry state: <i>Equisetum telmateia</i> (spore maturation and release in spring, ultrashort lifespan), <i>Osmunda regalis</i> (spore maturation and release in summer, medium lifespan), <i>Matteuccia struthiopteris</i> (spore maturation and release in winter, medium-long lifespan). After subjection of CS to controlled drying treatments, results showed that the three species displayed different extents of DT. CS of <i>E. telmateia</i> rapidly lost viability after desiccation, while the other two withstood several dehydration-rehydration cycles without compromising viability. The extent of DT was in concordance with water availability in the sporulation season of each species. CS of <i>O. regalis</i> and <i>M. struthiopteris</i> carried out the characteristic quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, widely displayed by other DT cryptogams during drying, and had higher tocopherol and proline contents. The turgor loss point of CS is also related to the extent of DT and to the sporulation season: lowest values were found in CS of <i>M. struthiopteris</i> and <i>O. regalis</i>. The hydrophobicity of spores in these two species was higher and probably related to the prevention of water absorption under unfavorable conditions. Molecular mobility, estimated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, confirmed an unstable glassy state in the spores of <i>E. telmateia</i>, directly related to the low DT, while the DT species entered in a stable glassy state when dried. Overall, our data revealed a DT syndrome related to the season of sporulation that was characterized by higher photoprotective potential, specific hydric properties, and lower molecular mobility in the dry state. Being unicellular haploid structures, CS represent not only a challenge for germplasm preservation (e.g., as these spores are prone to photooxidation) but also an excellent opportunity for studying mechanisms of DT in photosynthetic cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 López-Pozo, Ballesteros, Laza, García-Plazaola and Fernández-Marín.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This method is nowadays commonly used by clinicians to improve specific motor outcomes in various sub-populations such as elderly and young healthy adults, either sedentary or well-trained. The present study investigated the effects of acute WBV application on the balance control mechanisms during gait initiation (GI) in young healthy adults and elderly. It was hypothesized that the balance control mechanisms at play during gait initiation may compensate each other in case one or several components are perturbed following acute WBV application, so that postural stability and/or motor performance can be maintained or even improved. It is further hypothesized that this capacity of adaptation is altered with aging. Main results showed that the effects of acute WBV application on the GI postural organization depended on the age of participants. Specifically, a positive effect was observed on dynamic stability in the young adults, while no effect was observed in the elderly. An increased stance leg stiffness was also observed in the young adults only. The positive effect of WBV on dynamic stability was ascribed to an increase in the mediolateral amplitude of 'anticipatory postural adjustments' following WBV application, which did overcompensate the potentially destabilizing effect of the increased stance leg stiffness. In elderly, no such anticipatory (nor corrective) postural adaptation was required since acute WBV application did not elicit any change in the stance leg stiffness. These results suggest that WBV application may be effective in improving dynamic stability but at the condition that participants are able to develop adaptive changes in balance control mechanisms, as did the young adults. Globally, these findings are thus in agreement with the hypothesis that balance control mechanisms are interdependent within the postural system, i.e., they may compensate each other in case one component (here the leg stiffness) is perturbed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Delafontaine, Vialleron, Fischer, Laffaye, Chèze, Artico, Genêt, Fourcade and Yiou.</CopyrightInformation>"}

One purpose of this study is to compare these models with respect to goodness of fit to the data. A second purpose is to evaluate the generalizability of findings from the fastest divisional age class quartile to the slower quartiles. Archival listings by the Association of Road Racing Statisticians include a maximum of 100 fastest age class performances in marathon running performances by men and women. This database includes 937 performances by 387 men performances and 856 performances by 301 women. The mean ages are 62.05 years for men and 60.5 years for women. The mean numbers of performances per runner are 6.64 for men and 6.4 for women. Analysis by mixed linear modeling (MLM) indicates best goodness of fit for logarithms of performance time by a model that includes linear and quadratic expressions of age at entry into the database (termed 'entry cohort') and subsequent age changes (termed 'elapsed age') as variables. Findings with this model show higher performance times in women than men. Rates of increase in performance time are higher at older cohort ages and elapsed ages. Performance time increases with interactions between cohort age and elapsed age, cohort age and gender, and elapsed age and gender (i.e., with greater increases in women than men). Finally, increases in performance time with cohort age and elapsed age are higher in slower than faster performance quartiles, with athletes in the faster quartiles more likely to have multiple data entries and athletes in the slower quartiles single data entries.

Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms are emerging as a significant contributor to this clinical heterogeneity. These symptoms have been linked to multiple areas of neurodegeneration, which may suggest that they are representative of network-wide dysfunction in the brain. However, current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease focus exclusively on the cognitive aspects of disease. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms have been found in multiple studies to be related to disease severity and to contribute to disease progression over time.

Previous studies suggest that aging is accompanied by increases in cholinergic activity at the NMJ, which may play a role in neuromuscular degeneration. In this study, we hypothesized that moderately and chronically reducing ACh could attenuate the deleterious effects of aging on NMJs and skeletal muscles. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed NMJs and muscle fibers from heterozygous transgenic mice with reduced expression of the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT; VKD<sup>Het</sup>), which present with approximately 30% less synaptic ACh compared to control mice. Because ACh is constitutively decreased in VKD<sup>Het</sup>, we first analyzed developing NMJs and muscle fibers. We found no obvious morphological or molecular differences between NMJs and muscle fibers of VKD<sup>Het</sup> and control mice during development. In contrast, we found that moderately reducing ACh has various effects on adult NMJs and muscle fibers. VKD<sup>Het</sup> mice have significantly larger NMJs and muscle fibers compared to age-matched control mice. They also present with reduced expression of the pro-atrophy gene, Foxo1, and have more satellite cells in skeletal muscles. These molecular and cellular features may partially explain the increased size of NMJs and muscle fibers. Thus, moderately reducing ACh may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with advancing age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Vaughan, Sutherland and Valdez.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The interaction of age and sex on individual subcortical structures provides evidence to support the impact of sex on psychopathologies associated with degenerative brain disorders in the elderly. The findings may be significant to investigate the occurrence and prevalence of degenerative brain disorders in males and females.

In the healthy brain, sleep/wake cycles are a well-coordinated interaction between metabolic and neuronal activity, but when disrupted, are associated with a myriad of health-related issues, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, T2D, and AD. Therefore, this review will explore our current understanding of the relationship between metabolism, sleep, and AD-related pathology to identify the causes and consequences of disease progression in AD.

However, in humans, the accurate origin of PyT from BA 6 is still uncertain owing to difficulties in visualizing anatomical features such as the fanning shape at the corona radiata and multiple crossings at the semioval centrum. High angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) could reliably replicate these anatomical features. We explored the origin of the human PyT from BA 6 using HARDI. With HARDI data of 30 adults from the Massachusetts General Hospital-Human Connectome Project (MGH-HCP) database and the HCP 1021 template (average of 1021 HCP diffusion data), we visualized the PyT at the 30-averaged group level and the 1021 large-sample level and validated the observations in each of the individuals. Endpoints of the fibers within each subregion were quantified. PyT fibers originating from the BA 6 were consistently visualized in all images. Specifically, the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal premotor area (dPMA) were consistently found to contribute to the PyT. PyT fibers from BA 6 and those from BA 4 exhibited a twisting topology. The PyT contains fibers originating from the SMA and dPMA in BA 6. Infarction of these regions or aging would result in incomplete provision of information to the PyT and concomitant decreases in motor planning and coordination abilities.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Wang, Shan, Zhang, Wei, Li, Yin and Lu.</CopyrightInformation>"}

ELOVL4 is the only family member that catalyzes production of Very Long Chain Saturated Fatty Acids (VLC-SFA) and Very Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (VLC-PUFA) with chain lengths ≥28 carbons. ELOVL4 and its VLC-SFA and VLC-PUFA products are emerging as important regulators of synaptic signaling and neuronal survival in the central nervous system (CNS). Distinct sets of mutations in <i>ELOVL4</i> cause three different neurological diseases in humans. Heterozygous inheritance of one set of autosomal dominant <i>ELOVL4</i> mutations that leads to truncation of the ELOVL4 protein causes Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STGD3), an aggressive juvenile-onset retinal degeneration. Heterozygous inheritance of a different set of autosomal dominant <i>ELOVL4</i> mutations that leads to a full-length protein with single amino acid substitutions causes spinocerebellar ataxia 34 (SCA34), a late-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by gait ataxia and cerebellar atrophy. Homozygous inheritance of a different set of <i>ELOVL4</i> mutations causes a more severe disease with infantile onset characterized by seizures, spasticity, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, and premature death. ELOVL4 is expressed widely in the CNS and is found primarily in neurons. ELOVL4 is expressed in cell-specific patterns within different regions of the CNS that are likely to be related to disease symptoms. In the retina, ELOVL4 is expressed exclusively in photoreceptors and produces VLC-PUFA that are incorporated into phosphatidylcholine and enriched in the light sensitive membrane disks of the photoreceptor outer segments. VLC-PUFA are enzymatically converted into 'elovanoid' compounds that appear to provide paracrine signals that promote photoreceptor and neuronal survival. In the brain, the main ELOVL4 products are VLC-SFA that are incorporated into sphingolipids and enriched in synaptic vesicles, where they regulate kinetics of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Understanding the function of ELOVL4 and its VLC-SFA and VLC-PUFA products will advance our understanding of basic mechanisms in neural signaling and has potential for developing novel therapies for seizure and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Deák, Anderson, Fessler and Sherry.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Synaptic loss is an important feature of early AD, and the formation of new synapses is dependent on key nutritional elements that are known to be deficient in patients with AD. The daily medical food, Souvenaid, contains Fortasyn Connect, a multinutrient combination developed to specifically address these deficiencies, comprising docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, uridine monophosphate, choline, phospholipids, selenium, folic acid, and vitamins B12, B6, C, and E. Although yielding heterogeneous findings, clinical studies of Fortasyn Connect provide preliminary evidence of clinically relevant benefits on cognitive outcomes in prodromal and early AD. The LipiDiDiet trial investigated the effects of Fortasyn Connect on cognition and related measures in prodromal AD, and is the first randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial study of a non-pharmacological intervention in this setting. The primary efficacy endpoint was change over 24 months in a composite score of cognitive performance using a neuropsychological test battery. Fortasyn Connect had no significant effect on this endpoint, but demonstrated a significant benefit on secondary endpoints, including domains of cognition affected by AD (attention, memory, executive function) and hippocampal atrophy, suggesting a potential benefit on disease progression. Other studies have demonstrated benefits for Fortasyn Connect on nutritional markers and levels of plasma homocysteine. Taken together, current evidence indicates that Fortasyn Connect may show benefit on domains of cognition affected by AD and nutritional measures that influence risk factors for its progression; that it has greater potential for benefit earlier rather than later in the disease; and that it is safe and well tolerated, alone or in combination with AD medications. Further research into its potential role in AD management is therefore warranted.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Rasmussen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In addition to posing a substantial burden to disease and negatively impacting quality of life, an emerging literature highlights that HL is associated with unipolar depression including among older adults. This review outlines evidence examining the HL and depression relationship as well as clinical implications for assessment and treatment of comorbid depression and HL. Although prevalence estimates of comorbid depression in HL vary, as many as 1 in 5 experience clinically relevant depression symptoms. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies indicate that HL is related to increased unipolar depression symptoms, although the strength of the association varies between studies. A range of methodological variations, such as inclusion age, severity of HL and assessment of depression, likely underpin this heterogeneity. Overall, however, the evidence clearly points to an association of HL with clinically relevant depression symptoms. The association with the diagnosis of major depression disorder remains less clear and under-researched. HL is also associated with a range of other poor mental health outcomes in older adults, including anxiety and suicidal ideation, and predicts poorer cognitive functioning. Accordingly, assessment and treatment of comorbid depression in HL is pertinent to promote mental well-being among older adults. Currently, evidence regarding best practice for treating depression in HL remains scant. Preliminary evidence indicates that audiological rehabilitation, including use of hearing aids, as well as community-based hearing interventions can also improve mental health. Psychological intervention that enhances communication skills and addresses coping strategies might also be beneficial for this population. Additionally, evidence suggests that online interventions are feasible and may circumvent communication difficulties in therapy associated with HL. Due to poor help-seeking among this population, an enhanced focus on specific and targeted assessment and treatment is likely necessary to ensure reduced mental health burden among older adults with HL.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Cosh et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Bacteria in this state tend to be tolerant to antibiotics and are often referred to as dormant. <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i>, a phototrophic alphaproteobacterium, can remain fully viable for more than 4 months when its growth is arrested. Here, we show that protein synthesis, specific proteins involved in translation, and a stringent response are required for this remarkable longevity. Because it can generate ATP from light during growth arrest, <i>R. palustris</i> is an extreme example of a bacterial species that will stay alive for long periods of time as a relatively homogeneous population of cells and it is thus an excellent model organism for studies of bacterial longevity. There is evidence that other Gram-negative species also continue to synthesize proteins during growth arrest and that a stringent response is required for their longevity as well. Our observations challenge the notion that growth-arrested cells are necessarily dormant and metabolically inactive and suggest that such bacteria may have a level of metabolic activity that is higher than many would have assumed. Our results also expand our mechanistic understanding of a crucial but understudied phase of the bacterial life cycle.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> We are surrounded by bacteria, but they do not completely dominate our planet despite the ability of many to grow extremely rapidly in the laboratory.

While cancer cells rarely colonize muscle, they often induce a debilitating muscle-wasting condition known as cachexia that compromises feeding, breathing, and cardiac function in metastatic cancer patients. In fact, nearly 80% of metastatic cancer patients experience a spectrum of muscle-wasting states, which deteriorates the quality of life and overall survival of cancer patients. Muscle wasting in cancer results from increased muscle catabolism induced by circulating tumor factors and a systemic metabolic dysfunction. In addition, muscle loss can be exacerbated by the exposure to antineoplastic therapies and the process of aging. With no approved therapies to alleviate cachexia, muscle health, therefore, becomes a key determinant of prognosis, treatment response, and survival in metastatic cancer patients.

Blocking the ensuing reconsolidation process is suggested as a therapeutic target for unwanted aversive memories. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is required for structural synapse remodeling involved in memory consolidation. Inhibiting MMP-9 with doxycycline is suggested to attenuate human threat conditioning. Here, we investigated whether MMP-9 inhibition also interferes with threat memory reconsolidation. Male and female human participants (<i>N</i> = 78) learned the association between two visual conditioned stimuli (CS<sup>+</sup>) and a 50% chance of an unconditioned nociceptive stimulus (US), and between CS<sup>-</sup> and the absence of US. On day 7, one CS<sup>+</sup> was reminded without reinforcement 3.5 h after ingesting either 200 mg of doxycycline or placebo. On day 14, retention of CS memory was assessed under extinction by fear-potentiated startle. Contrary to our expectations, we observed a greater CS<sup>+</sup>/CS<sup>-</sup> difference in participants who were reminded under doxycycline compared with placebo. Participants who were reminded under placebo showed extinction learning during the retention test, which was not observed in the doxycycline group. There was no difference between the reminded and the nonreminded CS<sup>+</sup> in either group. In contrast, during relearning after the retention test, the CS<sup>+</sup>/CS<sup>-</sup> difference was more pronounced in the placebo group than in the doxycycline group. To summarize, a single dose of doxycycline before threat memory reminder appeared to have no specific impact on reconsolidation, but to globally impair extinction learning, and threat relearning, beyond drug clearance.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition appears to attenuate memory consolidation. It could also be a target for blocking reconsolidation. Here, we test this hypothesis in human threat conditioning. We find that doxycycline has no specific impact on a reminded cue, but confers a global reduction in extinction learning and threat learning beyond the clearance of the drug.

However, knowledge about further improving integrated care is limited. In fourteen integrated care sites in Europe, plans to improve existing ways of working were designed, implemented and evaluated to enlarge the understanding of what works and with what outcomes when improving integrated care. This paper provides insight into the existing ways that the sites were working with respect to integrated care, their perceived difficulties and their plans for working towards improvement. The seven components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model provided a conceptual framework for describing the fourteen sites. Although sites were spread across Europe and differed in basic characteristics and existing ways of working, a number of difficulties in delivering integrated care were similar. Existing ways of working and improvement plans mostly focused on three components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model: delivery system design; decision support; self-management. Two components were represented less frequently in existing ways of working and improvement plans: building healthy public policy; building community capacity. These findings suggest that broadly-based prevention efforts, population health promotion and community involvement remain limited. From the Expanded Chronic Care Model perspective, therefore, opportunities for improving integrated care outcomes may continue to be restricted by the narrow focus of developed improvement plans.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

While SMA is primarily considered as a motor neuron disease, recent data suggests that survival motor neuron (SMN) deficiency in muscle causes intrinsic defects. We systematically profiled secreted proteins from control and SMN deficient muscle cells with two combined metabolic labeling methods and mass spectrometry. From the screening, we found lower levels of C1q/TNF-related protein 3 (CTRP3) in the SMA muscle secretome and confirmed that CTRP3 levels are indeed reduced in muscle tissues and serum of an SMA mouse model. We identified that CTRP3 regulates neuronal protein synthesis including SMN via mTOR pathway. Furthermore, CTRP3 enhances axonal outgrowth and protein synthesis rate, which are well-known impaired processes in SMA motor neurons. Our data revealed a new molecular mechanism by which muscles regulate the physiology of motor neurons via secreted molecules. Dysregulation of this mechanism contributes to the pathophysiology of SMA.</AbstractText>"}

Recent insights into phase-separated membraneless organelles may be the key for answering this. Of the two models that have been proposed for phase-separated entities, one largely depends on chromatin-protein interactions and the other on multivalent protein-protein and/or protein-RNA ones. Each has its own characteristics, but both would be able to, at least in part, explain chromatin and transcriptional organization.

The prevalence of obesity according to the BMI z-score, WC, and WHtR was 9.6%, 11.2%, and 15.0%, respectively. Across all age and sex groups, a negative association was found between relative peak oxygen uptake ( V ˙ O<sub>2</sub>peak) and BMI, WC, and WHtR. In boys and girls there were higher levels of performance across all age groups, with most apparent gains between the ages of 13 and 14 years old. Overall, participants categorized in the healthy group had shown to have significantly higher V ˙ O<sub>2</sub>peak than their obese counterparts (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; Cohen's <i>d</i> &gt; 1.0). In conclusion, our study provides age- and sex-specific reference values for CRF ( V ˙ O<sub>2</sub>peak, mL·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>). The anthropometric parameters were inversely associated with CRF in all ages in both sexes. The obese group had worse CRF than their healthy counterparts independent of anthropometric parameters used to determine obesity.</AbstractText>"}

A literature search was conducted. Twelve studies, eight randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and four pre-post studies, resulted as eligible for the meta-analysis, which was performed through a Bayesian random-effects model. All studies analyzed probiotics, and none of them analyzed prebiotics or synbiotics. The treatments effects were measured in terms of odds ratio (OR) of OC (CFU/mL &gt;10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>3</sup>, or 10<sup>4</sup>). The meta-analytic OR was 0.71 (95% credibility interval (CrI): 0.37, 1.32), indicating a beneficial effect of treatment; the <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> index was 56.3%. Focusing only on RCTs, the OR was larger and more precise at 0.53 (95% CrI: 0.27, 0.93). The effect of treatment appeared to be larger on denture wearers. Our findings indicate that the intake of probiotics can have a beneficial effect on OC and that the effects could vary according to the patients' characteristics. Due to the presence of medium-high-risk studies, the results should be interpreted with caution.</AbstractText>"}

It was reported that thirst-driven fluid intake (TDFI) may optimize cycling performance, compared with when fluid is consumed more than thirst dictates. However, how TDFI, compared with PFI and NFI, impacts performance during a 1 h cycling time-trial performance remains unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of NFI, TDFI and PFI on 1 h cycling time-trial performance. Using a randomized, crossover and counterbalanced protocol, 9 (7 males and 2 females) trained endurance athletes (30 ± 9 years; Peak V · O<sub>2</sub>∶ 59 ± 8 mL·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>) completed three 1 h cycling time-trials (30 °C, 50% RH) with either NFI, TDFI or PFI designed to maintain body mass (BM) at ~0.5% of pre-exercise BM.

Especially, the metabolic imbalance of androgen in elderly men is one of the leading causes of BPH. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and converted testosterone by 5-α reductase type 2 (5AR2), binding with androgen receptor (AR), affect prostate proliferation and growth. In BPH, levels of androgen signaling-related protein expression are shown highly. Androgen signaling induces the overexpression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and cell proliferation factor such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1. Grape skin anthocyanins are well known for their antioxidative, anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-aging activities. Polymerized anthocyanin (PA) downregulated the expression of androgen signaling-related proteins such as 5AR2, AR, and PSA in LNCaP cell lines. Furthermore, we investigated the effects on PA in testosterone propionate-induced BPH rat experiments. The oral administration of PA decreased the prostate weight in rats with TP-induced BPH. PA decreased the AR, 5AR2, SRC1, PSA, PCNA, and cyclin D1 expression in prostate tissues and the serum DHT levels, ameliorated the BPH-mediated increase of Bcl-2 expression, and increased the Bax expression. These results suggest that PA may be a potential natural therapeutic agent for BPH treatment.</AbstractText>"}

For 1974 participants with complete information, the two-part model was used to assess how health groups and socio-demographic characteristics influence the outpatient and inpatient expenditure. Four health groups were identified and labeled as 'Lacking Socialization' (10.4%), 'High Comorbidity' (16.7%), 'Severe Disability' (7.8%), and 'Relative Health' (65.1%). Compared with the relative health group, the lacking socialization group cost higher inpatient expenditure (<i>p</i> = 0.02).

A series of heat treatment routes were designed based on the phase relations in IN718 and performed for the optimization. The microstructure and phase compositions of the SPS IN718 alloys were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties of the samples were characterized at room temperature and at 650 °C. The results showed that large amounts of γ' (Ni<sub>3</sub>Nb) and γ' (Ni<sub>3</sub>(Al, Ti)) strengthening phases precipitated in the IN718 alloy after direct aging (DA) of the as-fabricated sample. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the DA sample were comparable to that of the best one of the solution-treated and aged counterparts. The analysis showed that the rapid sintering and solid solution treatment of the IN718 alloy were achieved simultaneously by SPS. In the case of the SPS IN718 material, the direct aging regime had the same heat treatment effect as the conventional solid solution and aging treatment. This contributes toward improving the production efficiency and reduces manufacturing costs in the actual production process.</AbstractText>"}

Two hundred and two (202) valid samples were collected by a questionnaire survey to analyze their intentions to buy health products on WeChat. Theoretical models and corresponding research hypotheses were verified by structural equation modeling. The research results show that emotional price and emotional experience are positively correlated with trust and purchase intention. There is an obvious negative correlation between privacy invasion and trust. Expectation confirmation is positively associated with trust. Moreover, the intermediary test shows that trust has completely mediated between emotional price and purchase intention, and trust also has a full intermediary effect on expectation confirmation and purchase intention.</AbstractText>"}

FBB pretreatment inhibited UVB-mediated type-1 procollagen degradation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-2 protein expression, and suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in Hs68. In addition, FBB administration diminished the wrinkle formation in dorsal skin and epidermal thickening in UVB-irradiated hairless mice. Moreover, UVB-induced Type-1 procollagen reduction and antioxidant enzyme inactivation were reversed by FBB administration. These results suggest that FBB may have antiphotoaging effects on UVB-induced wrinkle formation by maintaining the extracellular matrix density in the dermis, which occurs via regulation of reactive oxygen species and related MAPK and NF-κB signaling. Therefore, FBB can be a potential candidate for protecting skin aging against UV irradiation.</AbstractText>"}

Aging and diabetes mellitus (DM) are processes that are both associated with increased collagen crosslinking that leads to increased corneal rigidity. By contrast, keratoconus (KC) is a corneal thinning disease associated with decreased mechanical stiffness leading to ectasia of the central cornea. Studies have suggested that crosslinking mediated by reactive advanced glycation end products during DM may protect the cornea from KC development. Parallel to this hypothesis, riboflavin-mediated photoreactive corneal crosslinking has been proposed as a therapeutic option to halt the progression of corneal thinning by inducing intra- and intermolecular crosslink formation within the collagen fibrils of the stroma, leading to stabilization of the disease. Here, we review the pathobiology of DM and KC in the context of corneal structure, the epidemiology behind the inverse correlation of DM and KC development, and the chemical mechanisms of lysyl oxidase-mediated crosslinking, advanced glycation end product-mediated crosslinking, and photoreactive riboflavin-mediated corneal crosslinking.

Oligodendrocytes need to be newly formed from a pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The differentiation of OPCs into mature and myelinating cells is a multistep process, tightly controlled by spatiotemporal activation and repression of specific growth and transcription factors. While oligodendrocyte turnover is rather slow under physiological conditions, a disruption in this balanced differentiation process, for example in case of a differentiation block, could have devastating consequences during ageing and in pathological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis. Over the recent years, increasing evidence has shown that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, are major contributors to OPC differentiation. In this review, we discuss how these epigenetic mechanisms orchestrate and influence oligodendrocyte maturation. These insights are a crucial starting point for studies that aim to identify the contribution of epigenetics in demyelinating diseases and may thus provide new therapeutic targets to induce myelin repair in the long run.</AbstractText>"}

The porous mixes manufactured with the slags provided similar results to the conventional standard mixtures. Some issues were noted in relation to compaction difficulties and the higher void contents of the slag mixtures, which reduced their resistance to raveling.

Moreover, current therapeutic approaches, which aimed to prevent or minimize ischemia-induced damage, are associated with relevant costs for healthcare systems. Early reperfusion by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) has undoubtedly improved patient's outcomes; however, the prevention of long-term complications is still an unmet need. To face these hurdles and improve patient's outcomes, novel pharmacological and interventional approaches, alone or in combination, reducing myocardium oxygen consumption or supplying blood flow via collateral vessels have been proposed. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to validate their efficacy on patient's outcomes. Alternative options, including stem cell-based therapies, have been evaluated to improve cardiac regeneration and prevent scar formation. However, due to the lack of long-term engraftment, more recently, great attention has been devoted to their paracrine mediators, including exosomes (Exo) and microvesicles (MV). Indeed, Exo and MV are both currently considered to be one of the most promising therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine. As a matter of fact, MV and Exo that are released from stem cells of different origin have been evaluated for their healing properties in ischemia reperfusion (I/R) settings. Therefore, this review will first summarize mechanisms of cardiac damage and protection after I/R damage to track the paths through which more appropriate interventional and/or molecular-based targeted therapies should be addressed. Moreover, it will provide insights on novel non-invasive/invasive interventional strategies and on Exo-based therapies as a challenge for improving patient's long-term complications. Finally, approaches for improving Exo healing properties, and topics still unsolved to move towards Exo clinical application will be discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Mouse rsfMRI has been increasingly adopted by numerous laboratories worldwide. Here we describe a multi-centre comparison of 17 mouse rsfMRI datasets via a common image processing and analysis pipeline. Despite prominent cross-laboratory differences in equipment and imaging procedures, we report the reproducible identification of several large-scale resting-state networks (RSN), including a mouse default-mode network, in the majority of datasets. A combination of factors was associated with enhanced reproducibility in functional connectivity parameter estimation, including animal handling procedures and equipment performance. RSN spatial specificity was enhanced in datasets acquired at higher field strength, with cryoprobes, in ventilated animals, and under medetomidine-isoflurane combination sedation. Our work describes a set of representative RSNs in the mouse brain and highlights key experimental parameters that can critically guide the design and analysis of future rodent rsfMRI investigations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, as mice have become an invaluable model for skin research, determining murine skin's mechanical properties is important. Specifically, skin's mechanical properties are important for functional tests as well as for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Additionally, computational simulations of skin behavior are becoming commonplace, rendering accurate models of murine skin's constitutive behavior necessary. To date, our knowledge of mouse skin mechanics shows significant gaps. For example, there are no comprehensive reports correlating skin's mechanical properties with region, age, and direction. Moreover, mouse skin's residual strain behavior has not been reported on. In our current work, we set out to fill these gaps. Based on histology, 2-photon microscopy, and planar biaxial testing, while accurately tracking various reference configurations, we report on differences in gross structure, microstructural organization, and constitutive response of skin, and cast those properties into a versatile Fung-type hyperelastic constitutive law for three reference configurations. Our data is the most comprehensive report contrasting the mechanical properties of young (12 weeks) and aged (52 weeks) mouse skin and will, thus, be valuable to basic science as control data, and provide accurate constitutive laws for mouse skin modeling. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings are significant as they fill several gaps in our understanding of mouse skin mechanics. This is particularly important as mouse skin is becoming a frequent and critical model of human skin for cosmetic and medical science. Specifically, we quantified how mechanical properties of mice skin vary with age, with location, and with direction. Additionally, we cast our findings into constitutive models that can be used by others for predictive computer simulations of skin behavior.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

However, much less is known regarding age-related differences in time spent engaging in stimulus-independent thoughts or in their neural correlates in the absence of an ongoing task. In the current study, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while 29 young (mean age = 22y) and 22 older (mean age = 70y) adults underwent experience sampling in the absence of an ongoing task (i.e., at 'rest'). Although both age groups reported spending a similar amount of time engaged in stimulus-independent thoughts, older adults rated their thoughts as more present-oriented (rather than atemporal) and more novel. Moreover, controlling for these age-related differences in content, we found that experiencing stimulus-independent thoughts was associated with increased posterior cingulate and left angular gyrus activation across age groups compared to exhibiting an external focus of attention. When experiencing stimulus-independent thoughts, younger adults engaged medial and left lateral prefrontal cortex as well as left superior temporal gyrus to a greater degree than older adults. Taken together, our results suggest that, in the absence of an ongoing task, although young and older adults spend a similar amount of time engaging in stimulus-independent thoughts, the content and neural correlates of these thoughts differ with age.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study was to develop a multidimensional tool to measure frailty in an ageing, free-living study population. The 'accumulation of deficits approach' was used to develop a frailty index (FI) to characterize a sub-sample (N = 815) of the EPIC-Potsdam (EPIC-P) study population regarding the aging phenomenon. The EPIC-P frailty index (EPIC-P-FI) included 32 variables from the following domains: health, physical ability, psychosocial and physiological aspects. P-values were calculated for the linear trend between sociodemographic and life style variables and the EPIC-P-FI was calculated using regression analysis adjusted for age. The relationship between the EPIC-P-FI and age was investigated using fractional polynomials. Some characteristics such as age, education, time spent watching TV, cycling and a biomarker of inflammation (C-reactive protein) were associated with frailty in men and women. Interestingly, living alone, having no partner and smoking status were only associated with frailty in men, and alcohol use and physical fitness (VO2max) only in women. The generated, multidimensional FI, adapted to the EPIC-P study, showed that this cohort is a valuable source for further exploration of factors that promote healthy ageing.</AbstractText>"}

This is important for musculoskeletal modeling, where the muscle force-generating properties of generic models are defined by these data but may not be valid when applied to models of young, healthy individuals. Obtaining individualized muscle architecture data in vivo is difficult, however diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) has recently emerged as a valid method of achieving this. DTI was used here to provide an architecture data set of 20 lower limb muscles from 10 healthy adults, including muscle fiber lengths, which are important inputs for Hill-type muscle models commonly used in musculoskeletal modeling. Maximum isometric force and muscle fiber lengths were found not to scale with subject anthropometry, suggesting that these factors may be difficult to predict using scaling or optimization algorithms. These data also highlight the high level of anatomical variation that exists between individuals in terms of lower limb muscle architecture, which supports the need of incorporating subject-specific force-generating properties into musculoskeletal models to optimize their accuracy for clinical evaluation.</AbstractText>"}

The successful application of attractants requires that constituents are placed in a suitable dispensing system to reduce volatilization and increase the effective field longevity of the attractant. A series of trials were conducted in different fruit orchards to test 1) the efficiency of a polyethylene-matrix plug in regulating the emission rate of TML 2) and the lifetime attractiveness of the plug compared to the cotton wick dispenser. Cotton dispensers containing the recommended dose of TML (0.75 cm3) and with a double dose (1.5 cm3) remained active for 6 and 8 wk, respectively. The increase in TML dose from 0.75 cm3 to 1.5 cm3 led to an increase in the longevity of the cotton dispenser, but there was no significant difference between the doses in biological activity. In all trials, TML-polyethylene matrix dispensers were more efficient under field conditions as they attracted more males for up to 12 wk and prolonged the release of TML more than the cotton wick dispensers. The TML-loaded polyethylene matrix dispensers might be useful in 1) minimizing the losses of the liquid TML from cotton wicks, 2) avoiding the damage that occurs when using other dispensers, 3) prolonging the TML lifetime in the field through regulating its release rates, 4) potentially minimizing the adverse effect of high temperatures on release rate, and, finally, 5) minimizing the costs of using large amounts of expensive TML solutions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, strong empirical tests of this assumption are scarce. In two complementary studies, we examined whether older age is associated with less diversity in daily life experiences (e.g., regarding social interaction partners, activities, and places across and within days) and, if so, to what extent health limitations account for these age differences. In Study 1, we used daily diaries to investigate diversity across days among younger (N = 246; M<sub>age</sub> = 21.8 years, SD = 2.5) and older adults (N = 119; M<sub>age</sub> = 67.7 years, SD = 5.3). In Study 2, we investigated diversity within days employing experience sampling methods over three weeks in an adult life span sample (N = 365; range = 14-88 years). Results showed that across and within days, the daily lives of older adults were less diverse regarding their social interaction partners. Yet, older adults reported more diversity in activities within days and across days in the afternoons, whereas younger adults reported less diverse activities partly due to working or studying more often. Age differences remained statistically significant when controlling for health limitations. We conclude that age differences in the diversity of daily life are nuanced, depending on the domain and the level of analysis.

This ability declines in late adulthood and has been linked to age-related differences in cognitive functioning. Other factors, which may also drive difference in motor planning in later adulthood have not been systematically examined. These include perceptions of comfort and levels of motor imagery ability (one's ability to mentally simulate action/predict the outcome of action). Therefore, this study investigated the constraints on movement planning across the life span, including executive functions, general motor ability, physical constraints to movement and motor imagery ability. One hundred and twenty-two participants aged 20-81 years completed an end-state-comfort task with increasing levels of complexity. Individuals' executive functions, motor control, motor imagery ability, and perceived rotation span were also examined. Age-related decline was shown in planning for sequential movements but not in simple single-step movements. Motor planning demonstrated an age-related difference that was associated with an increasing number of constraints as age increased, and in older adults chronological age influenced the effect of each constraint on motor planning. Age-related difference in motor planning may reflect effective compensatory strategies in response to differing constraints in motor imagery ability, executive functions, perceived rotation span, and general speed and accuracy of movement as we age.

This study examined whether parental ambivalence toward their nondisabled children is greater in families of adults with disabilities (developmental disabilities [DD] or serious mental illnesses [SMI]) than families without any adult children with disabilities. The study also investigated whether ambivalence mediates the associations between having an adult child with DD or SMI and parents' health. Data were from the 2011 Wisconsin Longitudinal Study in which aging parents (M<sub>age</sub> = 71; n = 6,084) were asked about their relationship with each of their adult children. Multilevel regression models and multilevel structural equation models were estimated to analyze the data. Our findings showed that parents of an adult with SMI felt greater ambivalence toward their nondisabled adult children than comparison group parents of adult children without disabilities, whereas no significant differences were found between parents of an adult child with DD and comparison group parents. Parental ambivalence toward their nondisabled adult children played a significant indirect role in the negative association between having a child with SMI and parental physical and mental health. The findings have implications for clinical practice with aging families of adults with disabilities and suggest the need for additional research to better understand intergenerational parent-adult child dynamics in these families.

The reactivities and selectivities of the disodium salts largely mirror those of the dilithium salts but without the requisite large excesses of inorganic salts (LiCl) or mandated dilute solutions. The disodium salts require careful control of temperature to preclude deleterious aggregate aging effects traced to changes in the aggregate structure and intervening O-alkylations. Structural studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations show a dominant highly symmetric polyhedron quite different from the lithium analogue. No enolate-NaDA mixed aggregates are observed with excess NaDA. Rate studies show an alkylation mechanism involving an intervening tetramer-monomer pre-equilibrium followed by rate-limiting alkylation of tetrasolvated monomers. DFT computations were conducted to explore the possible influences on stereochemistry. A crystal deriving from samples aged at ambient temperature contains six dianionic subunits and two monoanionic (alkoxide-only) subunits.

The prestige and credibility of modern medicine is built in large part on achievements in preventing and treating infectious diseases. For most of human history, there was little that could be done to prevent and treat infections. Millions of humans, of all ages, have died from infections; and in some parts of the world, infection-related deaths remain common. Advances in preventing and treating infectious diseases include improved sanitization, sterilization, pasteurization, immunization, and antibiotics. Vaccination has played a major role in the prevention of lethal diseases, such as smallpox, diphtheria, cholera, and influenza. Because of developing or waning immune function, the young and the old are at particularly high risk of experiencing infections. Influenza and pneumonia remain common causes of death in older adults. Influenza, in particular, has the potential to result in premature mortality for all age groups, including those who are older and particularly those who live in congregate settings.

This rhythmic excitability has been widely observed but, critically, its regulation remains unresolved. We have characterized and modelled the changes underlying these electrical activity rhythms in the lateral ventral clock neurons (LNvs). We show that currents mediated by the voltage-gated potassium channels Shaw (Kv3) and Shal (Kv4) oscillate in a circadian manner. Disruption of these channels, by expression of dominant negative (DN) subunits, leads to changes in circadian locomotor activity and shortens lifespan. LNv whole-cell recordings then show that changes in Shaw and Shal currents drive changes in action potential firing rate and that these rhythms are abolished when the circadian molecular clock is stopped. A whole-cell biophysical model using Hodgkin-Huxley equations can recapitulate these changes in electrical activity. Based on this model and by using dynamic clamp to manipulate clock neurons directly, we can rescue the pharmacological block of Shaw and Shal, restore the firing rhythm, and thus demonstrate the critical importance of Shaw and Shal. Together, these findings point to a key role for Shaw and Shal in controlling circadian firing of clock neurons and show that changes in clock neuron currents can account for this. Moreover, with dynamic clamp we can switch the LNvs between morning-like and evening-like states of electrical activity. We conclude that changes in Shaw and Shal underlie the daily oscillation in LNv firing rate.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Slow fibers are suited for long lasting and low intensity contractile activity, while various subtypes of fast fibers are optimized to produce high force and power even with a significant fatigue. The functional specialization of muscle fibers is based on selective gene expression regulation, which provides each fiber with a specific protein complement. The recent refinement of small-scale sample preparation, combined with the development of mass spectrometers characterized by high sensitivity, sequencing speed and mass accuracy, has allowed the characterization of the proteome of single muscle fibers with an unprecedented resolution. In the last few years, the first studies on the global proteomics of individual fibers of different types have been published. In this short review we discuss the methodological advancements which have opened the way to single fiber proteomics and the discovery power of this approach. We provide examples of how specific features of single fibers can be overlooked when whole muscle or multi-fiber samples are analyzed and can only be detected when a single fiber proteome is analyzed. Thus, novel subtype-specific metabolic features, most prominently mitochondrial specialization of fiber types have been revealed by single fiber proteomics. In the same way, specific adaptive responses of single fibers to aging or loss of neural input have been detected when single fibers were individually analyzed. We conclude that the fiber type-resolved proteomes represent a powerful tool which can be applied to a variety of physiological and pathological conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Processes & impacts","Date":"Dec 11 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Coliphages, viruses that infect Escherichia coli, have been used for decades to assess surface water quality yet there is no guideline for interpreting their concentrations. The present study uses a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework to derive risk-based surface water quality thresholds for somatic and F+ or male-specific coliphages. The risk-based threshold is the concentration at which the risk of gastro-intestinal illness is simulated to be 32/1000. The framework specifically investigates a simplified hazard scenario where recreational swimmers come into contact with water contaminated with untreated sewage containing coliphages and enteric pathogens. The framework considers exposure to sewage of diverse ages and thus accounts for the decay of coliphages and pathogens over time. As decay rate constants depend on temperature, the model considers the effect of temperature on the risk-based threshold. When exposure to fresh, unaged sewage contamination occurs, the risk-based water quality threshold for somatic and F+ coliphages is 60 PFU per 100 mL and 30 PFU per 100 mL, respectively, and temperature independent. The risk-based threshold decreases as the contamination ages because, on average, coliphages decay more quickly than norovirus, the pathogen that contributes the most to risk. The decrease in the risk-based threshold with contaminant age is equal to the difference in the first order decay rate constants of coliphages and norovirus. Since coliphage decay rate constants are larger at 25 °C than at 15 °C, and norovirus decay rate constants are a weak function of temperature, risk-based thresholds decrease more quickly with age at 25 °C than at 15 °C. For the common case where the age of contamination is unknown, the risk-based threshold for both coliphages is between ∼1 PFU per 100 mL and ∼10 PFU per 100 mL, depending on model assumptions. Future work can apply this QMRA framework for identifying risk-based thresholds for coliphages from different hazards (treated wastewater or animal feces) or from mixtures of contamination of different ages and sources.</AbstractText>"}

RNA-seq expression profile, miRNA expression profile, and clinical phenotype information of all the samples of TCGA colon adenocarcinoma were downloaded and differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs), differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMis) were identified. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed further and DEMs related with prognosis in the ceRNA network was screened using Cox regression analysis. Risk score models for predicting the prognosis of colon cancer patients were built using these DEMs. A total of 1476 DEMs, 9 DELs, and 243 DEMis between the tumor and normal samples were identified and functional enrichment analyses showed that the DEMs were significantly enriched in the nervous system development, ribosome biogenesis pathways in eukaryotes, and drug metabolism cytochrome P450. Twelve DEMs related with prognosis were screened from the ceRNA network. Thereafter, the risk score models of prognostic DEMs were obtained, involving seven DEMs (<i>SGCG, CLDN23, SLC4A4, CCDC78, SLC17A7, OTOP3,</i> and <i>SMPDL3A</i>).

The endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone BiP was found to promote intestinal epithelial cell survival. Pretreatment of intestinal epithelial cells or mice with the BiP inhibitor HA15 increased cell apoptosis and promoted NEC development. β-arrestin-2 bound to BiP and promoted its polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby facilitating the release of the pro-apoptotic molecule BIK from BiP. Silencing β-arrestin-2 downregulated apoptosis by increasing BiP levels, which suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Resistance to common insecticides is now widespread, and novel classes of insecticides are needed. Entomopathogenic bacteria and their related products play an important role in the management of this pest. In the present work, one bacterial strain was separated from infected pupae of P. xylostella collected from field and its pathogenicity was evaluated. On the basis of the 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, BLASTN, and phylogenetic analysis, this bacterial isolate was identified as Pseudomonas cedrina. Oral administration of P. cedrina at levels above 10,000 CFU/ml gave significant mortality to P. xylostella larvae. The pathogenicity was also observed by reduced longevity and fecundity in adult females. However, when live bacterial cells were removed, the cultured broth lost any pathogenicity. In response to the bacterial infection, P. xylostella expressed antimicrobial and stress-associated genes. A mixture treatment of P. cedrina and Bacillus thuringiensis showed an additive effect on larval mortality of P. xylostella. These results indicated that P. cedrina is an opportunistic entomopathogen without secretion of toxins. Furthermore, the additive effect of P. cedrina and B. thuringiensis provide a new insight to develop new strategy for controlling P. xylostella.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, little is known about how saponin-rich extracts from Holothuria leucospilota can delay and prolong the lifespan of the whole organism. In this study, anti-aging effects of H. leucospilota extracts were studied on Caenorhabditis elegans. NMR analysis revealed that body wall n-butanol-extract of H. leucospilota (BW-BU) is saponin-rich. BW-BU extracts exhibited antioxidant activities by 2,2'-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay (EC<sub>50</sub>  = 10.23 ± 0.12 mg/ml) and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid assay (EC<sub>50</sub>  = 3.91 ± 0.04 mg/ml). BW-BU extracts increased lifespan of L4 and L1 C. elegans (5.92% and 15.76%, respectively), which also increased worm growth, stress resistance, and reduced biomarkers for aging. BW-BU extracts activated DAF-16 nuclear localization and upregulated daf-16 and DAF-16 target genes expression. Taken together, this study revealed the evidences on anti-aging activities of saponin-rich extracts from H. leucospilota, which can extend lifespan of C. elegans via daf-16. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In recent years, age-associated chronic diseases have had a significant impact on quality of life. Many natural compounds exhibit anti-aging activities, especially in sea cucumber, H. leucospilota. Our results indicated that H. leucospilota is good for health. Extracts from H. leucospilota contain a bioactive compound that can be potentially used to promote longevity and disease prevention in aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

At the same time, natural products are rich sources from which to isolate and characterize potential anti-aging compounds. The current study was designed to extract compounds from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. and investigate their in vitro antioxidant and anti-glycation activities, as well as their in vivo effects on aging in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In vitro assays showed that a Pseudomonas sp. PTR-08 extract exhibited the best antioxidant and anti-glycation activities. Further, direct administration of the extract significantly increased yeast longevity, accompanied by induction of the yeast oxidative stress response. Molecular analyses indicated that selected extract dramatically up-regulated the expression of pap1<sup>+</sup>, which encodes the transcriptional factor Pap1 and ctt1<sup>+</sup>, which encodes catalase, following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. In line with these results, catalase activity significantly increased, leading to a decrease in intracellular ROS. In addition, this extract may delay the G1 phase of the yeast cell cycle, leading to an extended lifespan. Moreover, our findings indicated that the extract contains pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-, which substantially promotes anti-aging activity in yeast.

Furthermore, it was reported that diet has significant effects on physiological processes of C. elegans, including reproduction, fat storage, and aging. To reveal novel signaling pathways responsive to different diets, C. elegans and its bacterial diet were used as an interspecies model system to mimic the interaction between host and gut microbiota. Most signaling pathways identified in C. elegans are highly conserved across different species, including humans. A better understanding of these pathways can, therefore, help to develop interventions for human diseases.

For example, predator presence can increase stress hormone levels, which can have physiological costs. Stress exposure accelerates the shortening of telomeres (i.e. the protective caps of chromosomes) and shorter telomeres have been linked to increased mortality risk. However, the effect of perceived predation risk on telomeres is not known. We investigated the effects of continuous predator threat (nesting Eurasian pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum) on telomere dynamics of both adult and partially cross-fostered nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in the wild. Females nesting at owl-inhabited sites showed impaired telomere maintenance between incubation and chick rearing compared to controls, and both males and females ended up with shorter telomeres at owl-inhabited sites in the end of chick rearing. On the contrary, both original and cross-fostered chicks reared in owl sites had consistently longer telomeres during growth than chicks reared at control sites. Thus, predation risk may cause a long-term cost in terms of telomeres for parents but not for their offspring. Predators may therefore affect telomere dynamics of their preys, which could have implications for their ageing rate and consequently for population dynamics.</AbstractText>"}

This report elucidates how age alters different checkpoints of HSF1 activation related to posttranslational modification and protein interactions. When comparing liver extracts from middle aged (12 M) and old (24 M) mice, significant differences are found in HSF1 phosphorylation and acetylation. HSF1 protein levels and messenger RNA decline with age, but its protein levels are stress-inducible and exempt from age-dependent changes. This surprising adaptive change in the stress response has additional implications for aging and chronic physiological stress that might explain an age-dependent dichotomy of HSF1 protein levels that are low in neurodegeneration and elevated in cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

A mild stimulation on mitochondrial biogenesis induced by CR seems to be an important action mode for its benefits. Here, we reported that a component isolated from <i>Rhodiola rosea L</i>., salidroside, delays replicative senescence in human fibroblasts, which is related to its stimulation on mitochondrial biogenesis by activating SIRT1 partly resulted from inhibition on miR-22. Salidroside increased the mitochondrial mass that accompanied an increment of the key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis including PGC-1<i>α</i>, NRF-1, and TFAM and reversed the mitochondrial dysfunction in presenescent 50PD cells, showing a comparable effect to that of resveratrol. SIRT1 is involved in the inducement of mitochondrial biogenesis by salidroside. The declined expression of SIRT1 in 50PD cells compared with the young 30PD cells was prevented upon salidroside treatment. In addition, pretreatment of EX-527, a selective SIRT1 inhibitor, could block the increased mitochondrial mass and decreased ROS production induced by salidroside in 50PD cells, resulting in an accelerated cellular senescence. We further found that salidroside reversed the elevated miR-22 expression in presenescent cells according to a miRNA array analysis and a subsequent qPCR validation. Enforced miR-22 expression by using a Pre-miR-22 lentiviral construct induced the young fibroblasts (30PD) into a senescence state, accompanied with increased senescence-related molecules including p53, p21, p16, and decreased SIRT1 expression, a known target of miR-22. However, salidroside could partly impede the senescence progression induced by lenti-Pre-miR-22. Taken together, our data suggest that salidroside delays replicative senescence by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis partly through a miR22/SIRT1 pathway, which enriches our current knowledge of a salidroside-mediated postpone senility effect and provides a new perspective on the antidecrepitude function of this naturally occurring compound in animals and humans.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gen-Xiang Mao et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Our study is the first to compare both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants as well as oxidative damage between AT and NBS subjects. Twenty two Caucasian children with AT and twelve patients with NBS were studied. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants - glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD) and uric acid (UA); redox status-total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP); and oxidative damage products-8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), advanced glycation end products (AGE), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adducts, and 8-isoprostanes (8-isop) were evaluated in serum or plasma samples. We showed that CAT, SOD and UA were significantly increased, while TAC and FRAP levels were statistically lower in the plasma of AT patients compared to controls. In NBS patients, only CAT activity was significantly elevated, while TAC was significantly decreased as compared to healthy children. We also showed higher oxidative damage to DNA (↑8-OHdG), proteins (↑AGE, ↑AOPP), and lipids (↑4-HNE, ↑8-isop) in both AT and NBS patients. Interestingly, we did not demonstrate any significant differences in the antioxidant defense and oxidative damage between AT and NBS patients. However, in AT children, we showed a positive correlation between 8-OHdG and the α-fetoprotein level as well as a negative correlation between 8-OHdG and IgA. In NBS, AGE was positively correlated with IgM and negatively with the IgG level. Summarizing, we demonstrated an imbalance in cellular redox homeostasis and higher oxidative damage in AT and NBS patients. Despite an increase in the activity/concentration of some antioxidants, the total antioxidant capacity is overwhelmed in children with AT and NBS and predisposes them to more considerable oxidative damage. Oxidative stress may play a major role in AT and NBS phenotype.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Maciejczyk, Heropolitanska-Pliszka, Pietrucha, Sawicka-Powierza, Bernatowska, Wolska-Kusnierz, Pac, Car, Zalewska and Mikoluc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We analyzed whether the anticoagulant dabigatran produces cerebral microhemorrhage (the pathological substrate of MRI-demonstrable cerebral microbleeds) or intracerebral hemorrhage in aged mice with and without hemorrhage-predisposing angiopathy. We studied aged (22 months old) Tg2576 (a model of CAA) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice. Mice received either dabigatran etexilate (DE) (Tg <i>N</i> = 7; WT <i>N</i> = 10) or vehicle (Tg <i>N</i> = 9; WT <i>N</i> = 7) by gavage for 4 weeks. Anticoagulation effects of DE were confirmed using thrombin time assay. No mice experienced intracerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral microhemorrhage analysis, performed using Prussian-blue and H&amp;E staining, showed no significant change in either number or size of cerebral microhemorrhage in DE-treated animals. Analysis of biochemical parameters for endothelial activation (ICAM-1), blood-brain barrier disruption (IgG, claudin-5, fibrinogen), microglial activation (Iba-1), or astrocyte activation (GFAP) showed neither exacerbation nor protective effects of DE in either Tg2576 or WT mice. Our study provides histological and biochemical evidence that aged mice, with or without predisposing factors for brain hemorrhage, tolerate anticoagulation with dabigatran. The absence of dabigatran-induced intracerebral hemorrhage or increased frequency of acute microhemorrhage may provide some reassurance for its use in high-risk patient populations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Michael, Grigoryan, Kilday, Sumbria, Vasilevko, van Ryn, Cribbs, Paganini-Hill and Fisher.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this study, <i>SPF-L</i> mRNA was found to be enriched in the internal reproductive organ (IRO) of virgin males, also expressed relatively stably in virgin males and females, and dietary dsSPF-L-treatments led to reduced MAG protein and Arginine content. Knockdown of <i>NlSPF-L</i> in unmated males did not influence juvenile hormone (JH) III and ecdysteroid titers, however, dsSPF-L-treated mated males had increased JH III titer, and reduced ecdysteroid titer compared to controls.

The experimental females had prolonged pre-oviposition periods and they laid fewer eggs, which suffered reduced hatching rates and population growth index (PGI).

They have a regulatory role of brain functions that are implicated in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, controlling blood-brain barrier permeability and maintaining extracellular homeostasis. Mature astrocytes also express some genes enriched in cell progenitors, suggesting they can retain proliferative potential. Considering heterogeneity of cell population, it is not surprising that their disorders are related to a wide range of different neuro-pathologies. Brain diseases are characterized by the active inflammatory state of the astrocytes, which is usually described as up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In particular, the loss of astrocytes function as a result of cellular senescence could have implications for the neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease, and for the aging brain. Astrocytes can also drive the induction and the progression of the inflammatory state due to their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and that it is strongly related to the disease severity/state. Moreover, they contribute to the altered neuronal activity in several frontal cortex pathologies such as ischemic stroke and epilepsy. There, we describe the current knowledge pertaining to astrocytes' role in brain pathologies and discuss the possibilities to target them as approach toward pharmacological therapies for neuro-pathologies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Siracusa, Fusco and Cuzzocrea.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In clinical settings, patients with BPSD most often do not present with just one symptom. Rather, clusters of symptoms commonly co-occur and can, thus, be grouped into behavioral domains that may ultimately be the result of disruptions in overarching neural circuits. One major BPSD domain routinely identified across patients with AD is the hyperactivity-impulsivity-irritiability-disinhibition-aggression-agitation (HIDA) domain. The HIDA domain represents one of the most difficult sets of symptoms to manage in AD and accounts for much of the burden for caregivers and hospital staff. Although many studies recommend non-pharmacological treatments for HIDA domain symptoms as first-line, they demonstrate little consensus as to what these treatments should be and are often difficult to implement clinically. Certain symptoms within the HIDA domain also do not respond adequately to these treatments, putting patients at risk and necessitating adjunct pharmacological intervention. In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for the HIDA domain and provide suggestions for improving treatment. As epigenetic changes due to both aging and AD cause dysfunction in drug-targeted receptors, we propose that HIDA domain treatments could be enhanced by adjunct strategies that modify these epigenetic alterations and, thus, increase efficacy and reduce side effects. To improve the implementation of non-pharmacological approaches in clinical settings, we suggest that issues regarding inadequate resources and guidance for implementation should be addressed. Finally, we propose that increased monitoring of symptom and treatment progression <i>via</i> novel sensor technology and the 'DICE' (describe, investigate, create, and evaluate) approach may enhance both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the HIDA domain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Keszycki, Fisher and Dong.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Kindling through repeated brief stimulation of limbic structures is a commonly used model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Particularly, extended kindling can induce spontaneous recurrent seizures in several animal species. However, kindling studies in middle-aged, aging, or aged animals remain scarce, and currently, little is known about kindling-induced behavioral changes in middle-aged/aging animals. We therefore attempted to provide more information in this area using a mouse model of extended hippocampal kindling. We conducted experiments in middle-aged mice (C57BL/6, male, 12-14 months of age) to model new-onset epilepsy in adult/aging populations. Mice experienced twice daily hippocampal stimulations or handling manipulations for 60-70 days and then underwent continuous electroencephalogram (EEG)-video monitoring to detect spontaneous recurrent seizures. Extended kindled mice consistently exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures with mean incidences of 6-7 events per day, and these seizures featured EEG discharges and corresponding convulsions. The handling control mice showed neither seizure nor aberrant EEG activity. The two groups of mice underwent the Morris water maze test of spatial learning and memory 1-2 weeks after termination of the kindling stimulation or handling manipulation. During visible platform trials, the kindled mice took a longer distance and required more time than the control mice to find the platform. During hidden platform trials, the kindled mice showed no improvement over 5-day trials in finding the platform whereas the control mice improved significantly. During probe tests in which the hidden platform was removed, the kindled mice spent less time than the controls searching in the correct platform location. There were no significant differences between the kindled and control mice with respect to swim speed or total locomotor activity in an open-field test. Together, these observations indicate that the extended kindled mice with spontaneous recurrent seizures are impaired in spatial learning and memory as assessed by the Morris water maze test. We postulate that the extended hippocampal kindling in middle-aged mice may help explore epileptogenic mechanisms and comorbidities potentially relevant to new-onset temporal lobe epilepsy in adult and aging patients. Limitations and confounds of our present experiments are discussed to improve future examinations of epileptic comorbidities in extended kindled mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Liu, Stover, Sivanenthiran, Chow, Cheng, Liu, Lim, Wu, Weaver, Eubanks, Song and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Traditional use of Alaskan berry preparations in the treatment of skin wounds is recorded but has not been scientifically evaluated. Alaskan wild berries feature diverse phytochemical compositions that contain a variety of bioactive polyphenols exhibiting anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, making them ideal for wound healing interventions and natural anti-aging cosmeceutical formulations. Given increasing interest in identifying biologically active plant constituents for wound care and cosmeceutical applications, the objective of this study was to screen several wild berry species endemic to Alaska and the circumpolar Artic for wound healing and in the crude, polyphenol-enriched, and further fractionated extracts of: <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> (crowberry), <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i> (bog blueberry), and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i> (low-bush cranberry or lingonberry). A cell migration assay with human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) was performed to model promotion of wound closure, revealing that bog blueberry extract most actively promoted migration, whereas divergent effects observed with other berry extracts were related to compositional disparities. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory response variables measured in RAW 264.7 macrophages [reactive oxygen species (ROS), NO production, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (<i>COX-2</i>), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (<i>iNOS</i>) expression] were suppressed by most extracts/fractions, but especially bog blueberry and proanthocyanidin (PAC) fractions. Wild berry germplasm contained abundant complex flavonoid structures such as PAC and anthocyanins (ANCs), associated with enhanced repair and inflammatory resolution in these models. Next, underlying mechanisms by which PACs and bioactive metabolites (B2 dimer and epicatechin) could influence wound repair and tissue regeneration were examined. PAC metabolites promoted scratch-wound closure and appeared to exert the highest impacts on early stages of wound healing through stimulating mitochondrial bioenergetics (basal respiration, ATP production, and maximum respiratory capacity) and upregulating expression of important extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (integrin-ß1 and collagen type I α2 chain). Targeting cellular bioenergetics and integrin-mediated cell-ECM signaling with bioactives from Alaskan wild berries shows considerable therapeutic promise to treat chronic skin wounds and inflammatory skin disorders, as well as more generally to support regenerative healing responses and restore function in a variety of tissue and organ settings after injury or aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Esposito, Overall, Grace, Komarnytsky and Lila.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Despite a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to the appearance of major pathological hallmarks (<i>senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles</i>), effective treatments are still lacking. Sporadic AD forms (<i>98% of all cases</i>) are multifactorial, and a panoply of risk factors have been identified. While the major risk factor is aging, growing evidence suggests that chronic stress or stress-related disorders increase the probability to develop AD. An early dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis or stress axis) has been observed in patients. The direct consequence of such perturbation is an oversecretion of glucocorticoids (GC) associated with an impairment of its receptors (glucocorticoid receptors, GR). These steroids hormones easily penetrate the brain and act in synergy with excitatory amino acids. An overexposure could be highly toxic in limbic structures (<i>prefrontal cortex and hippocampus</i>) and contribute in the cognitive decline occurring in AD. GC and GR dysregulations seem to be involved in lots of functions disturbed in AD and a vicious cycle appears, where AD induces HPA axis dysregulation, which in turn potentiates the pathology. This review article presents some preclinical and clinical studies focusing on the HPA axis hormones and their receptors to fight AD. Due to its primordial role in the maintenance of homeostasis, the HPA axis appears as a key-actor in the etiology of AD and a prime target to tackle AD by offering multiple angles of action.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Canet, Hernandez, Zussy, Chevallier, Desrumaux and Givalois.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Human studies revealed that aging decreases sleep efficiency and reduces the total sleep time, the time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and the delta power (1-4 Hz) during sleep; however, some studies of sleep and aging in mice reported opposing results. The aim of our work is to estimate how features of sleep-wake state in mice during aging could correspond to age-dependent changes observed in human. In this study, we investigated the sleep/wake cycle in young (3 months old) and older (12 months old) C57BL/6 mice using local-field potentials (LFPs). We found that older adult mice sleep more than young ones but only during the dark phase of sleep-wake cycle. Sleep fragmentation and sleep during the active phase (dark phase of cycle), homologous to naps, were higher in older mice. Older mice show a higher delta power in frontal cortex, which was accompanied with similar trend for age differences in slow wave density. We also investigated regional specificity of sleep-wake electrographic activities and found that globally posterior regions of the cortex show more rapid eye movement (REM) sleep whereas somatosensory cortex displays more often SWS patterns. Our results indicate that the effects of aging on the sleep-wake activities in mice occur mainly during the dark phase and the electrode location strongly influence the state detection. Despite some differences in sleep-wake cycle during aging between human and mice, some features of mice sleep share similarity with human sleep during aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Soltani, Chauvette, Bukhtiyarova, Lina, Dubé, Seigneur, Carrier and Timofeev.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is expressed in several distinct subcellular compartments and mediates the effects of nutrients, growth factors, and stress on cell growth. However, the contributions of these various regulators to DAergic cell death have been demonstrated mainly in culture with serum, which is known to dramatically influence endogenous growth rate and toxin susceptibility through nutrient and growth factor signaling. Therefore, we compared neurotoxicity induced by the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone (ROT, 5 or 10 μM for 24 h) in SH-SY5Y cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% FBS, or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, serum-free). In addition, C57BL/6J mice were injected with 12 μg ROT into the right striatum, and brains examined by histology and Western blotting 2 weeks later for evidence of DAergic cell death and the underlying signaling mechanisms. ROT dose-dependently reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability in all serum groups without a significant effect of serum concentration. ROT injection also significantly reduced immunoreactivity for the DAergic cell marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in both the mouse striatum and SNpc. Western blotting revealed that ROT inhibited TH and Parkin expression while increasing α-syn and PINK1 expression in both SH-SY5Y cells and injected mice, consistent with disruption of mitochondrial function. Moreover, expression levels of the mTOR signaling pathway components mTORC, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ULK1, and ATG13 were altered in ROT-induced PD. Further, serum level influenced mTOR signaling in the absence of ROT and the changes in response to ROT. Signs of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and altered expression of tethering proteins mediating mitochondria-associated ER contacts (MAMs) were also altered concomitant with ROT-induced neurodegeneration. Taken together, this study demonstrates that complex mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mTOR nutrient-sensing pathways, ER stress, and disrupted MAM protein dynamics are involved in DAergic neurodegeneration in response to ROT.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ramalingam, Huh and Lee.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In adults, deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several age-related phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as compared to adults. To address this gap, we aimed to develop a highly accurate, noninvasive, biological measure of age specific to pediatric samples using buccal epithelial cell DNAm. We gathered 1,721 genome-wide DNAm profiles from 11 different cohorts of typically developing individuals aged 0 to 20 y old.

Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB- and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are linked not only to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Taken together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history-in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.</AbstractText>"}

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in many copies per cell and is inherited through the maternal germline. In addition, mutations in the mtDNA will give rise to heteroplasmy, the coexistence of different mtDNA variants within a single cell, whose levels can vary considerably between cells, organs or organisms. The inheritance and subsequent accumulation of deleterious variants are the cause of severe progressive mitochondrial disorders and play a role in many other conditions, including aging, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we discuss the processes that give rise to cell-to-cell variability in mtDNA composition, focussing on somatic mtDNA segregation and on less conventional sources of heteroplasmy: non-maternal inheritance and mtDNA recombination. Understanding how mtDNA variants and mutations emerge and evolve within an organism is of crucial importance to prevent and cure mitochondrial disease and can potentially impact more common aging-associated conditions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, genetic and environmental determinants of MDD remain mostly unknown. Here, we investigated whether and how the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may contribute to MDD. We first examined the phenotype of PAI-1 knockout (PAI-1-/-) and wild-type (PAI-1+/+) male mice with a range of behavioral tests assessing depressive-like behaviors (n = 276). We next investigated the mechanisms relating PAI-1 to MDD using molecular, biochemical and pharmacological analyzes. We demonstrate here that PAI-1 plays a key role in depression by a mechanism independent of the tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) - Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) axis, but associated with impaired metabolisms of serotonin and dopamine. Our data also reveal that PAI-1 interferes with therapeutic responses to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (escitalopram, fluoxetine). We thus highlight a new genetic preclinical model of depression, with the lack of PAI-1 as a factor of predisposition to MDD. Altogether, these original data reveal that PAI-1 should be now considered as a key player of MDD and as a potential target for the development of new drugs to cure depressive patients resistant to current treatments.</AbstractText>"}

Greater hypoxemia (sleep time &lt;90% saturation) was associated with increasing carotid intima-media thickness in younger (0.028±0.014 mm) but not in older individuals (-0.001±0.013 mm; <i>P</i> interaction=0.106). Self-reported snoring was not associated with carotid atherosclerosis. In assessing race-specific outcomes, greater hypoxemia was associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness in blacks (0.049±0.017 mm; <i>P</i> interaction=0.033). Conclusions- In this large multiethnic population-based sample, sleep disturbances are associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in both men and women, particularly in those &lt;68 years of age. The mechanisms underlying the association between SA and carotid atherosclerosis may differ for carotid plaque and carotid intima-media thickness.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we optimized the hybridization processes of an array for fission yeast. Compared to the first version of the array (11 µm, 100K) consisting of three sectors with probe pairs (perfect match and mismatch), the second version (11 µm, 48K) could represent ~10,000 up-/down-tags in quadruplicate along with 1,508 negative controls in quadruplicate and a single set of 1,000 unique negative controls at random dispersed positions without mismatch pairs. For PCR, the optimal annealing temperature (maximizing yield and minimizing extra bands) was 58°C for both tags. Intriguingly, up-tags required 3 higher amounts of blocking oligonucleotides than down-tags. A 1:1 mix ratio between up- and down-tags was satisfactory. A lower temperature (25°C) was optimal for cultivation instead of a normal temperature (30°C) because of extra temperature-sensitive mutants in a subset of the deletion library. Activation of frozen pooled cells for &gt;1 day showed better resolution of intensity than no activation. A tag intensity analysis showed that tag(s) of 4,316 of the 4,526 strains tested were represented at least once; 3,706 strains were represented by both tags, 4,072 strains by up-tags only, and 3,950 strains by down-tags only.

Musca domestica, a well-known pest of medical and veterinary importance worldwide, is one of the important non-target insect species present in the rice farming system. In this study, five strains of M. domestica were exclusively collected from rice fields in major rice cultivated areas of Punjab, Pakistan, and evaluated for the presence of insecticide resistance against nine commonly used insecticides in the rice farming system. Moreover, the performance of life-history traits was also studied. Compared with a Lab-susceptible reference strain of M. domestica, all the field strains exhibited moderate levels of resistance to carbofuran (RRs = 27.96-46.00 fold) and cartap hydrochloride (RRs = 31.48-48.21 fold), low to moderate levels of resistance to gamma-cyhalothrin (RRs = 19.00-43.00 fold), chlorantraniliprole (RRs = 11.90-27.10 fold), monomehypo (RRs = 14.38-25.84 fold), and fipronil (RRs = 13.23-40.15 fold), low levels of resistance to triazophos (RRs = 11.13-19.83 fold), and very low to low levels of resistance (RRs = 7.83-13.28 fold) to flonicamid.

Alterations in physiological functions, such as inflammatory and metabolic, have been described in patients with depression. However, little is known on the association between depression symptom course and metabolic and inflammation dysregulation. This study aimed to depict the course of depression symptoms while ageing, taking into consideration inter-individual heterogeneity. Moreover, it intended to study the associations between inflammatory and metabolic risk profiles and symptom trajectories. To do so, data from 13,203 adults aged 50-90 years (52.75% women; mean age at baseline = 65.07, SD = 10.00) were used. Blood sample and blood pressure measures were taken from 1536 participants (56.58% women; mean age at baseline = 61.73 years, sd = 7.64). Depression symptoms were assessed every two years across a 10-year follow-up. Trajectories were identified by means of latent class mixed modelling. Inflammation and metabolic risk profile scores were obtained from plasma and diagnostic-based indicators in the follow-up, using a robust latent-factor approach. Multigroup modelling was used to study the associations between the profiles and symptom trajectories. As a result, three heterogeneous trajectories of symptoms were identified (low-symptom, moderate-symptom and high-symptom trajectory). Participants depicting a high-symptom trajectory showed the greatest inflammation profile score and high metabolic risk. Moderate-symptom trajectory was also related to high inflammation and metabolic risk. To sum up, at-risk trajectories of symptoms were associated with high inflammation and risk of metabolic diseases. This study provides valuable evidence to advance personalised medicine and mental health precision, considering person-specific profiles and physiological concomitants.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

The adsorption mechanism of different aged PS toward atorvastatin (ATV) and amlodipine (AML) and the role of PS-derived intermediates in adsorption process were investigated. Results showed that the adsorption of pristine PS toward pharmaceuticals relied on hydrophobic and π-π interaction, while for aged PS, electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding controlled the adsorption. The study revealed that the intermediates released from aging process in high concentration (TOC of 10 mg/L) significantly decreased the adsorption of ATV (10 mg/L) on PS (5.0 g/L) but increased the adsorption of AML (10 mg/L). However, those intermediates at environmental concentration (0.1 mg/L) exhibited low effects on adsorption of pharmaceuticals (1.0 mg/L) on MPs (0.5 g/L of PS).

To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to investigate whether the antioxidant properties of O<sub>3</sub> can ameliorate age-associated structural alterations of the cerebral cortex. Ozone administration (at a dose of 0.7mg/kg intraperitonially, three times a week for eight weeks) produced significant downregulation of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and upregulation of glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) within the frontal cortex of aged rats. Sections of the frontal cortex from adult and aged rats were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed using light microscopy. In addition, quantitative immunohistochemical assessments of the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), caspase-3, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ki67 and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were performed. Our results revealed the beneficial effect of O<sub>3</sub> in improving the neurodegenerative changes of the cerebral cortex of aged rats. Moreover, this study clarified that O<sub>3</sub> exerted its effects via reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, gliosis as well as improving neurogenesis and cholinergic plasticity.

Autoantigens exposure and kidney infiltration of naive T cells lead to their local development. Furthermore, losing peripheral immune tolerance towards kidney antigens, will result in IMN. The growing findings about different immune system factors, cells and molecular mechanism have also revealed new pathways of pathogenesis and diagnosis approaches, such as personalized medicine in MN patients. This review aims to discuss the recent findings in adaptive immune cells, and distinguishes between intact and undone researches about pathogenesis and molecular signaling pathways of immune system in MN disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

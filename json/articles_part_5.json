Old people have an increased risk of developing LRTIs compared to young adults. The prevalence of LRTIs in the elderly population is not only related to underlying diseases and aging itself, but also to a variety of clinical issues, such as history of hospitalization, previous antibacterial therapy, mechanical ventilation, antibiotic resistance. These factors mentioned above have led to an increase in the prevalence and mortality of LRTIs in the elderly, and new medical strategies targeting LRTIs in this population are urgently needed. After a systematic review of the current randomized controlled trials and related studies, we recommend novel pharmacotherapies that demonstrate advantages for the management of LRTIs in people over the age of 65. We also briefly reviewed current medications for respiratory communicable diseases in the elderly. Various sources of information were used to ensure all relevant studies were included. We searched Pubmed, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and ClinicalTrials.gov. Strengths and limitations of these drugs were evaluated based on whether they have novelty of mechanism, favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles, avoidance of interactions and intolerance, simplicity of dosing, and their ability to cope with challenges which was mainly evaluated by the primary and secondary endpoints. The purpose of this review is to recommend the most promising antibiotics for treatment of LRTIs in the elderly (both in hospital and in the outpatient setting) based on the existing results of clinical studies with the novel antibiotics, and to briefly review current medications for respiratory communicable diseases in the elderly, aiming to a better management of LRTIs in clinical practice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Liu, Zhang, Zhao, Liu, Hu and Dong.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together with an n-back task to measure brain plasticity in healthy middle-aged adults following an 8-week adaptive online verbal WM training. Participants performed 32 sessions of this training on their personal computers. In addition, we assessed direct effects of the training by applying a verbal WM task before and after the training. Participants (mean age 55.85 ± 4.24 years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to the experimental group (<i>n</i> = 30) or an active control group (<i>n</i> = 27). Training resulted in an activity decrease in regions known to be involved in verbal WM (i.e., fronto-parieto-cerebellar circuitry and subcortical regions), indicating that the brain became potentially more efficient after the training. These activation decreases were associated with a significant performance improvement in the n-back task inside the scanner reflecting considerable practice effects. In addition, there were training-associated direct effects in the additional, external verbal WM task (i.e., HAWIE-R digit span forward task), and indicating that the training generally improved performance in this cognitive domain. These results led us to conclude that even at advanced age cognitive training can improve WM capacity and increase neural efficiency in specific regions or networks.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Emch, Ripp, Wu, Yakushev and Koch.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The onset of AD is insidious, gradually progressive and multifactorial. The recent accumulated scientific evidences suggests that the pathological changes resemble the autoimmune-driven self-sustaining inflammatory process as a result of prolonged oxidative stress and immune dyshomeostasis. Apart from aging, during life span various other factors-mainly environmental, lifestyle, chronic stress, polymicrobial infections and neuroendocrine functions-affect the immune system. Here, we provide crosstalk among 'trigger insults/inflammatory stimulus' i.e., polymicrobial infection, chronic stress, pro-inflammatory diet and cholinergic signaling to put forward a 'Systemic Immune Dyshomeostasis' model as to connect the events leading to AD development and progression. Our model implicates altered cholinergic signaling and suggests pathological stages with various modifiable risk factors and triggers at different chronological age and stage of cognitive decline. The search of specific autoantibodies for AD which may serve as the suitable blood/CSF biomarkers should be actively pursued for the early diagnosis of AD. The preventive and therapeutic strategies should be directed towards maintaining the normal functioning of the immune system throughout the life span and specific modulation of the immune responses in the brain depending on the stage of changes in brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Talwar, Kushwaha, Gupta and Agarwal.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the AD brain, microglial activation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators both induce amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling have been implicated in AD development through their effects on neuroinflammation and microglial activation. The bee venom soluble phospholipase A2 (bv-sPLA2) enzyme is known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-immune effects. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of bv-sPLA2 on memory deficiency in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of AD. We examined whether bv-sPLA2 (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg by i.p. injection three times for 1 week) could inhibit neuroinflammation and memory impairment in LPS-treated mice (250 μg/kg by i.p. injection daily for 1 week). We also assessed the effects of bv-sPLA2 administration (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/ml) on LPS (1 μg/ml)-treated microglial BV-2 cells. In the LPS-injected mouse brain, sPLA2 treatment rescued memory dysfunction and decreased Aβ levels, through the downregulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and decreased the expression of inflammatory proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the LPS-mediated increase in inflammatory protein expression was attenuated bv-sPLA2 treatment in BV-2 cells. Treatment with bv-sPLA2 also downregulated signaling by NF-κB, which is considered to be an important factor in the regulation of neuroinflammatory and amyloidogenic responses, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Additionally, co-treatment with NF-κB (5 μM) and bv-sPLA2 (0.1 μg/ml) exerted more marked anti-inflammatory effects, compared to bv-sPLA2 treatment alone.

Given that research in this area is limited, a better understanding of associated factors with physical frailty could provide a focused screening method and facilitate early intervention in PD. <b>Methods</b>: Seventy-six patients with idiopathic PD were recruited and Fried's criteria of physical frailty were used to group all participants. Comprehensive cognitive tests and clinical characteristics were measured, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to explore the relationship between clinical factors or neuropsychological functions. <b>Results</b>: Twenty-nine patients with PD (38%) exhibited physical frailty.

However, the functional correlation of these findings has not been explored. We performed an electrophysiological investigation of hind limb nerves in SHR of both genders in different ages. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. Electrophysiological recordings and determination of motor (MCV) and sensory (SCV) nerve conduction velocity were performed in the same animals at four different ages: 5, 8, 20 and 40 weeks after birth. Comparisons were made between ages, genders and animal strain. We showed a continuous body weight increase in adult life in all animals studied. MCV got stable at 20-week old hypertensive animals and continued to increase in normotensive ones. The SCV was constant between the ages of 20 and 40 weeks old in female SHR and decreased in male SHR while it continued to increase in WKY animals. The electrophysiological investigation of the nerves in WKY and SHR from both genders and different ages, associated with morphological and morphometric data from the literature suggest that hypertension affects the nerve function and might corroborate the development of a peripheral neuropathy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Fontanesi, Fazan, Dias, Schiavoni, Marques and Fazan.</CopyrightInformation>"}

These functions are mediated by the interplay of cerebral structures that can be broadly separated into a posterior network (subserving visual and spatial processing) and an anterior network (dedicated to memory and navigation planning). Within these networks, areas such as the hippocampus (HC) are known to be affected by aging and to be associated with cognitive decline and navigation impairments. However, age-related changes in brain connectivity within the spatial navigation network remain to be investigated. For this purpose, we performed a neuroimaging study combining functional and structural connectivity analyses between cerebral regions involved in spatial navigation. Nineteen young (μ = 27 years, σ = 4.3; 10 F) and 22 older (μ = 73 years, σ = 4.1; 10 F) participants were examined in this study. Our analyses focused on the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), the occipital place area (OPA), and the projections into the visual cortex of central and peripheral visual fields, delineated from independent functional localizers. In addition, we segmented the HC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) from anatomical images. Our results show an age-related decrease in functional connectivity between low-visual areas and the HC, associated with an increase in functional connectivity between OPA and PPA in older participants compared to young subjects. Concerning the structural connectivity, we found age-related differences in white matter integrity within the navigation brain network, with the exception of the OPA. The OPA is known to be involved in egocentric navigation, as opposed to allocentric strategies which are more related to the hippocampal region. The increase in functional connectivity between the OPA and PPA may thus reflect a compensatory mechanism for the age-related alterations around the HC, favoring the use of the preserved structural network mediating egocentric navigation. Overall, these findings on age-related differences of functional and structural connectivity may help to elucidate the cerebral bases of spatial navigation deficits in healthy and pathological aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ramanoël, York, Le Petit, Lagrené, Habas and Arleo.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS), we investigated measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). TBSS was used to create a white matter skeleton that was then used to analyze white matter changes (indexed by FA, AD, RD, and MD) with age and language performance. Results focused primarily on significant relationships (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, cluster-wise FDR corrected for multiple comparisons) in the canonical language white matter pathways. We found a diffuse linear <i>decrease</i> with age in global white matter FA and a significant focal <i>increase</i> in FA with age within the bilateral superior cerebellar peduncles (SCPs). We observed that increased BNT scores were associated with increased FA within the left SLF, and within the posterior and antero-lateral portions of the right inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). Increased SFT and PPVT scores were associated with increased FA within the posterior portion of the right IFOF and increased FA within the left body of the corpus callosum was associated with lower COWAT scores. We found no association between FA and BDAE. MD, RD, and AD, were found to be inversely proportional to FA within the IFOF, with AD showing a negative correlation with SFT, and RD and MD showing a negative correlation with BNT. There was no association between CI-BDAE and any of the white matter measures. Significant differences between sexes included more pronounced FA decrease with age within the right SLF in males vs. females; there were no differences in language performance scores between sexes. We also found that there was no decline in language testing scores with increasing age in our cohort. Taken together, our findings of varying relationships between DTI metrics and language function within multiple regions of the non-dominant IFOF suggest that more robust language networks with bilateral structural connectivity may contribute to better overall language functioning, regardless of age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Houston, Allendorfer, Nenert, Goodman and Szaflarski.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this study, we aimed to investigate the ability of mitochondrial stress response in senescent cells to cope with the accumulation of mitochondrial unfolded proteins induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and to understand the relevant molecular mechanisms. We report here that senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) and senescence marker protein-30 (SMP-30), commonly used replicative senescence biomarkers, changed remarkably between population doubling (PD) 25 (exponentially growing cells) and PD50 (senescent cells) of MRC-5 fibroblasts.

In addition, decreased expression of stromal interacting molecule 1-Orai1-mediated store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following an declined intracellular calcium level after 2 mM calcium treatment together with H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> addition, implying impairment of calcium influx in senescent MRC-5 during H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -induced injury. These findings suggest that senescent fibroblasts expressed higher vulnerability to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -induced injury involving the imbalance of calcium homeostasis and impaired mitochondrial nuclear communication. This may provide useful information for the future development of therapeutic agents to prevent the adverse effects of aging on cells and the potential for treatment of proteinopathies in the elderly.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

We recently reported that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an upstream component of the p53 responses to DNA damage. BTK binds to and phosphorylates p53 and MDM2, which results in increased p53 activity. Consistent with this, blocking BTK impairs p53-induced senescence. This suggests that sustained BTK inhibition could have an effect on organismal aging by reducing the presence of senescent cells in tissues. Here, we show that ibrutinib, a clinically approved covalent inhibitor of BTK, prolonged the maximum lifespan of a Zmpste24<sup>-/-</sup> progeroid mice, which also showed a reduction in general age-related fitness loss. Importantly, we found that certain brain functions were preserved, as seen by reduced anxiety-like behaviour and better long-term spatial memory. This was concomitant to a decrease in the expression of specific markers of senescence in the brain, which confirms a lower accumulation of senescent cells after BTK inhibition. Our data show that blocking BTK has a modest increase in lifespan in Zmpste24<sup>-/-</sup> mice and protects them from a decline in brain performance. This suggests that specific inhibitors could be used in humans to treat progeroid syndromes and prevent the age-related degeneration of organs such as the brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

By screening silver-catalyzed GDEs over a range of applied current densities, an inverse correlation was observed between carbon monoxide selectivity and the electrochemical double-layer capacitance, a proxy for wetted electrode area. Plotting current-dependent performance as a function of cumulative charge led to data collapse onto a single sigmoidal curve indicating that the passage of faradaic current accelerates flooding. It was hypothesized that high cathode alkalinity, driven by both initial electrolyte conditions and cathode half-reactions, promotes carbonate formation and precipitation which, in turn, facilitates electrolyte permeation. This mechanism was reinforced by the observations that post-test GDEs retain less hydrophobicity than pristine materials and that water-rinsing and drying electrodes temporarily recovers peak selectivity.

Mounting evidence points to ω-6 PUFA excess limiting metabolic and cognitive processes that define longevity in humans. When chosen during pregnancy, ω-6 PUFA-enriched 'Western' diets can reprogram maternal bodily metabolism with maternal nutrient supply precipitating the body-wide imprinting of molecular and cellular adaptations at the level of long-range intercellular signaling networks in the unborn fetus. Even though unfavorable neurological outcomes are amongst the most common complications of intrauterine ω-6 PUFA excess, cellular underpinnings of life-long modifications to brain architecture remain unknown. Here, we show that nutritional ω-6 PUFA-derived endocannabinoids desensitize CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors, thus inducing epigenetic repression of transcriptional regulatory networks controlling neuronal differentiation. We found that cortical neurons lose their positional identity and axonal selectivity when mouse fetuses are exposed to excess ω-6 PUFAs in utero. Conversion of ω-6 PUFAs into endocannabinoids disrupted the temporal precision of signaling at neuronal CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors, chiefly deregulating Stat3-dependent transcriptional cascades otherwise required to execute neuronal differentiation programs. Global proteomics identified the immunoglobulin family of cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) as direct substrates, with DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility profiling uncovering epigenetic reprogramming at &gt;1400 sites in neurons after prolonged cannabinoid exposure. We found anxiety and depression-like behavioral traits to manifest in adult offspring, which is consistent with genetic models of reduced IgCAM expression, to suggest causality for cortical wiring defects. Overall, our data uncover a regulatory mechanism whose disruption by maternal food choices could limit an offspring's brain function for life.</AbstractText>"}

Folia pharmacologica Japonica","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>As Japan enters into an aging society, aged patients with chief complaint of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have increased. The most common cause of LUTS in men older than 50 years is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In particular, LUTS associated with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms was reported to have a significant negative impact on patient quality of life (QOL). In clinical practice, monotherapy with α1-blockers or PDE5 inhibitors is widely employed for the initial management of BPH accompanied by OAB (BPH/OAB). However, storage symptoms may persist in some patients. In patients with residual OAB symptoms despite α1-blocker or PDE5 inhibitor monotherapy, the addition of an anticholinergic agent or a β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonist is recommended by the BPH guidelines. Although both agents have been shown to effectively improve OAB symptoms and bladder storage functions, it remains unclear which type of add-on therapy, anticholinergic agents or β3-AR agonists, is most effective for alleviating OAB symptoms and storage functions. Recently, detrusor underactivity (DU) is also considered to be a common cause of non-neurogenic LUTS in men. DU has been reported to be present in 9%-48% of men undergoing urodynamic evaluation for non-neurogenic LUTS. DU can lead to adverse health effects, in addition to significant burden and decreased QOL. Thus, development of a safe and effective treatment for patients with LUTS induced by DU is an urgent issue at present. In this paper, we will introduce most recent findings of curative drugs for LUTS, especially BPH/OAB and DU in clinical practice.</AbstractText>"}

However, the contribution of AT B cells in immunometabolism during aging is unexplored. Here, we show that aging is associated with an expansion of a unique population of resident non-senescent aged adipose B cells (AABs) found in fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs). AABs are transcriptionally distinct from splenic age-associated B cells (ABCs) and show greater expansion in female mice. Functionally, whole-body B cell depletion restores proper lipolysis and core body temperature maintenance during cold stress. Mechanistically, the age-induced FALC formation, AAB, and splenic ABC expansion is dependent on the Nlrp3 inflammasome. Furthermore, AABs express IL-1R, and inhibition of IL-1 signaling reduces their proliferation and increases lipolysis in aging. These data reveal that inhibiting Nlrp3-dependent B cell accumulation can be targeted to reverse metabolic impairment in aging AT.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Protein persulfidation (S-sulfhydration) is a post-translational modification of reactive cysteine residues, which modulate protein structure and/or function. Persulfides are difficult to label and study due to their reactivity and similarity with cysteine. Here, we report a facile strategy for chemoselective persulfide bioconjugation using dimedone-based probes, to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust persulfide labeling in biological samples with broad utility. Using this method, we show persulfidation is an evolutionarily conserved modification and waves of persulfidation are employed by cells to resolve sulfenylation and prevent irreversible cysteine overoxidation preserving protein function. We report an age-associated decline in persulfidation that is conserved across evolutionary boundaries. Accordingly, dietary or pharmacological interventions to increase persulfidation associate with increased longevity and improved capacity to cope with stress stimuli.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Crown Copyright © 2019.

We investigated age-related differences in MWF in several brain regions in a large cohort of cognitively unimpaired participants, spanning a wide age range. Our results indicate a quadratic, inverted U-shape, relationship between MWF and age in all brain regions investigated, suggesting that myelination continues until middle age followed by decreases at older ages.

The biochemical crosstalk between muscle and bone seems to play a role in OS. We have previously shown that osteocytes produce soluble factors with beneficial effects on muscle and <i>vice versa</i>. Recently, enhanced FGF9 production was observed in the OmGFP66 osteogenic cell line. To test its role in myogenic differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with recombinant FGF9. FGF9 as low as 10 ng/mL inhibited myogenic differentiation, suggesting that FGF9 might be a potential inhibitory factor produced from bone cells with effects on muscle cells. FGF9 (10-50 ng/mL) significantly decreased mRNA expression of <i>MyoG</i> and <i>Mhc</i> while increasing the expression of <i>Myostatin</i>. Consistent with the phenotype, RT-qPCR array revealed that FGF9 (10 ng/mL) increased the expression of <i>Icam1</i> while decreased the expression of <i>Wnt1</i> and <i>Wnt6</i> decreased, respectively. FGF9 decreased caffeine-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of C2C12 myotubes and reduced the expression of genes (i.e. <i>Cacna1s, RyR2, Naftc3</i>) directly associated with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Myogenic differentiation in human skeletal muscle cells was similarly inhibited by FGF9 but required higher doses of 200 ng/mL FGF9. FGF9 was also shown to stimulate C2C12 myoblast proliferation. FGF2 and the FGF9 subfamily members FGF16 and FGF20 also inhibited C2C12 myoblast differentiation and enhanced proliferation. Intriguingly, the differentiation inhibition was independent of proliferation enhancement. These findings suggest that FGF9 may modulate myogenesis via a complex signaling mechanism.</AbstractText>"}

However, its role in the development of cardiac remodeling after pressure overload is unclear. Cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt7-knockout and control mice were subjected to pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction. Cardiac hypertrophy and functions were then examined in these mice. Sirt7 protein expression was increased in myocardial tissue after pressure overload. Transverse aortic constriction-induced increases in heart weight/tibial length were significantly augmented in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt7-knockout mice compared with those of control mice. Histological analysis showed that the cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and fibrosis area were significantly larger in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt7-deficient mice. Cardiac contractile functions were markedly decreased in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt7-deficient mice. Mechanistically, we found that Sirt7 interacted directly with GATA4 and that the exacerbation of phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy by Sirt7 knockdown was decreased by GATA4 knockdown. Sirt7 deacetylated GATA4 in cardiomyocytes and regulated its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, we demonstrated that treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide, a known key NAD<sup>+</sup> intermediate, ameliorated agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophies in a Sirt7-dependent manner in vitro. Sirt7 deficiency in cardiomyocytes promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. Sirt7 exerts its antihypertrophic effect by interacting with and promoting deacetylation of GATA4.</AbstractText>"}

We evaluated the association between a comprehensive set of measures of microvascular dysfunction and cognitive performance in the population-based Maastricht Study. We used cross-sectional data including 3011 participants (age 59.5±8.2; 48.9% women; 26.5% type 2 diabetes mellitus [oversampled by design]). Measures of microvascular dysfunction included magnetic resonance imaging features of cerebral small vessel disease, plasma biomarkers of microvascular dysfunction, albuminuria, flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response and heat-induced skin hyperemia. These measures were summarized into a microvascular dysfunction composite score. Cognitive domains assessed were memory, processing speed, and executive function. A cognitive function score was calculated as the sum of the scores on these 3 cognitive domains. The microvascular dysfunction score was associated with a worse cognitive function score (standardized β, -0.087 [95% CI, -0.127 to -0.047]), independent of age, education level, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, total/HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, lipid-modifying medication, prior cardiovascular disease, depression and plasma biomarkers of low-grade inflammation. The fully adjusted β-coefficient of the association between the microvascular dysfunction score and the cognitive function score was equivalent to 2 (range, 1-3) years of aging for each SD higher microvascular dysfunction score. The microvascular dysfunction score was associated with worse memory and processing speed but not with worse executive function.

Proper muscle regeneration requires enough number of satellite cells. Recent studies have suggested that the number of satellite cells in skeletal muscle declines as we age, leading to the impairment of muscle regeneration in older population. Our earlier study demonstrated that zinc finger transcription factor early growth response 3 (Egr3) plays an important role for maintaining the number of myoblasts, suggesting that age-related decrease in muscle satellite cell should be associated with the expression levels of Egr3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aging would alter the Egr3 expression in satellite cells. A couple groups of male C57BL/6J mice were examined in this study: young (3 Mo) and old (17 Mo). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the satellite cell number decreased in normal and injured muscles of old mice. In fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated muscle satellite cells from normal and injured muscles, the mRNA expression of Egr3 was significantly decreased with age regardless of injury. In harmony with these results, Pax7 mRNA levels also decreased in the satellite cells from old mice. Alternatively, inhibition of Egr3 expression by shRNA decreased Pax7 protein expression in cultured myoblasts. These results suggest that Egr3 is associated with the age-related decline of muscle satellite cells in older population. Also, Egr3 might be implicated in the regulation of Pax7. Therefore, the loss of Egr3 expression may elucidate attenuated MSCs function and muscle regeneration in older age.</AbstractText>"}

A previous epidemiological study has indicated that arsenic levels in blood were higher in arthritis patients compared to age-matched control subjects. Bone is known as an important arsenic store compartment in the body. Arsenic exposure has been suggested to promote senescence in human mesenchymal stem cells that may affect the balance of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. The toxicological effect and mechanism of arsenic exposure on articular chondrocytes still remain unclear. Here, we investigated the arsenic-induced senescence in cultured human articular chondrocytes and long-term arsenic-exposed rat articular cartilage. Arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; 1-5 μM) significantly induced senescence in human articular chondrocytes by increasing senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity and protein expression of p16, p53, and p21. Arsenic induced the phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins. The inhibitors of p38 and JNK significantly reversed the arsenic-induced chondrocyte senescence. Arsenic could also trigger the induction of GATA4-NF-κB signaling and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) by increasing IL-1α, IL-1β, TGF-β, TNF-α, CCL2, PAI-1, and MMP13 mRNA expression. The increased cartilage senescence and abrasion were also observed in a rat model long-term treatment with arsenic (0.05 and 0.5 ppm) in drinking water for 36 weeks as compared to age-matched control rats. The phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and the induction of GATA4-NF-κB signaling and SASP were enhanced in the rat cartilages.

This behaviour was not observed under saturated-unsaturated flow, as the total amounts retained were similar in both the S and S + GC columns. Prosulfocarb was primarily retained in the first segment of the S (&gt;28%) and S + GC (&gt;43%) columns under all conditions.

Accumulating evidence has shown that misfolded fibrillar α-Syn is transmitted from cell-to-cell, a phenomenon that correlates with clinical progression of the disease. We previously showed that deleting the MAP3 kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which is a central player linking oxidative stress with neuroinflammation, mitigates the phenotype of α-Syn transgenic mice. However, whether ASK1 impacts pathology and disease progression induced by recombinant α-Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) remains unknown. Here, we compared the neuropathological and behavioral phenotype of ASK1 knock-out mice with that of wild-type mice following intrastriatal injections of α-Syn PFF. At 6 months post-injections, ASK1 null mice exhibited reduced amount of phosphorylated α-Syn aggregates in the striatum and cortex, and less pronounced degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Additionally, the neuroinflammatory reaction to α-Syn PFF injection and propagation seen in wild-type mice was attenuated in ASK1 knock-out animals. These neuropathological markers were associated with better behavioral performance. These data suggest that ASK1 plays an important role in pathological α-Syn fibril transmission and, consequently, may impact disease progression. These findings collectively support inhibiting ASK1 as a disease modifying therapeutic strategy for Parkinson disease and related α-synucleinopathies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Early loss of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of ascending noradrenergic (NA) projections, is an important feature of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that NA afferents provide trophic support for vulnerable mDA neurons. We demonstrate that depriving mDA neurons of NA input increases postnatal apoptosis and decreases cell survival in young adult rodents, with relative sparing of calbindin-positive subpopulations known to be resistant to degeneration in PD. As a mechanism, we propose that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates anterograde survival effects of LC inputs to mDA neurons. We demonstrate that the LC is rich in BDNF mRNA in postnatal and young adult brains. Early postnatal NA denervation reduces both BDNF protein and activation of TrkB receptors in the ventral midbrain. Furthermore, overexpression of BDNF in NA afferents in transgenic mice increases mDA neuronal survival. Finally, increasing NA activity in primary cultures of mDA neurons improves survival, an effect that is additive or synergistic in the presence of different concentrations of BDNF. Taken together, our results point to a novel mechanism whereby LC afferents couple BDNF effects and NA activity to provide anterograde trophic support for vulnerable mDA neurons. Early loss of NA activity and anterograde neurotrophin support may contribute to degeneration of vulnerable neurons in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

At present, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI acquisition is the most commonly used CVR method due to its high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and relatively straightforward processing. However, large variations in CVR across subjects and across different sessions of the same subject are often observed, which can cloud the ability of this promising measure in detecting diseases or monitoring treatment responses. The present work aims to identify the physiological components underlying the observed variability in CVR data. When studying the association between CVR value and the subject's CO<sub>2</sub> levels in a total of N = 253 healthy participants, we found that CVR was lower in individuals with a higher basal end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, EtCO<sub>2</sub> (slope = -0.0036 ± 0.0008%/mmHg<sup>2</sup>, p &lt; 0.001), or with a greater EtCO<sub>2</sub> change (ΔEtCO<sub>2</sub>) with hypercapnic condition (slope = -0.0072 ± 0.0018%/mmHg<sup>2</sup>, p &lt; 0.001). In a within-subject setting, when studying the CVR difference between two repeated scans (with repositioning) in relation to the corresponding differences in basal EtCO<sub>2</sub> and ΔEtCO<sub>2</sub> (n = 11), it was found that CVR values were lower if the basal EtCO<sub>2</sub> or ΔEtCO<sub>2</sub> during that particular scan session was greater. The present work suggests that basal physiological state and the level of hypercapnic stimulus intensity should be considered in application studies of CVR in order to reduce inter-subject and intra-subject variations in the data.

With our study finding that high concentrations of lactic acid can inhibit tumour growth, it is conceivable that the administration of lactic acid could promote antitumour immunity in the context of a tumour vaccine. To test this concept, we studied the antitumour effect of irradiated tumour cells stimulated with lactic acid in mouse xenograft models to potentially improve whole-cell tumour vaccines. In this study, we found that the effects of lactic acid-stimulated tumour cells on dendritic cells (DCs) included enhancing phagocytic function and stimulating maturation and aggregation. Moreover, lactic acid could potentiate the immunogenicity of an irradiated whole-tumour cell vaccine and thus inhibit tumour growth. We further verified that the antitumour immune response was mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, interferon-γ-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers increased in the spleen and lymph nodes of mice immunized with the irradiated lactic acid-stimulated cells.

However the ability to rapidly and accurately recognize unexpected stimuli in a given environment is also crucial and this ability is impaired with age. The present fMRI study aimed at comparing in young and older adults the neural correlates of fast object processing. Patterns of cerebral activity were investigated in response to briefly-presented (100 ms) congruent and incongruent natural scenes. Participants were slower and less accurate when categorizing objects in incongruent relative to congruent contexts. This behavioral cost was notably more pronounced in the older group. Height and multivariate patterns of fMRI activity in context-selective regions were equivalent in both age groups, suggesting preserved processing of coarse scene features in older participants. Incongruent scenes elicited additional activity in the parahippocampal gyrus that possibly reflected simultaneous activation of rarely co-occurring neural representations. Contextual effects were observed in object-selective cortex for the young group only, and may be driven by detection of mismatch between actually perceived and previously-experienced associations. In the older group exclusively, increased bilateral prefrontal and left fusiform activity in response to incongruent scenes was observed. However this supplemental activity was not found to efficiently contribute to improve task performance in difficult visual conditions. Altogether these results suggest age-related changes in the interaction between object- and context-processing pathways, that may subserve impairment in fast identification of unexpected objects in natural scenes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with controls, PFX- demonstrated enlarged fourth ventricles, whereas PFX+ displayed enlargement in both third and fourth ventricles, CC thinning, putamen atrophy/deformation (thinning and increased distance), and accelerated expansions in lateral ventricles. Common for all groups, baseline VE predicted accelerated CC thinning and putamen atrophy/deformation and conversely, baseline CC and putamen atrophy/deformation and enlarged third and fourth ventricles predicted accelerated lateral ventricular expansion. The results suggest a progressive VE within the 4 ventricles as FXTAS develops and a deleterious cycle between VE and brain deformation that may commonly occur during aging and FXTAS progression but become accelerated in FXTAS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Given the increased risk of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and inflammation among APOE-ε4 carriers, we aimed to examine whether BBB dysfunction and inflammation contribute to the relationship between APOE and AD key pathologies, as measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We applied bootstrapped regression and path analyses involving Q-albumin CSF/plasma ratio (a BBB/blood-CSF barrier function marker), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12p70; inflammation markers), and CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> and amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub> (AD pathology markers) of 97 participants (aged 38-83 years) from a university memory clinic. Our results showed that relationship between BBB dysfunction and AD pathology is modulated by IL-6 and these associations appear to be driven by the APOE-ε4 genotype. This suggests that APOE-ε4-related vascular factors are also part of the pathway to AD pathology, in synergy with an elevated immune response, and could become targets for trials focused on delaying AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Older individuals are also sustaining higher levels of alcohol consumption later in life, and binge drinking remains a prevalent pastime in a significant proportion of aged individuals. Older people are more sensitive to neurobehavioral effects of alcohol, and as individuals age, the cumulative impact of lifetime alcohol intake begins to emerge. This brief review provides a perspective on the emerging field of how alcohol interacts with the aging brain and sets the stage for understanding the relationship between alcohol and overall brain health. In doing so, we introduce a set of articles collected in this book series (all chapters available on PubMed) which spans human epidemiology and clinical outcomes, along with a series of neurobehavioral studies in preclinical (rodent) models. Because both natural aging as well as alcohol use and abuse include tell-tale signs of neuroinflammation (heightened expression of neuroimmune genes, activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, and signs of glial activation), particular emphasis is placed on the role of neuroinflammation in both aging- and alcohol-related alterations in neurobehavioral function, with special emphasis on the spectrum of cognitive dysfunction ranging from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's associated brain pathology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The increase in the number of older individuals will place a strain on many national health care systems making it important to investigate behaviors in the aged that may negatively impact general health in this demographic. Recent work has shown that older adults consume alcohol, often at levels that exceed the legal limit of intoxication. Unfortunately, consumption of high levels of ethanol in the older population is associated with many health consequences and may negatively impact the brain. Given ethical constraints found in many biomedical studies, animal models are needed to investigate the possible negative impact of high ethanol use in aged populations. However, few studies have investigated the effect of ethanol exposure in aged animals compared to ethanol exposure in younger animals and consequently the impact of ethanol in the aged population is not well understood. The current review summarizes initial work establishing the impact of ethanol in aged animals. The reviewed research studies support the working hypothesis that ethanol exposure produces significantly greater effects in aged animals compared to younger animals on many, if not all, behavioral tasks. In addition, the review proposes several initial, promising avenues of research to explore the neurobiological mechanisms that underly greater effects on ethanol-induced ataxia, cognition and sleep time. It is hoped that this effort will not only lead to a better understanding of behaviors impacted by ethanol in aged animals, but also improve the understanding brain mechanisms of the reported increased sensitivity to ethanol in the aged population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Substantial literatures have attempted to characterize health benefits/risks of moderate drinking lifestyles. Not uncommonly, reports address outcomes in a single outcome, such as cardiovascular function or cognitive decline, rather than providing a broader overview of systems. In this narrative review, retaining focus on neurobiological considerations, we summarize key findings regarding moderate drinking and three health domains, cardiovascular health, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cognition. Interestingly, few investigators have studied bouts of low/moderate doses of alcohol consumption, a pattern consistent with moderate drinking lifestyles. Here, we address both moderate drinking as a lifestyle and as an acute event. Review of health-related correlates illustrates continuing inconsistencies. Although substantive reductions in risk for cardiovascular and T2D events are reported, robust conclusions remain elusive. Similarly, whereas moderate drinking is often associated with enhanced cognition and lower dementia risk, few benefits are noted in rates of decline or alterations in brain structure. The effect of sex/gender varies across health domains and by consumption levels. For example, women appear to differentially benefit from alcohol use in terms of T2D, but experience greater risk when considering aspects of cardiovascular function. Finally, we observe that socially relevant alcohol doses do not consistently impair performance in older adults. Rather, older drinkers demonstrate divergent, but not necessarily detrimental, patterns in neural activation and some behavioral measures relative to younger drinkers. Taken together, the epidemiological and laboratory studies reinforce the need for greater attention to key individual differences and for the conduct of systematic studies sensitive to age-related shifts in neurobiological systems.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although binge-drinking is assumed to be a college-age problem, older adults (ages 65+) consume binge amounts of alcohol and have alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Moreover, individuals with alcohol dependence in their youth often continue to drink as they age. As such, this study tested the hypothesis that the effects of alcohol on hippocampal microglia are exacerbated in aged versus younger rodents in two AUD models. Briefly, adult (2-3 months) and aged (15+ months) Sprague-Dawley rats were administered alcohol or control diet using the Majchrowicz model to study alcohol-induced neurodegeneration. To study the effects of non-dependent binge consumption on microglia, adolescent (6-8 weeks) and aged (18+ months) C57/BL6N were subjected to the Drinking in the Dark paradigm. Microglia number and densitometry were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Hippocampal subregional and model/species-specific effects of alcohol were observed, but overall, aging did not appear to increase the alcohol-induced microglia reactivity as measured by Iba-1 densitometry. However, analysis of microglial counts revealed a significant decrease in the number microglia cells in both the alcohol-induced neurodegeneration and DID model across age groups. In the dentate gyrus, the loss of microglia was exacerbated by aging, particularly in mice after DID, non-dependent model. Using qRT-PCR, the persistence of alcohol and aging effects was assessed following the DID model. Allograft Inflammatory Factor 1 mRNA was increased in both young and aged mice by alcohol exposure; however, only in the aged mice did the alcohol effect persist. Overall, these data imply that the microglial response to alcohol is complex with evidence of depressed numbers of microglia but also increased reactivity with advanced age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Two fundamental features of the human experience that change dramatically across the lifespan include social interactions and, for many, patterns of alcohol consumption. Rodent models show great utility for understanding complex interactions among aging, social behavior and alcohol use and abuse, yet little is known about the neural changes in late aging that contribute to the natural decline in social behavior. Here, we posit that aging-related neuroinflammation contributes to the insipid loss of social motivation across the lifespan, an effect that is exacerbated by patterns of repeated alcohol consumption observed in many individuals. We provide a comprehensive review of (i) neural substrates crucial for the expression of social behavior under non-pathological conditions; (ii) unique developmental/lifespan vulnerabilities that may contribute to the divergent effects of low-and high-dose alcohol exposure; and (iii) aging-associated changes in neuroinflammation that may sit at the intersection between social processes and alcohol exposure. In doing so, we provide an overview of correspondence between lifespan/developmental periods between common rodent models and humans, give careful consideration to model systems used to aptly probe social behavior, identify points of coherence between human and animal models, and point toward a multitude of unresolved issues that should be addressed in future studies. Together, the combination of low-dose and high-dose alcohol effects serve to disrupt the normal development and maintenance of social relationships, which are critical for both healthy aging and quality of life across the lifespan. Thus, a more complete understanding of neural systems-including neuroinflammatory processes-which contribute to alcohol-induced changes in social behavior will provide novel opportunities and targets for promoting healthy aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although the link between alcohol use and AD has been studied, preclinical research has potential to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this interaction. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that nondependent alcohol drinking exacerbates the onset and magnitude of AD-like neural and behavioral pathology. We first evaluated the impact of voluntary 24-h, two-bottle choice home-cage alcohol drinking on the prefrontal cortex and amygdala neuroproteome in C57BL/6J mice and found a striking association between alcohol drinking and AD-like pathology. Bioinformatics identified the AD-associated proteins MAPT (Tau), amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), and presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) as the main modulators of alcohol-sensitive protein networks that included AD-related proteins that regulate energy metabolism (ATP5D, HK1, AK1, PGAM1, CKB), cytoskeletal development (BASP1, CAP1, DPYSL2 [CRMP2], ALDOA, TUBA1A, CFL2, ACTG1), cellular/oxidative stress (HSPA5, HSPA8, ENO1, ENO2), and DNA regulation (PURA, YWHAZ). To address the impact of alcohol drinking on AD, studies were conducted using 3xTg-AD mice that express human MAPT, APP, and PSEN-1 transgenes and develop AD-like brain and behavioral pathology. 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice consumed alcohol or saccharin for 4 months. Behavioral tests were administered during a 1-month alcohol-free period. Alcohol intake induced AD-like behavioral pathologies in 3xTg-AD mice including impaired spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze, diminished sensorimotor gating as measured by prepulse inhibition, and exacerbated conditioned fear. Multiplex immunoassay conducted on brain lysates showed that alcohol drinking upregulated primary markers of AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice: Aβ 42/40 ratio in the lateral entorhinal and prefrontal cortex and total Tau expression in the lateral entorhinal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala at 1-month post alcohol exposure. Immunocytochemistry showed that alcohol use upregulated expression of pTau (Ser199/Ser202) in the hippocampus, which is consistent with late-stage AD. According to the NIA-AA Research Framework, these results suggest that alcohol use is associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Results also showed that alcohol use was associated with a general reduction in Akt/mTOR signaling via several phosphoproteins (IR, IRS1, IGF1R, PTEN, ERK, mTOR, p70S6K, RPS6) in multiple brain regions including hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Dysregulation of Akt/mTOR phosphoproteins suggests alcohol may target this pathway in AD progression. These results suggest that nondependent alcohol drinking increases the onset and magnitude of AD-like neural and behavioral pathology in 3xTg-AD mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The relative contributions of different etiological factors, such as alcohol, thiamine deficiency and age vulnerability, to the development of alcohol-related neuropathology and cognitive impairment are still poorly understood. One reason for this quandary is that both alcohol toxicity and thiamine deficiency produce brain damage and cognitive problems that can be modulated by age at exposure, aging following alcohol toxicity or thiamine deficiency, and aging during chronic alcohol exposure. Pre-clinical models of alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) have elucidated some of the contributions of ethanol toxicity and thiamine deficiency to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss and functional deficits. However, the critical variable of age at the time of exposure or long-term aging with ARBD has been relatively ignored. Acute thiamine deficiency created a massive increase in neuroimmune genes and proteins within the thalamus and significant increases within the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Chronic ethanol treatment throughout adulthood produced very minor fluctuations in neuroimmune genes, regardless of brain region. Intermittent 'binge-type' ethanol during the adolescent period established an intermediate neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, that can persist into adulthood. Chronic excessive drinking throughout adulthood, adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure, and thiamine deficiency all led to a loss of the cholinergic neuronal phenotype within the basal forebrain, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, and alterations in the frontal cortex. Only thiamine deficiency results in gross pathological lesions of the thalamus. The behavioral impairment following these types of treatments is hierarchical: Thiamine deficiency produces the greatest impairment of hippocampal- and prefrontal-dependent behaviors, chronic ethanol drinking ensues mild impairments on both types of tasks and adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure leads to impairments on frontocortical tasks, with sparing on most hippocampal-dependent tasks. However, our preliminary data suggest that as rodents age following adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure, hippocampal functional deficits began to emerge. A necessary requirement for the advancement of understanding the neural consequences of alcoholism is a more comprehensive assessment and understanding of how excessive alcohol drinking at different development periods (adolescence, early adulthood, middle-aged and aged) influences the trajectory of the aging process, including pathological aging and disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Excessive alcohol consumption causes morbidity and mortality, especially among older adults, including an increased risk of depressive episodes. We review the mechanisms through which alcohol consumption may affect depression, and argue that the effects of alcohol consumption on depressive episodes among older adults are understudied. We harmonized data among older adults (≥50 years) on alcohol consumption, depressive episodes, and an array of risk factors across 10 years and 19 countries (N=57,276). Alcohol consumption was categorized as current or long-term abstainer, occasional, moderate and heavy drinking at an average of 2.3 follow-up time points. Depressive episodes were measured through the CES-D or EURO-D. Multi-level Cox proportional frailty models in which the random effect has a multiplicative relationship to hazard were estimated with controls for co-occurring medical conditions, health behaviors, and demographics. Long-term alcohol abstainers had a higher hazard of depressive episodes (HR=1.14, 95% C.I. 1.08-1.21), as did those reporting occasional (HR=1.16, 95% C.I. 1.10-1.21) and heavy drinking (HR=1.22, 95% C.I. 1.13-1.30), compared with moderate drinking. Hazard ratios were attenuated in frailty models; heavy drinking, however, remained robustly associated in a random-effects model with a frailty component (HR=1.16, 95% C.I. 1.11-1.21). Interactions were observed by gender and smoking status: long-term abstainers, women's, and smokers' (HR for interaction, 1.04, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.07) hazards of depressive episodes increased more than what would be expected based on their multiplicative effects, when compared to moderate drinking, non-smoking men. Excessive alcohol consumption among older adults is a concern not only for physical, but also for mental health. Physician efforts to screen older adults for excessive alcohol use is critical for mental health to remain strong in aging populations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While the clinical presentation of LRRK2 mutation carriers is similar to that of idiopathic PD (iPD) patients, the neuropathology of LRRK2 PD is less clearly defined. Lewy bodies (LBs) composed of α-synuclein are a major feature of iPD, but are not present in all LRRK2 PD cases. There is some evidence that tau may act as a neuropathological substrate in LB-negative LRRK2 PD, but this has not been examined systematically. In the current study, we examined α-synuclein, tau, and amyloid β (Aβ) pathologies in 12 LRRK2 mutation carriers. We find that α-synuclein pathology is present in 63.6% of LRRK2 mutation carriers, but tau pathology can be found in 100% of carriers and is abundant in 91% of carriers. We further use an antibody which selectively binds Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type tau and use quantitative analysis of tau pathology to demonstrate that AD tau is the prominent type of tau present in LRRK2 mutation carriers. Abundant Aβ pathology can also be found in LRRK2 mutation carriers and is consistent with comorbid AD pathology. Finally, we assessed the association of neuropathology with clinical features in LRRK2 mutation carriers and idiopathic individuals and find that LRRK2 PD shares clinical and pathological features of idiopathic PD. The prevalence of AD-type tau pathology in LRRK2 PD is an important consideration for understanding PD pathogenesis and refining clinical trial inclusion and progression criterion.</AbstractText>"}

Dynamic balance was expressed as the range, velocity, standard deviation (SD), maximum Lyapunov Exponent and sample entropy of centre of pressure displacement in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction, as well as free moment during the STS test. Except for higher age, no marked differences were seen between working and retired participants. Both age and musculoskeletal pain were negatively associated with motor function. Age × pain interactions showed that completion time, stand time, RFD<sub>up</sub> and RFD<sub>down</sub> were negatively associated with age for participants without pain, but positively for those with pain. Similar findings were seen for dynamic balance. These findings indicate that the effects of lower extremity musculoskeletal pain on lower extremity function and dynamic balance are age dependent.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent discovery of NGLY1-deficiency, which causes severe systemic symptoms, drew attention to the physiological function of Ngly1 in mammals. While several studies have been carried out to reveal the physiological necessity of Ngly1, the semi-lethal nature of Ngly1-deficient animals made it difficult to analyze its function in adults. In this study, we focus on the physiological function of Ngly1 in liver (hepatocyte)-specific Ngly1-deficient mice generated using the cre-loxP system. We found that hepatocyte-specific Ngly1-deficient mice showed abnormal hepatocyte nuclear size/morphology with aging but did not show other notable defects in unstressed conditions. This nuclear phenotype did not appear to be related to the function of the only gene currently reported to rescue Ngly1-deficient murine lethality so far, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. We also found that under a high fructose diet induced stress, the hepatocyte-specific Ngly1-deletion resulted in liver transaminases elevation and increased lipid droplet accumulation. We showed that the processing and localization of the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 1 (Nfe2l1), was impaired in the Ngly1-deficient hepatocytes. Therefore, Nfe2l1, at least partially, contributes to the phenotypes observed in hepatocyte-specific Ngly1-deficient mice. Our results indicate that Ngly1 plays important roles in the adult liver impacting nuclear morphology and lipid metabolism. Hepatocyte-specific Ngly1-deficient mice could thus serve as a valuable animal model for assessing in vivo efficacy of drugs and/or treatment for NGLY1-deficiency.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Oxidative damage contributes to the hallmarks of ageing and essential components in pathological pathways which are thought to drive multiple age-related diseases. Nonetheless, results from studies testing the hypothesis of oxidative stress in ageing and diseases showed controversial results. While observational studies mainly found detrimental effects of high oxidative stress levels on disease status, randomized clinical trials examining the effect of antioxidant supplementation on disease status generally showed null effects. However, re-evaluations of these counterinitiative observations are required considering the lack of reliability and specificity of traditionally used biomarkers for measuring oxidative stress. To facilitate these re-evaluations, this review summarizes the basic knowledge of oxidative stress and the present findings regarding the role of oxidative damage in ageing and age-related diseases. Meanwhile, two approaches are highlighted, namely proper participants selection, together with the development of reliable biomarkers. We propose that oxidized vitamin E metabolites may be used to accurately monitor individual functional antioxidant level, which might serve as promising key solutions for future elucidating the impact of oxidative stress on ageing and age-related diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

The definition of cellular senescence has expanded to include the growth arrest caused by various cellular stresses, including DNA damage, inadequate mitochondria function, activated oncogene or tumor suppressor genes and oxidative stress. While senescence in normal aging involves various tissues over time and contributes to a decline in tissue function even with healthy aging, disease-induced premature senescence may be restricted to one or a few organs triggering a prolonged and more intense rate of accumulation of senescent cells than in normal aging. Organ-specific high senescence rate could lead to chronic diseases, especially in post-mitotic rich tissue. Recently, two opposite acquired pathological conditions related to skin pigmentation were described to be associated with premature senescence: vitiligo and melasma. In both cases, it was demonstrated that pathological dysfunctions are not restricted to melanocytes, the cell type responsible for melanin production and transport to surrounding keratinocytes. Similar to physiological melanogenesis, dermal and epidermal cells contribute directly and indirectly to deregulate skin pigmentation as a result of complex intercellular communication. Thus, despite senescence usually being reported as a uniform phenotype sharing the expression of characteristic markers, skin senescence involving mainly the dermal compartment and its paracrine function could be associated with the disappearance of melanocytes in vitiligo lesions and with the exacerbated activity of melanocytes in the hyperpigmentation spots of melasma. This suggests that the difference may arise in melanocyte intrinsic differences and/or in highly defined microenvironment peculiarities poorly explored at the current state of the art. A similar dualistic phenotype has been attributed to intratumoral stromal cells as cancer-associated fibroblasts presenting a senescent-like phenotype which influence the behavior of neoplastic cells in either a tumor-promoting or tumor-inhibiting manner. Here, we present a framework dissecting senescent-related molecular alterations shared by vitiligo and melasma patients and we also discuss disease-specific differences representing new challenges for treatment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we evaluated the impact of a day of intensive meditation practice (t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>1</sub> = 8 h) on the methylome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in experienced meditators (n = 17). In parallel, we assessed the influence of a day of leisure activities in the same environment on the methylome of matched control subjects with no meditation experience (n = 17). DNA methylation profiles were analyzed using the Illumina 450 K beadchip array. We fitted for each methylation site a linear model for multi-level experiments which adjusts the variation between t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> for baseline differences. No significant baseline differences in methylation profiles was detected between groups. In the meditation group, we identified 61 differentially methylated sites (DMS) after the intervention. These DMS were enriched in genes mostly associated with immune cell metabolism and ageing and in binding sites for several transcription factors involved in immune response and inflammation, among other functions. In the control group, no significant change in methylation level was observed after the day of leisure activities. These results suggest that a short meditation intervention in trained subjects may rapidly influence the epigenome at sites of potential relevance for immune function and provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the human methylome over short time windows.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The structure and pasting, aging, moisture absorption and thermal properties of the plasticized starches were studied by means of Fourier transformed infrared, X-ray diffraction, rapid viscosity analysis, tension test and thermogravimetric analysis. Comparing with single plasticizer, co-plasticizers with appropriate proportions are more effective in hindering the retrogradation of starch paste and film. The results also showed that the mechanical property and humidity sensitivity of the starch film worsen after the introduction of PEG200 compared with sodium citrate plasticized starch, but the thermal stability and anti-aging property increase. This is consistent with the association ability of plasticizers with starch observed from FTIR. In addition to the simple additive effect of components on some properties, special formulations also show some synergistic effects, such as the co-plasticizer of 20% citric acid and 5% PEG200 has a better comprehensive property for plasticizing the maize starch bulk than sodium citrate or PEG200 alone.

We focused on age differences during intention encoding, retention and retrieval in order to assess if potential age-associated performance differences in adolescence and older age can be explained by associated neurophysiological differences. Our research aim was to understand the impact of memory-related factors such as intention load and encoding time on prospective remembering, focusing especially on encoding and retention, which are two so far scarcely investigated phases. Adolescents, younger and older adults worked on a semantic judgment task with an embedded prospective memory task. Participants had to encode either one or two intentions; the encoding time was either four or eight seconds long. Younger and older adults outperformed adolescents behaviorally. Furthermore, performance was better for remembering one intention compared to remembering two intentions. On the neural level, we found age-specific modulations for the fronto-polar slow wave (FPSW) and the temporal-parietal slow wave (TPSW) that were sensitive to the number of intentions. Adolescents showed differences between encoding one or two intentions in the FPSW, while older adults showed these differences for the TPSW. Maintaining an intention increased fronto-central sustained activity compared to no intention. Furthermore, the activity during intention maintenance was sensitive to the number of intentions. Prospective positivity amplitudes during retrieval were smallest in adolescents and largest in older adults, but were not influenced by the memory manipulations. Parietal slow wave activity increased with increasing number of intentions, reflecting post-retrieval coordination between the ongoing and prospective memory task. In sum, only activity of the FPSW and the TPSW showed that age-related differences were influenced by memory-related factors during encoding, whereas these interactions were not observed for retention or retrieval. Our findings suggest that intention encoding and its efficiency play an important role in explaining age differences in prospective memory.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, increasing attention is being paid to RNA-binding proteins (RBP) in cancer pathophysiology. The precise role of RBP in breast cancer, however, remains to be clarified. We herein show that an RBP non-POU domain-containing octamer binding (NONO) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of breast cancers regardless of their hormone dependency. Clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of 127 breast cancer cases showed that NONO is a significant independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. Notably, siRNA-mediated NONO knockdown substantially repressed the proliferation of both hormone-sensitive MCF-7 and hormone-refractory MB-MDA-231 breast cancer cells. Integrative analysis combined with expression microarray and RIP-sequencing (RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing) showed that NONO post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of cell proliferation-related genes by binding to their mRNAs, as exemplified by S-phase-associated kinase 2 and E2F transcription factor 8. Overall, these results suggest that NONO is a key regulator for breast cancer proliferation through the pre-mRNA splicing of cell proliferation-related genes and could be a potential new diagnostic and therapeutic target for advanced disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

We used a nonhuman primate model to profile the transcriptome of gingival tissues in health across the lifespan and hypothesized that in older animals, epithelial-related transcriptome patterns would reflect epithelial cells that are aggressively responsive to the surrounding environment and less able to modulate and resolve the noxious challenge from the bacteria. Rhesus monkeys (n = 34) with a healthy periodontium were distributed into four groups: ≤3 years (young), 3-7 years (adolescent), 12-16 years (adult), and 18-23 years (aged), and a buccal gingival sample from the premolar/molar region of each animal was obtained. RNA was subjected to a microarray analysis (GeneChip<sup>®</sup> Rhesus Macaque Genome Array, Affymetrix), and 336 genes examined that are linked to epithelium and epithelial cell functions categorized into 9 broad functional groups: extracellular matrix and cell structure; extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes; cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeleton regulation; inflammatory response; growth factors; kinases/cell signaling; cell surface receptors; junction associated molecules; autophagy/apoptosis; antimicrobial peptides; and transcription factors. Total of 255 genes displayed a normalized signal &gt;100, and differences across the age groups were observed primarily in extracellular matrix and cell structure, cell adhesion molecules, and cell surface receptor gene categories with elevations in the aged tissues. Keratins 2, 5, 6B, 13, 16, 17 were all significantly increased in healthy-aged tissues versus adults, and keratins 1 and 2 were significantly decreased in young animals. Approximately 15 integrins are highly expressed in the gingival tissues across the age groups with only ITGA8, ITGAM (CD11b), and ITGB2 significantly increased in the aged tissues. Little impact of aging on desmosomal/hemidesmosomal genes was noted. These results suggest that healthy gingival aging has a relatively limited impact on the broader functions of the epithelium and epithelial cells, with some effects on genes for extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules (e.g., integrins). Thus, while there is a substantial impact of aging on immune system targets even in healthy gingiva, it appears that the epithelial barrier remains reasonably molecularly intact in this model system.</AbstractText>"}

Decreased mitochondrial function along with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accumulation of damaged macromolecules are hallmarks of cellular aging. Based on numerous studies indicating pleiotropic effects of IGF-1 during aging, we compared the central and peripheral effects of circulating IGF-1 deficiency on tissue mitochondrial function using an inducible liver IGF-1 knockout (LID). Circulating levels of IGF-1 (~ 75%) were depleted in adult male Igf1<sup>f/f</sup> mice via AAV-mediated knockdown of hepatic IGF-1 at 5 months of age. Cognitive function was evaluated at 18 months using the radial arm water maze and glucose and insulin tolerance assessed. Mitochondrial function was analyzed in hippocampus, muscle, and visceral fat tissues using high-resolution respirometry O2K as well as redox status and oxidative stress in the cortex. Peripherally, IGF-1 deficiency did not significantly impact muscle mass or mitochondrial function. Aged LID mice were insulin resistant and exhibited ~ 60% less adipose tissue but increased fat mitochondrial respiration (20%). The effects on fat metabolism were attributed to increases in growth hormone. Centrally, IGF-1 deficiency impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial acquisition as well as reversal learning in male mice. Hippocampal mitochondrial OXPHOS coupling efficiency and cortex ATP levels (~ 50%) were decreased and hippocampal oxidative stress (protein carbonylation and F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostanes) was increased. These data suggest that IGF-1 is critical for regulating mitochondrial function, redox status, and spatial learning in the central nervous system but has limited impact on peripheral (liver and muscle) metabolism with age. Therefore, IGF-1 deficiency with age may increase sensitivity to damage in the brain and propensity for cognitive deficits. Targeting mitochondrial function in the brain may be an avenue for therapy of age-related impairment of cognitive function. Regulation of mitochondrial function and redox status by IGF-1 is essential to maintain brain function and coordinate hippocampal-dependent spatial learning. While a decline in IGF-1 in the periphery may be beneficial to avert cancer progression, diminished central IGF-1 signaling may mediate, in part, age-related cognitive dysfunction and cognitive pathologies potentially by decreasing mitochondrial function.</AbstractText>"}

The presence of diabetes may aggravate the normal ageing process in the middle-aged Indians. These SA-miRNAs can also be used to check the cellular dysfunctions and ageing of pancreatic β-cells.</AbstractText>"}

The eradication of JAK2V617F hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is critical for achieving molecular remissions and cure. We investigate the distinct effects of two therapies, ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α), on the disease-initiating HSC population. Whereas ruxolitinib inhibits Stat5 activation in erythroid progenitor populations, it fails to inhibit this same pathway in HSCs. In contrast, IFN-α has direct effects on HSCs. Furthermore, STAT1 phosphorylation and pathway activation is greater after IFN-α stimulation in Jak2V617F murine HSCs with increased induction of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and reduction in quiescence after chronic IFN-α treatment. Interestingly, ruxolitinib does not block IFN-α induced reactive oxygen species and DNA damage in Jak2V617F murine HSCs in vivo. This work provides a mechanistic rationale informing how pegylated IFN-α reduces JAK2V617F allelic burden in the clinical setting and may inform future clinical efforts to combine ruxolitinib with pegylated IFN-α in patients with MPN.</AbstractText>"}

One potential intersection point for these three systems is the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. This study explored the impact of the prototypic glutamatergic modulator ketamine on the endogenous KYN pathway in individuals with bipolar depression (BD), as well as the relationship between response to ketamine and depression-related behavioral and peripheral inflammatory markers. Thirty-nine participants with treatment-resistant BD (23 F, ages 18-65) received a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 min. KYN pathway analytes-including plasma concentrations of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), KYN, kynurenic acid (KynA), and quinolinic acid (QA)-were assessed at baseline (pre-infusion), 230 min, day 1, and day 3 post-ketamine. General linear models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and robust sandwich variance estimators were implemented. A repeated effect of time was used to model the covariance of the residuals with an unstructured matrix. After controlling for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), post-ketamine IDO levels were significantly lower than baseline at all three time points. Conversely, ketamine treatment significantly increased KYN and KynA levels at days 1 and 3 versus baseline. No change in QA levels was observed post-ketamine. A lower post-ketamine ratio of QA/KYN was observed at day 1. In addition, baseline levels of proinflammatory cytokines and behavioral measures predicted KYN pathway changes post ketamine. The results suggest that, in addition to having rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in BD participants, ketamine also impacts key components of the KYN pathway.</AbstractText>"}

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide and disproportionately affects older adults and children. In high-income countries, pneumonia is one of the most common reasons for hospitalisation and (when recurrent) is associated with a risk of developing chronic pulmonary conditions in adulthood. Pneumococcal pneumonia is particularly prevalent in older adults, and here, pneumonia is still associated with significant mortality despite the widespread use of pneumococcal vaccination in middleand high-income countries and a low prevalence of resistant organisms. In older adults, 11% of pneumonia survivors are readmitted within months of discharge, often with a further pneumonia episode and with worse outcomes. In children, recurrent pneumonia occurs in approximately 10% of survivors and therefore is a significant cause of healthcare use. Current antibiotic trials focus on short-term outcomes and increasingly shorter courses of antibiotic therapy. However, the high requirement for further treatment for recurrent pneumonia questions the effectiveness of current strategies, and there is increasing global concern about our reliance on antibiotics to treat infections. Novel therapeutic targets and approaches are needed to improve outcomes. Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cell and among the first responders to infection. Appropriate neutrophil responses are crucial to host defence, as evidenced by the poor outcomes seen in neutropenia. Neutrophils from older adults appear to be dysfunctional, displaying a reduced ability to target infected or inflamed tissue, poor phagocytic responses and a reduced capacity to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); this occurs in health, but responses are further diminished during infection and particularly during sepsis, where a reduced response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) inhibits the release of immature neutrophils from the bone marrow. Of note, neutrophil responses are similar in preterm infants. Here, the storage pool is decreased, neutrophils are less able to degranulate, have a reduced migratory capacity and are less able to release NETs. Less is known about neutrophil function from older children, but theoretically, impaired functions might increase susceptibility to infections. Targeting these blunted responses may offer a new paradigm for treating CAP, but modifying neutrophil behaviour is challenging; reducing their numbers or inhibiting their function is associated with poor clinical outcomes from infection. Uncontrolled activation and degranulation can cause significant host tissue damage. Any neutrophil-based intervention must walk the tightrope described by Heinrich Rohrer, facilitating necessary phagocytic functions while preventing bystander host damage, and this is a significant challenge which this review will explore.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Studies across surgical subspecialties and in emergency and elective settings have identified frailty as an independent predictor of adverse postoperative clinician-reported, patient-reported and process-related outcomes. Although frailty is not specific to the older population, it is associated with ageing and therefore is increasingly observed in the ageing surgical population. Identifying frailty early in the perioperative pathway affords the opportunity to assess risk, modify the syndrome, inform shared decision making and plan the surgical pathway. Multiple tools to screen and diagnose frailty exist with limited appraisal of clinometric properties.

KD feeding resulted in an expansion of γδ T cells in the lung that improved barrier functions, thereby enhancing antiviral resistance. Expansion of these protective γδ T cells required metabolic adaptation to a ketogenic diet because neither feeding mice a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet nor providing chemical ketone body substrate that bypasses hepatic ketogenesis protected against infection.

The most novel aspect of this update is represented by the introduction of DOACs as pharmacological options both for prophylaxis and treatment of VTE in patients with cancer. The heterogeneity of the cancer population in terms of type and stage of the malignancy, presence of comorbidities, and variability in cancer treatments and prognosis represent the major challenge of managing VTE in patients with cancer. The use of VTE prophylaxis is currently recommended in cancer patients admitted to the hospital for an acute illness or reduced mobility, but no sufficient information is available on the risk of bleeding during thromboprophylaxis. Concerning the thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, further refinement of existing risk models or development of new models are needed for improving risk stratification to identify high-risk cancer patients. The updated ASCO guidelines recommend the use of DOACs (edoxaban and rivaroxaban) for treatment of VTE in patients with cancer. However, Major concerns on 'real-life' use of DOACs in patients with cancer are highlighted especially for the bleeding risk in patients with gastrointestinal cancers and the potential drug-drug interactions with specific anticancer therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainties to the updated ASCO guidelines remain concerning a number of indications on prophylaxis and treatment due to the limited evidence available. These limitations determine the low strength of the recommendations. The ongoing studies will contribute to refine the best management of patients with cancer-associated VTE.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

At any given age, they have developed about 3.5 percent more health deficits. These differences due to seasons of birth are not mediated by body height and education. In a subsample of Southern European countries, where the seasonal variation of sunlight is smaller, the birth season plays an insignificant role for health in old age.

Therefore, therapeutic strategies to treat age-related cognitive decline are needed to enhance the quality of life among the elderly. Activation of the Nr4a family of transcription factors has been closely linked to memory formation and dysregulation of these transcription factors is thought to be associated with age-related cognitive decline. Previously, we have shown that Nr4a transcription can be activated by synthetic bisindole-derived compounds (C-DIM). C-DIM compounds enhance synaptic plasticity and long-term contextual fear memory in young healthy mice. In this study, we show that activation of Nr4a2 by 1,1-bis(3'-Indolyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl) methane (C-DIM12), enhances long-term spatial memory in young mice and rescues memory deficits in aged mice. These findings suggest that C-DIM activators of Nr4a transcription may be suitable to prevent memory deficits associated with aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Adults with ASDs scored significantly lower on assessments of motor skills compared with an age-matched group of typical control adults. In addition, functional connectivity of the sensorimotor system was reduced and the pattern of connectivity was more heterogeneous in adults with ASDs. A negative correlation between functional connectivity of the motor system and motor skills, however, was only found in the typical control group.

Syrah","Abstract":"<AbstractText>One of the main consequences of the advancement of harvest date associated to global climate change is that the phenolic maturity of grapes can be delayed in relation to their technological maturity. As a consequence, wines made from these grapes can be poor in phenolic compounds or possess an unbalanced phenolic composition, affecting their global quality. The combined post-fermentative addition of seeds and an astringency-modulator mannoprotein (MP) might be a potential strategy to solve this problem, since seeds might supply flavanols and improve wine chemical stability and the mannoprotein might modulate the changes induced in astringency by the addition of seeds and improve wine colloidal stability. The present study aimed at monitoring at different moments of winemaking and ageing the effects and side-effects of this combined strategy on the detailed flavanol, flavonol and anthocyanin compositions and on colour of wines made from Syrah grapes. Seeds were obtained from Pedro Ximénez overripe grapes. Flavanol composition and flavonol and anthocyanin compositions were determined by HPLC-MS<sup>n</sup>-MRM and HPLC-DAD-MS<sup>n</sup> analyses, respectively. Colour changes caused by these additions were studied from CIELAB parameters as well as the ability of these techniques to protect colour from bleaching agents, such as SO<sub>2</sub>. In general, the addition of seeds initially increased the levels of flavanols and anthocyanins. However, during bottle ageing a reduction in the levels of flavanols, flavonols and anthocyanins could be observed in seed treated wines, which might be related to the greater formation of flavanol aggregates associated with greater levels of flavanols. This effect was partially solved for most of the flavonoids studied with the additional MP treatment. Treated and control wines showed colour differences that were visible to human eye, although they were reduced over time. At the end of the study, treated wines showed colour parameters corresponding to younger wines than those observed in control wines. A greater resistance against SO<sub>2</sub> bleaching was also observed in treated wines, which can be mainly associated to the greater percentages of polymeric pigments caused by seed treatment and to the improvement of the colloidal stability of SO<sub>2</sub>-resistant pigments caused by the addition of the MP.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

PGG suppressed UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression in HaCaT cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of RAF/MEK/ERK, MKK3/6/p38, and c-Jun. UVB-induced ERK and p38 signaling pathways that induce the MMP-1 expression were mediated by PAK1 in HaCaT cells. PGG suppressed PAK1 and JNK1 kinase activities, and directly bound both PAK1 in an ATP-competitive manner and JNK1 in an ATP-noncompetitive manner. Consistently, PGG decreased UVB-induced wrinkle formation, epidermal thickness, type 1 collagen and MMP-13 expression in mouse skin.

With the discovery of beneficial aspects of cellular senescence and evidence of senescence being not limited to replicative cellular states, a redefinition of our comprehension of aging and senescence appears scientifically overdue. Here, we provide a factor-based comparison of current knowledge on aging and senescence, which we converge on four suggested concepts, thereby implementing the newly emerging cellular and molecular aspects of geroconversion and amitosenescence, and the signatures of a genetic state termed genosenium.

The bicomponent fibers exhibited a uniform diameter distribution and compact texture at the ultimate draw ratio. Although the presence of PLLA reduced the crystallinity of the POM domain in the bicomponent fibers, the post-drawing process promoted the crystalline orientation of lamellar folded-chain crystallites due to the stress-induced crystallization effect and enhanced the crystallinity of the POM domain accordingly. As a result, the bicomponent fibers achieved the relatively high tensile strength of 791 MPa. The bicomponent fibers exhibited a partial hydration capability in both acid and alkali media and therefore could meet the requirement for serving as a type of biodegradable fibers.

Such a combination of two polymers shortened the thermal lifetime of the bicomponent fibers, which could facilitate their natural degradation for ecological and sustainable applications.</AbstractText>"}

Silicon is an essential trace element highly present in arteries. It is involved in the constitution and stabilization of elastin fibers. The nutritional supply and bioavailability of silicon are often inadequate. Spirulina (Sp), micro algae have recognized nutritional properties and are able to incorporate minerals in a bioavailable form. We evaluated the effects of nutritional supplementation with silicon-enriched spirulina (SpSi) on arterial system structure and function in hypertension. Experiments were performed on hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats supplemented with SpSi or Sp over a period of three months. Arterial pressure, vascular function and morphometric parameters of thoracic aorta were analyzed. SpSi supplementation lowered arterial pressure in SHR and minimized morphometric alterations induced by hypertension. Aortic wall thickness and elastic fibers fragmentation were partially reversed. Collagen and elastin levels were increased in association with extracellular matrix degradation decrease. Vascular reactivity was improved with better contractile and vasorelaxant responses to various agonists. No changes were observed in SHR supplemented with Sp. The beneficial effects of SpSi supplementation evidenced here, may be attributable to Si enrichment and offer interesting opportunities to prevent cardiovascular risks.</AbstractText>"}

This technology makes it possible to monitor all aspects of the smart building and to improve its operation. One of the main challenges encountered by IoT networks is that the the data they collect may be unreliable since IoT devices can lose accuracy for several reasons (sensor wear, sensor aging, poorly constructed buildings, etc.). The aim of our work is to study the evolution of IoT networks over time in smart buildings. The hypothesis we have tested is that, by amplifying the Lotka-Volterra equations as a community of living organisms (an ecosystem model), the reliability of the system and its components can be predicted. This model comprises a set of differential equations that describe the relationship between an IoT network and multiple IoT devices. Based on the Lotka-Volterra model, in this article, we propose a model in which the predators are the non-precision IoT devices and the prey are the precision IoT devices. Furthermore, a third species is introduced, the maintenance staff, which will impact the interaction between both species, helping the prey to survive within the ecosystem. This is the first Lotka-Volterra model that is applied in the field of IoT. Our work establishes a proof of concept in the field and opens a wide spectrum of applications for biology models to be applied in IoT.</AbstractText>"}

Morphological and chromatic features of FNAC were quantified and analyzed. The result showed that six quantified cytological features were found significantly different between patients with a histologic diagnosis of PTC and patients with histologic diagnosis of benign goiters in multivariate analysis. These cytological features were used to estimate the malignancy risk in nodules with indeterminate FNAC results. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of the diagnostic accuracy with a benign or malignant nature was 81.3% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), 78.7% (<i>p</i> = 0.014), and 56.8% (<i>p</i> = 0.52) for nodules with FNAC results of atypia, which is suspicious for malignancy and follicular neoplasm, respectively.

It has been reported that <i>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)</i> and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)</i>, of both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, produce EVs carrying extracellular DNA (eDNA). Here, we used polychromatic flow cytometry (PFC) to identify, enumerate, and characterize EVs as well as the eDNA-delivering EV compartment in the biofilm and planktonic phenotypes of <i>H.pylori</i> ATCC 43629 and <i>L. reuteri</i> DSM 17938. Biofilm formation was demonstrated and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, using a classical live/dead staining protocol. The enumeration of EVs and the detection of eDNA-associated EVs were performed by PFC, analyzing both whole samples (cells <i>plus</i> vesicles) and EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation confirm EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation. PFC analysis was performed relying on a known-size beaded system and a mix of three different fluorescent tracers. In detail, the whole EV compartment was stained by a lipophilic cationic dye (LCD), which was combined to PKH26 and PicoGreen that selectively stain lipids and DNA, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy results displayed that both <i>H. pylori</i> and <i>L. reuteri</i> produced well-structured biofilms. PFC data highlighted that, in both detected bacterial species, biofilms produced higher EVs counts when paralleled to the related planktonic phenotypes. Furthermore, the staining with PicoGreen showed that most of the generated vesicles were associated with eDNA. These data suggest that the use of PFC, set according to the parameters here described, allows for the study of the production of eDNA-associated EVs in different microbial species in the same or several phases of growth, thus opening new perspectives in the study of microbial derived EVs in clinical samples.</AbstractText>"}

Many individuals become especially susceptible to chronic-inflammation-induced sensorineural hearing loss as they age, but the intrinsic molecular mechanism behind aging individuals' increased risk of hearing loss remains unclear. FoxG1 (forkhead box transcription factor G1) is a key transcription factor that plays important roles in hair cell survival through the regulation of mitochondrial function, but how the function of FoxG1 changes during aging and under inflammatory conditions is unknown. In this study, we first found that FoxG1 expression and autophagy both increased gradually in the low concentration lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model, while after high concentration of LPS treatment both FoxG1 expression and autophagy levels decreased as the concentration of LPS increased. We then used siRNA to downregulate Foxg1 expression in hair cell-like OC-1 cells and found that cell death and apoptosis were significantly increased after LPS injury. Furthermore, we used d-galactose (D-gal) to create an aging model with hair cell-like OC-1 cells and cochlear explant cultures in vitro and found that the expression of Foxg1 and the level of autophagy were both decreased after D-gal and LPS co-treatment. Lastly, we knocked down the expression of Foxg1 under aged inflammation conditions and found increased numbers of dead and apoptotic cells. Together these results suggest that FoxG1 affects the sensitivity of mimetic aging hair cells to inflammation by regulating autophagy pathways.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

In this work, we introduce a new approach for rapid and accurate high-resolution (HR) or ultra HR (UHR) mapping of T<sub>1</sub> and apparent PD (APD) of the brain with correction of radiofrequency field, B<sub>1</sub>, inhomogeneities. The four-angle method (FAM) uses four spoiled-gradient recalled-echo (SPGR) images acquired at different flip angles (FA) and short repetition times (TRs). The first two SPGR images are acquired at low-spatial resolution and used to accurately map the active B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> field with the recently introduced steady-state double angle method (SS-DAM). The estimated B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> map is used in conjunction with the two other SPGR images, acquired at HR or UHR, to map T<sub>1</sub> and APD. The method is evaluated with numerical, phantom, and in-vivo imaging measurements. Furthermore, we investigated imaging acceleration methods to further shorten the acquisition time. Our results indicate that FAM provides an accurate method for simultaneous HR or UHR mapping of T<sub>1</sub> and APD in human brain in clinical high-field MRI. Derived parameter maps without B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>correction suffer from large inaccuracies, but this issue is well-corrected through use of the SS-DAM. Furthermore, the use of SPGR imaging with short TR and phased-array coil acquisition permits substantial imaging acceleration and enables robust HR or UHR T<sub>1</sub> and APD mapping in a clinically acceptable time frame, with whole brain coverage obtained in less than 2 min or 5 min, respectively. The method exhibits high reproducibility and benefits from the use of the conventional SPGR sequence, available in all preclinical and clinical MRI machines, and very simple modeling to address a critical outstanding issue in neuroimaging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Genes involved in glycolysis (PFKP), pentose phosphate pathway (G6PD), and defense against lipid peroxidation (GPX4) scored high as synthetic sick/lethal. A surprisingly large fraction of suppressors are pathway intrinsic and encode mitochondrial proteins. A striking example of such 'intra-organelle' buffering is the alleviation of a chemical defect in complex V by simultaneous inhibition of complex I, which benefits cells by rebalancing redox cofactors, increasing reductive carboxylation, and promoting glycolysis.

Oxa acids were purified and classified into four groups based on the average length of the ethylene oxide chain. The emulsion that were prepared using the four oxa acid groups were administered to rats and the plasma concentration profiles of CoQ10 were analyzed. The absorption of CoQ10 was improved in all emulsion groups compared with that in the powder group. The emulsion using oxa acid (n = 9.0) greatly increased the plasma concentration of CoQ10. Absorption was also improved by using emulsions containing larger percentage of oxa acids (6%, 15% and 23%) to compared with the same oxa acid (n = 9.0). The effects of oxa acids on cell viability were almost the same as those of conventional surfactants such as polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80).

Because of the molecular diversity of BrC compounds and their dynamic transformations, it is challenging to predictively understand BrC optical properties. OH radical and O<sub>3</sub> reactions, together with photolysis, lead to diminished light absorption and lower warming effects of biomass burning BrC. The effects of night-time aging on the optical properties of BrC aerosols are less known. To address this knowledge gap, night-time NO<sub>3</sub> radical chemistry with tar aerosols from wood pyrolysis was investigated in a flow reactor. This study shows that the optical properties of BrC change because of transformations driven by reactions with the NO<sub>3</sub> radical that form new absorbing species and lead to significant absorption enhancement over the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) range. The overnight aging increases the mass absorption coefficients of the BrC by a factor of 1.3-3.2 between 380 nm and 650 nm. Nitrated organic compounds, particularly nitroaromatics, were identified as the main products that contribute to the enhanced light absorption in the secondary BrC. Night-time aging of BrC aerosols represents an important source of secondary BrC and can have a pronounced effect on atmospheric chemistry and air pollution.</AbstractText>"}

Methods Five databases were searched along with manual searches of retrieved articles by a single reviewer. Studies were included if they compared a freestyle lifting activity between participants with and without LBP. Data were extracted by two reviewers, and studies were appraised using the CASP tool for case-control studies. Results Nine studies were eligible. Heterogeneity did not allow for meta-analysis. Most studies (n = 8 studies) reported that people with LBP lift differently to pain-free controls. Specifically, people with LBP lift more slowly (n = 6 studies), use their legs more than their back especially when initiating lifting (n = 3 studies), and jerk less during lifting (n = 1 studies). Furthermore, the four larger studies involving people with more severe LBP also showed that people with LBP lift with less spinal range of motion and greater trunk muscle activity for a longer period. Conclusions People with LBP move slower, stiffer, and with a deeper knee bend than pain-free people during freestyle lifting tasks. Interestingly, such a lifting style mirrors how people, with and without LBP, are often told how to lift during manual handling training. The cross-sectional nature of the comparisons does not allow for causation to be determined. Implications The changes described may show embodiment of cautious movement, and the drive to protect the back. There may be value in exploring whether adopting a lifting style closer to that of pain-free people could help reduce LBP.</AbstractText>"}

Results A significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in antioxidant levels of FRAP, PMRS, and GSH and a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in oxidized products such as ROS and MDA were seen in the treated rats in comparison to the controls. The decrease in ROS and rise in FRAP and PMRS levels suggest the ability of grape juice to combat oxidative stress effectively. Conclusion We propose the role of grape juice as a potent antioxidant because of its easy bioavailability and its role in combating stress. Our results also approve grape juice as a possible antiaging agent.</AbstractText>"}

Based on World Health Organization statistics, almost 300 000 people worldwide die of burns each year. In severe burns, the cells and blood vessels are often injured and the blood supply to the wound is disturbed. Many factors such as oxygenation, infection, aging, hormones, and nutrition potentially can influence burn progression and disrupt repair with unbalanced release of various growth factors and cytokines. Different treatment approaches such as dressings and skin substitutes have been applied to aid wound healing. A thorough understanding of the effective factors on burns can improve wound healing outcomes.

Lymphedema is a debilitating condition associated initially with inflammation that then degenerates into hardening of affected tissues and the formation of ulcers on the skin of affected limbs. No definitive treatment is available. The only therapy for lymphedema consists of physiotherapy, surgery, and compression to reduce impairment, which only treats the symptoms, not the causes. A possible new therapy that could reinforce the treatment of lymphedema progression and complications is electrical stimulation (ES).

Reduced activity of ADAMTS13 (an enzyme that cleaves the pro-thrombotic and proinflammatory von Willebrand factor) and presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in liver and lung allograft failures. The effect of ADAMTS13 treatment and the impact of NETs on skin allografts, however, remain unexplored. Here, we adopted a murine model of complete mismatch full-thickness skin transplant by grafting dorsal skin from BALB/c mice to C57BL/6J background mice. Recombinant human ADAMTS13 (rhADAMTS13) treatment of graft recipients increased allograft survival. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of NETs in allografts of vehicle, but surprisingly, not in rhADAMTS13-treated mice, 3 days after surgery. Recapitulating the observations in mice, NETs were also observed in all the examined allografts from burn patients. Intriguingly, knocking out peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4, a key enzyme for NET formation) or DNase 1 treatment (which cleaves NETs) also prolonged allograft survival. In summary, rhADAMTS13 lessens inflammation in allografts by reducing NET burden, resulting in enhanced allograft survival. RhADAMTS13 and anti-NET treatments could be new therapeutic strategies to promote skin allograft longevity and, hence, the survival of patients with severe burns.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The ability to define these deficits in populations of different ages may help determine a chronological age threshold at which deficits occur and subsequently identify innovative dietary strategies for active and healthy ageing. Here, active gut microbiota and associated metabolic functions were evaluated using shotgun proteomics in three well-defined age groups consisting of 30 healthy volunteers, namely, ten infants, ten adults and ten elderly individuals. Samples from each volunteer at intervals of up to 6 months (n = 83 samples) were used for validation. Ageing gradually increases the diversity of gut bacteria that actively synthesize proteins, that is by 1.4-fold from infants to elderly individuals. An analysis of functional deficits consistently identifies a relationship between tryptophan and indole metabolism and ageing (p &lt; 2.8e<sup>-8</sup> ). Indeed, the synthesis of proteins involved in tryptophan and indole production and the faecal concentrations of these metabolites are directly correlated (r<sup>2</sup>  &gt; .987) and progressively decrease with age (r<sup>2</sup>  &gt; .948). An age threshold for a 50% decrease is observed ca. 11-31 years old, and a greater than 90% reduction is observed from the ages of 34-54 years. Based on recent investigations linking tryptophan with abundance of indole and other 'healthy' longevity molecules and on the results from this small cohort study, dietary interventions aimed at manipulating tryptophan deficits since a relatively 'young' age of 34 and, particularly, in the elderly are recommended.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Importantly, nephrogenesis normally reaches completion at about 34-36 weeks gestation, with no new nephrons formed for the lifetime in humans after this time. Although the loss of glomeruli varies among individuals due to aging, blood pressure, or additional inducers of kidney injury, much of the variation in nephron number is nowadays thought to be present at birth. According to the hyperfiltration hypothesis, this subsequent nephron loss results in compensatory hyperfiltration and/or hypertension of remaining glomeruli, thereby contributing to increased susceptibility to systemic hypertension. However, recent studies have suggested that the association between a low nephron number and systemic hypertension is not a universal finding. In most studies to date, nephron counts were performed on kidneys obtained at autopsy. Several recent studies have attempted to estimate nephron number in living human subjects, but further work is required to obtain accurate and precise estimates of nephron number using these noninvasive methods. Longitudinal studies in living humans have the potential to reveal associations between nephron number and hypertension/renal pathology.

One method to prevent osteoporosis is to increase the formation of new bone while preventing the resorption of older bone. Thus, osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) is of great importance in improving the treatment of osteoporosis. On the other hand, glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used to treat the chronic inflammatory disorders, but long-term exposure to GCs can induce osteoporosis. In present study, we treated BMSCs with dexamethasone (DEX) to simulate GC-induced osteoporosis. MTT assay, ALP activity, and Alizarin Red were used to evaluate the role miRNA-291a-3p in the DEX-induced osteogenic differentiation suppression. Further, we used qPCR and western blot to investigate the mechanisms of miRNA-291a-3p affecting BMSCs differentiation. The results showed that miRNA-291a-3p could improve the cell viability, osteogenic differentiation, and ALP activity, which are suppressed by DEX in BMSCs. Furthermore, we found that the osteogenesis genes Runx2, DMP1, and ALP were upregulated whereas the lipogenic genes C/EBPα and PPARγ were downregulated when miRNA-291a-3p mimics were transfected. Additionally, we demonstrated that miRNA-291a-3p promoted BMSCs' osteogenic differentiation by directly suppressing DKK1 mRNA and protein expression and subsequently activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our study suggests that miR-291a-3p plays an important role in preventing osteoporosis and may serve as a potential miRNA osteoporosis biomarker.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, the majority of mammary tumors from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are ERα-negative. To model ERα-positive breast cancer in mice, we exogenously introduced expression of mouse and human ERα in an existing GEMM of p53-deficient breast cancer. After initial ERα expression during mammary gland development, expression was reduced or lost in adult glands and p53-deficient mammary tumors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analysis of primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs) derived from these models, in which expression of the ERα constructs was induced in vitro, confirmed interaction of ERα with the DNA. In human breast and endometrial cancer, and also in healthy breast tissue, DNA binding of ERα is facilitated by the pioneer factor FOXA1. Surprisingly, the ERα binding sites identified in primary MMECs, but also in mouse mammary gland and uterus, showed an high enrichment of ERE motifs, but were devoid of Forkhead motifs. Furthermore, exogenous introduction of FOXA1 and GATA3 in ERα-expressing MMECs was not sufficient to promote ERα-responsiveness of these cells. Together, this suggests that species-specific differences in pioneer factor usage between mouse and human are dictated by the DNA sequence, resulting in ERα-dependencies in mice that are not FOXA1 driven. These species-specific differences in ERα-biology may limit the utility of mice for in vivo modeling of ERα-positive breast cancer.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we present a microfluidic Caenorhabditis elegans culture system with integrated luminescence-based oxygen sensing. The material used for the fabrication of the microfluidic chip is off-stoichiometry dual-cure thiol-ene-epoxy (OSTE+), which is well-suited for reliably recording on-chip oxygen consumption rates (OCR) due to its low gas permeability. With our microfluidic approach, it was possible to confine a single nematode in a culture chamber, starting from the L4 stage and studying it over a time span of up to 6 days. An automated protocol for successive worm feeding and OCR measurements during worm development was applied. We found an increase of OCR values from the L4 larval stage to adulthood, and a continuous decrease as the worm further ages. In addition, we performed a C. elegans metabolic assay in which exposure to the mitochondrial uncoupling agent FCCP increased the OCR by a factor of about two compared to basal respiration rates. Subsequent treatment with sodium azide inhibited completely mitochondrial respiration.</AbstractText>"}

The recently discovered IL-36 family members are involved in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and pulmonary diseases. Here, we show that IL-36α interacts with heme thereby contributing to its regulation. Based on in-depth spectroscopic analyses, we describe two heme-binding sites in IL-36α that associate with heme in a pentacoordinated fashion. Solution NMR analysis reveals structural features of IL-36α and its complex with heme. Structural investigation of a truncated IL-36α supports the notion that the N-terminus is necessary for association with its cognate receptor. Consistent with our structural studies, IL-36-mediated signal transduction was negatively regulated by heme in synovial fibroblast-like synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Taken together, our results provide a structural framework for heme-binding proteins and add IL-1 cytokines to the group of potentially heme-regulated proteins.</AbstractText>"}

In this work, the NIR acceptor was added to state-of-the-art PBDBT-2F:IT4F-based solar cells as a third component, leading to (i) an efficiency increase of the ternary devices compared to the binary solar cells in the presence of the highly crystalline COi8DFIC acceptor and (ii) much-improved photostability under 1-sun illumination. The electron transport properties were investigated and revealed the origin of the enhanced device performance. Compared to the binary cells, the optimized ternary PBDBT-2F:COi8DFIC:IT4F blends exhibit improved electron transport properties in the presence of 10% COi8DFIC, which is attributed to improved COi8DFIC molecular packing. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a slow recombination of charge carriers in the ternary blend. The improved electron transport properties were preserved in the ternary OSC upon aging, while in the binary devices they seriously deteriorated after simulated 1-sun illumination of 240 h.

Incidence and prevalence of VHD are high and increase as the population ages, creating the next epidemic. In Western countries, the etiology is mostly degenerative or functional disease and strikes an elderly population with multiple comorbidities. Epidemiological studies have shown that VHD is commonly underdiagnosed, leading to patients presenting late in their disease course, to an excess risk of mortality and morbidity and to a missed opportunity for intervention. Once diagnosed, VHD is often undertreated with patients unduly denied intervention, the only available curative treatment. This gap between current recommendations and clinical practice and the marked under-treatment is at least partially related to poor knowledge of current National and International Societies Guidelines. Development of a valvular heart team involving multidisciplinary valve specialists including clinicians, imaging specialists, interventional cardiologists and surgeons is expected to fill these gaps and to offer an integrated care addressing all issues of patient management from evaluation, risk-assessment, decision-making and performance of state-of-the-art surgical and transcatheter interventions.

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the diagnostic test accuracy of self-reported and/or self-administered frailty screening instruments against two widely accepted frailty reference standards (the frailty phenotype and the Frailty Index) within community-dwelling older adult populations. We carried out a systematic search of the Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, PEDro, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations, Open Grey and GreyLit databases up to April 2017 (with an updated search carried out over May-July 2018) to identify studies reporting comparison of self-reported and/or self-administered frailty screening instruments against an appropriate reference standard, with a minimum sensitivity threshold of 80% and specificity threshold of 60%. We identified 24 studies that met our selection criteria. Four self-reported screening instruments across three studies met minimum sensitivity and specificity thresholds. However, in most cases, study design considerations limited the reliability and generalizability of the results. Additionally, meta-analysis was not carried out, because no more than three studies were available for any of the unique combinations of index tests and reference standards.

This is more frequently observed in aging populations and patients with co-morbidities that can directly influence bone repair. Tremendous progress has been made in the development of biologics to enhance and accelerate the healing process; however, side-effects persist that can cause significant discomfort and tissue damage. This has been the impetus for the development of safe and natural strategies to hasten natural bone healing. Of the many possible approaches, nutrition represents a safe, affordable, and non-invasive strategy to positively influence each phase of fracture repair. However, our understanding of how healing can be hindered by malnutrition or enhanced with nutritional supplementation has lagged behind the advancements in both surgical management and the knowledge of molecular and cellular drivers of skeletal fracture repair. This review serves to bridge this knowledge gap as well as define the importance of nutrition during fracture healing. The extant literature clearly indicates that pre-existing nutritional deficiencies should be corrected, and nutritional status should be carefully monitored to prevent the development of malnutrition for the best possible healing outcome. It remains unclear, however, whether the provision of nutrients beyond sufficiency has any benefit on fracture repair and patient outcomes. The combined body of pre-clinical studies using a variety of animal models suggests a promising role of nutrition as an adjuvant therapy to facilitate fracture repair, but extensive research is needed, specifically at the clinical level, to clarify the utility of nutritional interventions in orthopedics. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Parasitoids were reared under either constant (continuous exposure at 25 ± 2°C) or fluctuating temperature conditions (i.e., 30 ± 2°C during day and 20 ± 2°C at night) during four consecutive generations. Our results indicated that tested fluctuating temperature is more suitable for rearing of T. podisi as such temperature condition not only resulted in fitness benefits (e.g., shorter developmental time, longer female longevity, higher fecundity/fertility) but also reduced (approximately 23.5%) the estimated costs for producing the parasitoids. Furthermore, rearing T. podisi under fluctuating temperatures improved tolerance to low constant temperatures (i.e., 20°C) without changing the tolerance to constant high temperatures (30°C) in the fourth generation. Surprisingly, even parasitoids that developed under fluctuating thermal conditions performed better than those reared at constant temperature of 25°C. Collectively, our findings suggest that T. podisi reared under fluctuating thermal condition can tolerate better fluctuating temperatures that normally occur both during long periods of transport and in agricultural ecosystems, which will increase the quality and productivity of mass-reared T. podisi for inundative releases.</AbstractText>"}

Although kidney pathology was observed in 87% CF rats and CPN in 62% of CF animals, no evidence of kidney disease was observed in MR rats. Consistent with the absence of renal pathology, urinary albumin levels were lower in the MR group compared to controls throughout the study, with over a six-fold difference between the groups at 30 months of age.

Ranging from cell-intrinsic and cell-type-specific regulation of innate inflammatory signaling pathways to intercellular cross talk through secretion of soluble factors (e.g., shaping the MHC immunopeptidome for T cell response, etc.), autophagy exerts multiple functions in driving inflammation and modulating the pathological progression of immune-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmunity, and metabolic diseases. Notably, owing to the complexity of autophagy process involving multiple proteins and stepwise assembly of protein complexes, noncanonical forms of autophagy or autophagic proteins, which function beyond autophagy, are equally important in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and pathogenesis.

Except for Ce, the higher the age, the lower the REE and Se content were. Smoking was positively associated with Dy, Er, and Yb levels, whereas drinking habits showed no significant effect on all the elements. Elderly individuals who ate smoked and pickled food and who consumed high amounts of salt had higher levels of REE and Se in their hair, and centenarians who consumed egg and milk had higher Se and REE in the hair than did the non-eaters.

During cell division, an incomplete copy of each chromosome's DNA is made, causing telomeres to shorten on successive generations. When a threshold length is reached replication ceases and the cell becomes 'senescent'. In this paper, we consider populations of telomeres and, from discrete models, we derive partial differential equations which describe how the distribution of telomere lengths evolves over many generations. We initially consider a population of cells each containing just a single telomere. We use continuum models to compare the effects of various mechanisms of telomere shortening and rates of cell division during normal ageing. For example, the rate (or probability) of cell replication may be fixed or it may decrease as the telomeres shorten. Furthermore, the length of telomere lost on each replication may be constant, or may decrease as the telomeres shorten. Where possible, explicit solutions for the evolution of the distribution of telomere lengths are presented. In other cases, expressions for the mean of the distribution are derived. We extend the models to describe cell populations in which each cell contains a distinct subpopulation of chromosomes. As for the simpler models, constant telomere shortening leads to a linear reduction in telomere length over time, whereas length-dependent shortening results in initially rapid telomere length reduction, slowing at later times. Our analysis also reveals that constant telomere loss leads to a Gaussian (normal) distribution of telomere lengths, whereas length-dependent loss leads to a log-normal distribution. We show that stochastic models, which include a replication probability, also lead to telomere length distributions which are skewed.</AbstractText>"}

Bone growth and mineralization occur during infancy and childhood, peak bone mass being attained after early adulthood. A low peak bone mass has consequences later in life, including increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Currently, more than 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis, with approximately 9 million fractures yearly. This poses a tremendous economic burden on health care. Between 5% and 10% of the elderly suffer from sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength, further increasing the risk of fractures due to falls. Evidence from interventional and observational studies support that fermented dairy products in particular exert beneficial effects on bone growth and mineralization, attenuation of bone loss, and reduce fracture risk. The effect cannot be explained by single nutrients in dairy, which suggests that a combined or matrix effect may be responsible similar to the matrix effects of foods on cardiometabolic health. Recently, several plant-based beverages and products have become available and marketed as substitutes for dairy products, even though their nutrient content differs substantially from dairy. Some of these products have been fortified, in efforts to mimic the nutritional profile of milk, but it is unknown whether the additives have the same bioavailability and beneficial effect as dairy. We conclude that the dairy matrix exerts an effect on bone and muscle health that is more than the sum of its nutrients, and we suggest that whole foods, not only single nutrients, need to be assessed in future observational and intervention studies of health outcomes. Furthermore, the importance of the matrix effect on health outcomes argues in favor of making future dietary guidelines food based.</AbstractText>"}

At the cellular level it is considered as an irreversible cell-cycle arrest commonly caused by the DNA damage. Senescent cells harbor a lot of impairments in various intracellular systems. Presence of senescent cells within tissues should ultimately lead to their malfunctioning. However, the interlink between cellular senescence and tissue/organismal functioning is far from always being unidirectional. The entangled and complex relationship between senescence and tissue-specific decidual differentiation of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) is the excellent example reflecting dualism of cellular senescence. ESCs decidualization conditions endometrium responsiveness to embryonic signals and plays a critical role in embryo biosensoring, selection and implantation. Based on the analysis of the existing literary data, here we will try (1) to puzzle out how cellular senescence simultaneously may be an integral part of normal decidualization and may be involved in the progression of repeated implantation failures and recurrent pregnancy losses; (2) to suppose the sequence of cellular events reflecting the role of ESCs' senescence during normal and impaired decidualization. Together, the deep scan of the interlink between ESCs' senescence and decidualization will allow to suggest the preferable application scheme for senolytics targeting senescent cells as a possible approach to restore impaired endometrial receptivity and thus to increase the effectiveness of in vitro fertilization cycles.</AbstractText>"}

Of the several risk factors that predict the onset and progression of ARCD, 2 important modifiable risk factors are diet and physical activity. Dietary patterns that emphasize plant foods can exert neuroprotective effects. In this comprehensive review, we examine studies in humans of plant-based dietary patterns and polyphenol-rich plant foods and their role in either preventing ARCD and/or improving cognitive function. As yet, there is no direct evidence to support the benefits of a vegetarian diet in preventing cognitive decline. However, there is emerging evidence for brain-health-promoting effects of several plant foods rich in polyphenols, anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, and plant-based dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet that include a variety of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. The bioactive compounds present in these dietary patterns include antioxidant vitamins, polyphenols, other phytochemicals, and unsaturated fatty acids. In animal models these nutrients and non-nutrients have been shown to enhance neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarize the mounting evidence in favor of plant-centered dietary patterns, inclusive of polyphenol-rich foods for cognitive well-being. Randomized clinical trials support the role of plant foods (citrus fruits, grapes, berries, cocoa, nuts, green tea, and coffee) in improving specific domains of cognition, most notably frontal executive function. We also identify knowledge gaps and recommend future studies to identify whether plant-exclusive diets have an added cognitive advantage compared with plant-centered diets with fish and/or small amounts of animal foods.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In addition, dietary modifications are powerful interventions to delay, prevent, or treat many aging-related diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Restricting amino acid and protein intake generally decreases aging-related comorbidities and thereby increases health and longevity. However, chronic dietary interventions are likely not feasible for most people due to low adherence to dietary protocols or resistance to drastic changes to lifestyle, and might even cause detrimental effects, possibly by negatively affecting the immune system and wound healing. The periodic use of low-protein, low-calorie fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) has the potential to promote health benefits, while minimizing the burden of chronic restriction. Protein restriction and FMDs together have the potential to play an important complementary role in medicine by promoting disease prevention and treatment, and by delaying the aging process at least in part by stimulating stem cell-based regeneration in periods of normal food intake after periodic FMD cycles. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize research on the impact of protein restriction on health and longevity in model organisms and to discuss the implementation of an FMD in mice and in human clinical trials and its effects on biomarkers of healthy aging. Taking into account the importance of sex on aging and diet, we include this information in all discussed studies.

Identifying simple strategies to promote healthy aging (i.e., absence of major chronic diseases, preserved physical and cognitive functions, intact mental health, and good quality of life) have emerged as a major public health concern. Identifying biomarkers to better characterize the aging process is a research priority. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends that prevent the loss of genomic DNA, protecting its physical integrity. Telomere length (TL) is considered a biomarker of aging: shorter telomeres are associated with a decreased life expectancy and increased rates of age-related chronic diseases. Telomere attrition has been shown to be accelerated by oxidative stress and inflammation. Since edible plants contain plenty of compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it is plausible that their sustained consumption might help counteract telomere attrition. In this narrative review, we update evidence on the association between plant-rich dietary patterns and plant-based foods and TL. First, we summarize findings from observational studies on the association between TL and 1) adherence to plant-rich dietary patterns (mainly, but not only, focused on the Mediterranean diet); 2) consumption of seeds (mostly focused on nuts, grains, and coffee); and 3) intake of carotenoids, one of the plant-derived bioactives most studied in health and disease. Second, we summarize the main randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect on TL of dietary interventions involving either plant-rich dietary patterns or plant foods. Even though evidence from trials is very limited, several observational studies have reinforced the suggestive benefits of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (a plant-rich dietary pattern), consumption of seeds (and its derivatives), and dietary intake of carotenoids on TL, which further supports the research benefits of plant-rich dietary patterns and plant foods to promote health and longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

For the vast majority of that time the focus has been on saturated fat, with or without concomitant guidance for total or unsaturated fat. Over the past few years there has been a renewed debate about the relation between dietary saturated fat and CVD risk, prompted by a series of systematic reviews that have come to what appears to be different conclusions. This triggered a robust discourse about this controversy in the media that in turn has led to confusion in the general public. The genesis of the different conclusions among the systematic reviews has been identified in several studies on the basis of isocaloric substitution analyses. When the data were analyzed on the basis of polyunsaturated fat replacing saturated fat, there was a positive relation between dietary saturated fat and CVD. When the data were analyzed on the basis of carbohydrate replacing saturated fat, there was a null relation between dietary saturated fat and CVD. When the substitution macronutrient was not taken into consideration, the differential effects of the macronutrient substitution went unrecognized and the relations judged as null. The lack of distinction among substituted macronutrients accounted for much of what appeared to be discrepancies. Dietary guidance consistent with replacing foods high in saturated fat with foods high in unsaturated fat, first recommended more than 50 y ago, remains appropriate to this day.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

During the dry season, all adults die and desiccation-resistant embryos remain encased in dry mud for months or years in a state of diapause where their development is halted in anticipation of the months that have to elapse before their habitats are flooded again. Embryonic development of annual killifishes deviates from canonical teleost development. Epiblast cells disperse during epiboly, and a 'dispersed phase' precedes gastrulation. In addition, annual fish have the ability to enter diapause and block embryonic development at the dispersed phase (diapause I), mid-somitogenesis (diapause II) and the final phase of development (diapause III). Developmental transitions associated with diapause entry and exit can be linked with cell cycle events. Here we set to image this transition in living embryos.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Results' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>To visibly explore cell cycle dynamics during killifish development in depth, we created a stable transgenic line in <i>Nothobranchius furzeri</i> that expresses two fluorescent reporters, one for the G<sub>1</sub> phase and one for the S/G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle, respectively (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator, FUCCI). Using this tool, we observed that, during epiboly, epiblast cells progressively become quiescent and exit the cell cycle. All embryos transit through a phase where dispersed cells migrate, without showing any mitotic activity, possibly blocked in the G<sub>1</sub> phase (diapause I). Thereafter, exit from diapause I is synchronous and cells enter directly into the S phase without transiting through G<sub>1</sub>. The developmental trajectories of embryos entering diapause and of those that continue to develop are different.

We believe that a long (relative to body weight) lifespan in individual rodent and primate species can be due, among other things, to the loss of particular genes that are present in short-lived species of the same orders. These genes can also explain the widely different rates of aging among diverse species as well as why similarly sized rodents or primates sometimes have anomalous life expectancies (e.g., naked mole-rats and humans). Here, we consider the gene loss in the context of the prediction of Williams' theory that concerns the reallocation of physiological resources of an organism between active reproduction (r-strategy) and self-maintenance (K-strategy). We have identified such lost genes using an original computer-aided approach; the software considers the loss of a gene as disruptions in gene orthology, local gene synteny or both.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Results' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>A method and software identifying the genes that are absent from a predefined <i>set</i> of species but present in another predefined <i>set</i> of species are suggested.

The program is universal towards these pairs, i.e., towards the underlying property, although the sets should include species with quality genome assemblies. Here, the proposed method was applied to study the longevity of Euarchontoglires species. It largely predicted genes that are highly expressed in the testis, epididymis, uterus, mammary glands, and the vomeronasal and other reproduction-related organs. This agrees with Williams' theory that hypothesizes a species transition from r-strategy to K-strategy. For instance, the method predicts the mouse gene <i>Smpd5</i>, which has an expression level 20 times greater in the testis than in organs unrelated to reproduction as experimentally demonstrated elsewhere.

Here, we show that aging hematopoietic progenitor cells particularly of the myeloid branch exhibit enhanced resistance to bulky DNA lesions-a relevant type of DNA damage induced by toxins such as cancer drugs or endogenous aldehydes. We identified aging-associated activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway to be connected to this phenotype. Inhibition of Hh signaling reverts DNA damage tolerance and DNA damage-resistant proliferation in aged hematopoietic progenitors. Vice versa, elevating Hh activity in young hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to impair DNA damage responses. Altogether, these findings provide experimental evidence for aging-associated increases in Hh activity driving DNA damage tolerance in myeloid progenitors and myeloid-skewed differentiation. Modulation of Hh activity could thus be explored as a therapeutic strategy to prevent DNA damage tolerance, myeloid skewing, and disease development in the aging hematopoietic system.</AbstractText>"}

An analysis using ecological theory to evaluate the process of microbial community assembly processes revealed that the microbiomes of the older group were formed under a greater influence of the niche-based process, with the network of microbes being more collapsed than that of the younger group. Inferred metagenomic functional pathways associated with replication and repair were relatively more predominant in the younger group whereas, among the various metabolism-related pathways, those associated with biodegradation were more predominant in the older group. Interestingly, we found two segregated sub-typing patterns in the younger group which were also observed in the skin microbiomes of young Chinese women living in four other cities in China. The results of our study highlights candidate microbes and functional pathways that are important for future research into preventing skin aging and which could lead to a comprehensive understanding of age-related skin microbiome characteristics.</AbstractText>"}

In dogs, there was a moderate correlation between age and the FI, and the distribution of the FI increased with age. Deficit accumulation was strongly related to mortality. The effect of age, when combined with the FI, was negligible. No sex-related differences were evident. The FI could be considered in epidemiological studies and/or experimental trials to account for the potential confounding effects of the health status of individual dogs. The age-related deficit accumulation reported in dogs is similar to that demonstrated in humans. Therefore, dogs might represent an excellent model for human aging studies.</AbstractText>"}

Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) is an established measure of mitochondrial function. OCR by mammalian oocytes and embryos has generally been restricted to overall uptake and detailed understanding of the components of OCR dedicated to specific molecular events remains lacking. Here, extracellular flux analysis (EFA) was applied to small groups of bovine, equine, mouse and human oocytes and bovine early embryos to measure OCR and its components. Using EFA, we report the changes in mitochondrial activity during the processes of oocyte maturation, fertilisation, and pre-implantation development to blastocyst stage in response to physiological demands in mammalian embryos. Crucially, we describe the real time partitioning of overall OCR to spare capacity, proton leak, non-mitochondrial and coupled respiration - showing that while activity changes over the course of development in response to physiological demand, the overall efficiency is unchanged. EFA is shown to be able to measure mitochondrial function in small groups of mammalian oocytes and embryos in a manner which is robust, rapid and easy to use. EFA is non-invasive and allows real-time determination of the impact of compounds on OCR, facilitating an assessment of the components of mitochondrial activity. This provides proof-of-concept for EFA as an accessible system with which to study mammalian oocyte and embryo metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

It is therefore necessary to uncover efficient biomarkers for early diagnosis, and to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying ccRCC progression and metastasis. Increased evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles during tumor progression.

The expression and oncogenic roles of ubiquitin specific peptidase 5 (USP5) have been reported in several cancers except EOC. In the current study, USP5 amplification was highly prevalent in patients with EOC and associated with higher mRNA expression of USP5. USP5 amplification and overexpression was positively correlated with poor prognosis of patients of ovarian serous carcinomas. Disruption of USP5 profoundly repressed cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest in ovarian cancer cells. Additionally, USP5 knockdown inhibited xenograft growth in nude mice. Knockdown of USP5 decreased histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) expression and increased p27 (an important cell cycle inhibitor) expression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The promoting effects of USP5 overexpression on cell proliferation and cell cycle transition, as well as the inhibitory effects of USP5 overexpression on p27 expression were mediated by HDAC2. Moreover, USP5 interacted with HDAC2, and disruption of USP5 enhanced the ubiquitination of HDAC2. HDAC2 protein was positively correlated USP5 protein, and negatively correlated with p27 protein in ovarian serous carcinomas tissues.

Millions of piRNAs have been discovered to date, and more than 20,000 piRNA genes have been found in the human genome. Due to the relatively small number of studies related to piRNA, our understanding of piRNAs is very limited. Currently, the clear biological function of piRNAs is transposon mobilization inhibition by promoting transcript degradation and regulating chromatin formation. In addition, piRNAs can form piRNA-PIWI protein complexes with some members of the PIWI branch of the Argonaute protein. Based on these biological functions, piRNAs and PIWI proteins are important in maintaining the genomic integrity of germline cells. Because of this, the popularity of piRNAs research has been focused on its role in germline cells for a long time after the discovery of piRNAs. As the field of research expands, there is growing evidence that piRNAs and PIWI proteins are abnormally expressed in various types of cancers, which may be potential cancer biomarkers and cancer therapeutic targets. In this review, we will focus on the relationship between piRNAs and PIWI proteins and cancers based on previous research, as well as their significance in cancer detection, grading and treatment.</AbstractText>"}

Premature aging syndromes, also known as progeroid syndromes, recapitulate many clinical features of normal aging and offer a unique opportunity to elucidate fundamental mechanisms that contribute to human aging. Progeroid syndromes can be broadly classified into those caused by perturbations of the nuclear lamina, a meshwork of proteins located underneath the inner nuclear membrane (laminopathies); and a second group that is caused by mutations that directly impair DNA replication and repair. We will focus mainly on laminopathies caused by incorrect processing of lamin A, an intermediate filament protein that resides at the nuclear periphery. Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria (HGPS) is an accelerated aging syndrome caused by a mutation in lamin A and one of the best studied laminopathies. HGPS patients exhibit clinical characteristics of premature aging, including alopecia, aberrant pigmentation, loss of subcutaneous fat and die in their teens as a result of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications. Here we summarize how cell- and mouse-based disease models provided mechanistic insights into human aging and discuss experimental strategies under consideration for the treatment of these rare genetic disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we isolated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from cortex, striatum and substantia nigra of wildtype (WT), PINK1 knockout (PINK1 KO) and Parkin knockout (Parkin KO) mice to analyze mtDNA heteroplasmy induced by PINK1/Parkin deficiency or aging. Our results showed that the Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) of late-onset somatic variants mainly increased with aging. Conversely, the early-onset somatic variants exhibited significant increase in the cortex and substantia nigra of PINK1 KO mice than WT mice of the same age. Increased average variant allele frequency was observed in aged PINK1 KO mice and in substantial nigra of aged Parkin KO mice than in WT mice. Cumulative variant allele frequency in the substantia nigra of PINK1 KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice, further supporting the pivotal role of PINK1 in mtDNA maintenance.

Both healthy and pathological aging are characterized by frequency-specific changes in oscillatory activity. However, the cognitive relevance of these changes across the spectrum from normal to pathological aging remains unknown. We examined electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of cognitive function in healthy aging and 2 of the most prominent and debilitating age-related disorders: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Relative to healthy controls (HC), patients with AD were impaired on nearly every cognitive measure, whereas patients with T2DM performed worse mainly on learning and memory tests. A continuum of alterations in resting-state EEG was associated with pathological aging, generally characterized by reduced alpha (α) and beta (β) power (AD &lt; T2DM &lt; HC) and increased delta (δ) and theta (θ) power (AD &gt; T2DM &gt; HC), with some variations across different brain regions. There were also reductions in the frequency and power density of the posterior dominant rhythm in AD. The ratio of (α + β)/(δ + θ) was specifically associated with cognitive function in a domain- and diagnosis-specific manner. The results thus captured both similarities and differences in the pathophysiology of cerebral oscillations in T2DM and AD. Overall, pathological brain aging is marked by a shift in oscillatory power from higher to lower frequencies, which can be captured by a single cognitively relevant measure of the ratio of (α + β) over (δ + θ) power.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several genetic studies have identified a rare variant of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) as a risk factor for AD. TREM2 is thought to trigger the microglial response to amyloid plaques. Mouse models have helped elucidate mechanisms through which TREM2 affects microglial function and modulates pathological features of AD. A synthesis of the 35 mouse-model studies included in this review indicates that TREM2 modulates amyloid plaque composition and deposition, microglial morphology and proliferation, neuroinflammation, and tau phosphorylation. TREM2 also acts as a sensor for anionic lipids exposed during neuronal apoptosis and Aβ deposition, may improve spatial abilities and memory, and protect against apoptosis. In early stages of AD, TREM2 knock-down reduces expression of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokines but in later stages, TREM2 may contribute to the disease by aggravating neuroinflammation. The results provide insight into TREM2-related mechanisms that may be associated with AD in humans and may aid future development of disease-modifying pharmacological treatments targeting TREM2.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The DemTect scores were associated with oxygen content, 6-min-walking distance (6-MWD), C-reactive protein (CRP), modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC) and the SGRQ impact score. Conversely, the SGRQ impact score was independently associated with 6-MWD, FVC, mMRC and DemTect. These results were combined into a path analysis model to account for direct and indirect effects. The DemTect score had a small, but independent impact on QoL, irrespective of the inclusion of COPD-specific influencing factors or a diagnosis of cognitive impairment.We conclude that in patients with stable COPD lower oxygen content of blood as a measure of peripheral oxygen supply, lower exercise capacity in terms of 6-MWD, and higher CRP levels were associated with reduced cognitive capacity. Furthermore, a reduction in cognitive capacity was associated with reduced disease-specific quality of life. As a potential clinical implication of this work, we suggest to screen especially patients with low oxygen content and low 6-MWD for cognitive impairment.</AbstractText>"}

In some individuals, these symptoms become chronic and persist in the long-term and can confer an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease and dementia diagnosis later in life. Despite the severity of its consequences, the pathophysiological mechanism of mTBI remains unknown. In this post-mortem case series, we assessed DNA damage-induced cellular senescence pathways in 38 professional athletes with a history of repeated mTBI and ten controls with no mTBI history. We assessed clinical presentation, neuropathological changes, load of DNA damage, morphological markers of cellular senescence, and expression of genes involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and cellular senescence including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Twenty-eight brains with past history of repeated mTBI history had DNA damage within ependymal cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. DNA damage burden was increased in brains with proteinopathy compared to those without. Cases also showed hallmark features of cellular senescence in glial cells including astrocytic swelling, beading of glial cell processes, loss of H3K27Me3 (trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3) and lamin B1 expression, and increased expression of cellular senescence and SASP pathways. Neurons showed a spectrum of changes including loss of emerin nuclear membrane expression, loss of Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1 or SMARCA4) expression, loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) axonal expression, and translocation of intranuclear tau to the cytoplasm. Expression of DNA repair proteins was decreased in mTBI brains. mTBI brains showed substantial evidence of DNA damage and cellular senescence. Decreased expression of DNA repair genes suggests inefficient DNA repair pathways in this cohort, conferring susceptibly to cellular senescence and subsequent brain dysfunction after mTBI. We therefore suggest that brains of contact-sports athletes are characterized by deficient DNA repair and DNA damage-induced cellular senescence and propose that this may affect neurons and be the driver of brain dysfunction in mTBI, predisposing the progression to neurodegenerative diseases. This study provides novel targets for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and represents viable targets for future treatments.</AbstractText>"}

Interestingly, exercise has been proposed as a potential therapeutic intervention to improve brain health and reduce the risk for dementia, however the benefits throughout aging are not well understood.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>To better understand the effects of exercise, we preformed transcriptional profiling on young (1-2 months) and midlife (12 months) C57BL/6 J (B6) male mice after 12 weeks of voluntary running. Data was compared to age-matched sedentary controls. Interestingly, the midlife running group naturally broke into two cohorts based on distance ran - either running a lot and more intensely (high runners) or running less and less intensely (low runners). Midlife high runners had lower LDL cholesterol as well as lower adiposity (%fat) compared to sedentary, than midlife low runners compared to sedentary suggesting more intense running lowered systemic markers of risk for age-related diseases including dementias. Differential gene analysis of transcriptional profiles generated from the cortex and hippocampus showed thousands of differentially expressed (DE) genes when comparing young runners to sedentary controls. However, only a few hundred genes were DE comparing either midlife high runners or midlife low runners to midlife sedentary controls. This indicates that, in our study, the effects of running are reduced through aging. Gene set enrichment analyses identified enrichment of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular remodeling and angiogenesis in young runners but not midlife runners. These genes are known to be expressed in multiple vascular-related cell types including astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Taken together these results suggest running may best serve as a preventative measure to reduce risk for cerebrovascular decline.

Many of these individuals experience greater rates of chronic diseases and lower income levels compared to their urban-residing counterparts. Aging in rural environments creates greater challenges in the provision of funding, staff and resources to meet the needs of these older adults, and contributes to immense health disparities and health inequities. Urban and rural older adult residents alike need healthcare, gerontological and public health resources to promote successful aging in place. Due to the nature of rural environments, many of these resources often exist great distances from these residents, which creates access challenges. There are also limitations in locally available facilities and trained practitioners, resulting in resource shortages for addressing chronic health conditions. The creation and use of interdisciplinary partnerships provides this much-needed support while addressing ever-increasing funding and staffing limitations. This article provides an innovative conceptual interdisciplinary partnership model that combines nursing, public health and gerontology to address the health and social challenges that rural-residing older adults face. Although well-trained practitioners who work within their discipline are an important contributor to assist with the needs of rural-residing older adults, this silo approach is expensive, inefficient, and clearly cannot support all of the needs for older adults in this type of environment. There is a need to blend the complementary skills provided by each of the presented disciplines so that the focus of the interdisciplinary partnership is on person-centered care addressing the health disparities and health inequities experienced by these older adults. To illustrate the integration of nursing, public health and gerontology disciplines, these disciplines are initially combined and presented as dyads, and are then incorporated into the full conceptual model. The dyads are public health and gerontology, public health and nursing, and gerontology and nursing. Steps are provided for the development of this (or any) interdisciplinary partnership. An example of the model's use through clinical and non-clinical disciplines and a community engagement framework is also described. Interdisciplinary approaches focused on person-centered care provide more well-rounded health and social support for rural older adults than any one discipline in isolation. Allocation of shared resources, roles, responsibilities and expenses allows practitioners engaged in interdisciplinary teams to provide superior economic and capacity efficiency. This efficiency is crucial at a time when many entities experience limitations in sustainable resources. Thus, practitioners and community agencies collaborating through interdisciplinary partnerships are better able to address the complex issues experienced by rural-residing community members.</AbstractText>"}

In the absence of curative treatment, preventive strategies to delay or reduce progression of dementia are crucial. This relies on the identification of modifiable risk factors. The effects of dementia on sleep are well recognized; however, there is now growing evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship between sleep pathologies and dementia. SDB, poor quality sleep and extremes of sleep duration are commonly experienced by both middle-aged and older populations. All have been associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline in a number of observational studies, albeit inconsistently. The mechanisms by which these sleep disorders may contribute to neurodegeneration are manifold, and include impacts of fragmented sleep on the clearance of neurotoxins, and in SDB by the additive effects of intermittent hypoxia on beta-amyloid production, hypoxic cell death, neuroinflammation and damage to cerebral vasculature. Untangling the mechanisms by which sleep pathologies may impact risk of dementia is a challenge. Many insights into the pathophysiology of these relationships have been derived from animal- and population-based studies. Neuroimaging modalities offer important opportunities to further understand the link between sleep pathologies and dementia risk in vivo, especially in the critical preclinical phase of AD. In this review, we canvas updates in dementia pathophysiology, the evidence linking sleep pathologies with dementia and outline the advances in determining this potential pathophysiological link that have eventuated from the application of neuroimaging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

A clear age-dependent increased prevalence of sarcopenia and OBSP has been registered in CHF patients, suggesting mechanistic relationships. Development of OBSP could be mediated by a crosstalk between the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) and the skeletal muscle under conditions of low-grade local and systemic inflammation, inflammaging. The present review summarizes the emerging data supporting the idea that inflammaging may serve as a mutual mechanism governing the development of sarcopenia, OBSP and ACVDs. In support of this hypothesis, various immune cells release pro-inflammatory mediators in the skeletal muscle and myocardium. Subsequently, the endothelial structure is disrupted, and cellular processes, such as mitochondrial activity, mitophagy, and autophagy are impaired. Inflamed myocytes lose their contractile properties, which is characteristic of sarcopenia and CHF. Inflammation may increase the risk of ACVD events in a hyperlipidemia-independent manner. Significant reduction of ACVD event rates, without the lowering of plasma lipids, following a specific targeting of key pro-inflammatory cytokines confirms a key role of inflammation in ACVD pathogenesis. Gut dysbiosis, an imbalanced gut microbial community, is known to be deeply involved in the pathogenesis of age-associated sarcopenia and ACVDs by inducing and supporting inflammaging. Dysbiosis induces the production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which is implicated in atherosclerosis, thrombosis, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and poor CHF prognosis. In OBSP, AT dysfunction and inflammation induce, in concert with dysbiosis, lipotoxicity and other pathophysiological processes, thus exacerbating sarcopenia and CHF. Administration of specialized, inflammation pro-resolving mediators has been shown to ameliorate the inflammatory manifestations. Considering all these findings, we hypothesize that sarcopenia, OBSP, CHF and dysbiosis are inflammaging-oriented disorders, whereby inflammaging is common and most probably the causative mechanism driving their pathogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We found that serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D] levels were significantly decreased in aging Cyp27b1<sup>+/-</sup> mice, which displayed an osteoporotic phenotype. This was accompanied by a reduction of expression of the B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) insertion region 1 (Bmi1) at both gene and protein levels. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a luciferase reporter assay, we then showed that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> upregulated Bmi1 expression at a transcriptional level via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). To determine whether Bmi1 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could correct bone loss induced by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D deficiency, we overexpressed Bmi1 in MSCs using Prx1-driven Bmi1 transgenic mice (Bmi1<sup>Tg</sup> ) mice. We then compared the bone phenotypes of Bmi1<sup>Tg</sup> mice on a Cyp27b1<sup>+/-</sup> background, with those of Cyp27b1<sup>+/-</sup> mice and with those of WT mice, all at 8 months of age. We found that overexpression of Bmi1 in MSCs corrected the bone phenotype of Cyp27b1<sup>+/-</sup> mice by increasing osteoblastic bone formation, reducing osteoclastic bone resorption, increasing bone volume, and increasing bone mineral density. Bmi1 overexpression in MSCs also corrected 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D deficiency-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, and cellular senescence of Cyp27b1<sup>+/-</sup> mice by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevating serum total superoxide dismutase levels, reducing the percentage of γH<sub>2</sub> A.X, p16, IL-1β, and TNF-α-positive cells and decreasing γH2A.X, p16, p19, p53, p21, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression levels. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, both ex vivo and in vitro, from WT mice but not from Bmi1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D administration in vivo increased osteoblastic bone formation in WT, but not in Bmi1 <sup>-/-</sup> mice.

BAFF signals through receptors on B cells, making it an attractive molecule to potentiate vaccine-induced B cell responses. We hypothesized that a rabies virus (RABV)-based vaccine displaying both antigen and BAFF on the surface of the same virus particle would target antigen-specific B cells for activation and improve RABV-specific antibody responses. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a recombinant RABV-based vector expressing virus membrane-anchored murine BAFF (RABV-ED51-mBAFF). BAFF was incorporated into the RABV particle and determined to be biologically functional, as demonstrated by increased B cell survival of primary murine B cells treated ex-vivo with RABV-ED51-mBAFF. B cell survival was inhibited by pre-treating RABV-ED51-mBAFF with an antibody that blocks BAFF functions. RABV-ED51-mBAFF also activated primary murine B cells ex-vivo more effectively than RABV as shown by significant upregulation of CD69, CD40, and MHCII on the surface of infected B cells. In-vivo, RABV-ED51-mBAFF induced significantly faster and higher virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers than RABV while not adversely affecting the longevity of the vaccine-induced antibody response. Since BAFF was incorporated into the virus particle and genome replication was not required for BAFF expression in-vivo, we hypothesized that RABV-ED51-mBAFF would be effective as an inactivated vaccine. Mice immunized with 250 ng/mouse of β-propriolactone-inactivated RABV-ED51-mBAFF showed faster and higher anti-RABV VNA titers compared to mice immunized with inactivated RABV. Together, this model stands as a potential foundation for exploring other virus membrane-anchored molecular adjuvants to make safer, more effective inactivated RABV-based vaccines.</AbstractText>"}

Previous work suggests that the balance between the two decision systems is impaired in psychiatric disorders such as compulsion and addiction, via overreliance on MF control. However, little is known whether the balance can be altered through task training. Here, 20 healthy participants performed a well-established two-step task that differentiates MB from MF control, across five training sessions. We used computational modelling and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to assess changes in decision-making and brain hemodynamic over time. Mixed-effects modelling revealed overall no substantial changes in MF and MB behavior across training. Although our behavioral and brain findings show task-induced changes in learning rates, these parameters have no direct relation to either MF or MB control or the balance between the two systems, and thus do not support the assumption of training effects on MF or MB strategies. Our findings indicate that training on the two-step paradigm in its current form does not support a shift in the balance between MF and MB control.

This paper proposes a novel brain functional connectivity imaging method, particularly targeting the contribution of nonlinear dynamics of functional connectivity, on distinguishing participants with AD from healthy controls (HC). We describe a parametric method established upon a Nonlinear Finite Impulse Response model, and a revised orthogonal least squares algorithm used to estimate the linear, nonlinear and combined connectivity between any two EEG channels without fitting a full model. This approach, where linear and non-linear interactions and their spatial distribution and dynamics can be estimated independently, offered us the means to dissect the dynamic brain network disruption in AD from a new perspective and to gain some insight into the dynamic behaviour of brain networks in two age groups (above and below 70) with normal cognitive function. Although linear and stationary connectivity dominates the classification contributions, quantitative results have demonstrated that nonlinear and dynamic connectivity can significantly improve the classification.</AbstractText>"}

Various pathological bone loss situations result from the overactivated osteoclastogenesis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-activated NF-κB and MAPK pathways is vital for osteoclastogenesis. Here, we for the first time explored the effects of l-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP), an active alkaloid derived from corydalis, on the formation and function of osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. In RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow monocytes cells (BMMCs), l-THP inhibited osteoclastic differentiation at the early stage, down-regulated transcription level of osteoclastogenesis-related genes and impaired osteoclasts functions. Mechanically, Western blot showed that l-THP inhibited the phosphorylation of P50, P65, IκB, ERK, JNK and P38, and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that DNA binding activity of NF-κB was suppressed, ultimately inhibiting the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1). Besides, Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that l-THP blocked the interactions of RANK and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) at an upstream site. In vivo, l-THP significantly inhibited ovariectomy-induced bone loss and osteoclastogenesis in mice. Collectively, our study demonstrated that l-THP suppressed osteoclastogenesis by blocking RANK-TRAF6 interactions and inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK pathways. l-THP is a promising agent for treating osteoclastogenesis-related diseases such as post-menopausal osteoporosis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

TrBTIC has excellent solubility in common solvents and features good energy level matching with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Interestingly, P3HT can be readily dissolved in warm 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), a green solvent, but crystallizes slowly with long-term aging in TMB at room temperature. A prephase separation can thus occur before active blend film deposition, and the separation degree can be easily controlled by varying the aging time. After 40 min of aging, the resulting active blend has the most appropriate phase separation with uniform nanowires, which forms favorable interpenetrating networks for exciton dissociation and charge transport. As a result, the device performance is improved from 6.62% to 8.25%. Excitingly, 8.25% is a new record for P3HT-based solar cells. The study not only provides an efficient nonfullerene acceptor for matching P3HT donors but also develops a promising processing technology to realize high-performance P3HT-based polymer solar cells with an efficiency over 8%.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

As opioid receptors are found in both the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) nuclei of the amygdala, we investigated the effects of morphine microinjection on evoked pain responses, pain-motivated behaviors, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and descending modulation in rats with left-side spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Morphine administered into the right or left CeA had no effect on nerve injury-induced tactile allodynia or mechanical hyperalgesia. Right, but not left, CeA morphine produced conditioned place preference (CPP) and increased extracellular dopamine in the NAc selectively in SNL rats, suggesting relief of aversive qualities of ongoing pain. In SNL rats, CPP and NAc dopamine release following right CeA morphine was abolished by blocking mu opioid receptor signaling in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Right CeA morphine also significantly restored SNL-induced loss of the diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, a spino-bulbo-spinal pain modulatory mechanism, termed conditioned pain modulation in humans. Microinjection of morphine into the BLA had no effects on evoked behaviors and did not produce CPP in nerve-injured rats. These findings demonstrate that the amygdalar action of morphine is specific to the right CeA contralateral to the side of injury and results in enhancement of net descending inhibition. In addition, engagement of mu opioid receptors in the right CeA modulates affective qualities of ongoing pain through endogenous opioid neurotransmission within the rACC, revealing opioid-dependent functional connections from the CeA to the rACC.</AbstractText>"}

OAT1 plays a pivotal role in drug clearance. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are observed more frequently in women than in men, especially ADR are higher in women for drugs which are known interactors of OAT1. Sex-dependent expression of Oat1 has been observed in rodents with a tendency to male-dominant expression. This study aims at elucidating the transcriptional regulation of human OAT1 and tests the effect of estrogen receptor α (ERα). Promoter activation of OAT1 was assessed by luciferase assays carried out by Opossum kidney (OK) cells, transiently transfected with promoter constructs of human OAT1 and expression vectors for ERα and exposed to 100 nmol/L 17β-estradiol. Furthermore, a transcription factor array and proteomic analysis was performed to identify estrogen-induced transcription factors. Human OAT1 was significantly activated by ligand activated ERα. However, activation occurred without a direct interaction of ERα with the OAT1 promoter. Our data rather show an activation of the transcription factors CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor (CBF) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) by ERα, which in turn bind and initiate OAT1 promoter activity. Herewith, we provide novel evidence of estrogen-dependent, transcriptional regulation of polyspecific drug transporters including the estrogen-induced transcription factors CBF and HNRNPK.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

MCI is a label used to identify individuals with the symptoms of cognitive deterioration not attributable to 'normal ageing' but deemed to be 'at risk' of developing AD despite clinical uncertainty around whether individuals will go on to develop the condition in the future. Drawing on qualitative data gathered across an out-patient memory service, this article examines practitioners' accounts of the complexity associated with constructing the boundaries around MCI, AD and age in the clinic. Practitioners utilise uncertainty by classifying patients with MCI to keep them on for review to account for the possibility that patients may go on to develop AD but they also recognise the difficulty in predicting future progression to AD. Negotiating classification boundaries in the clinic is, however, not only about managing uncertainty regarding potential future risk but also about navigating the wider social and political context in which ageing and cognitive deterioration intersect, and are constructed and managed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author.

We tested whether modulating the expression of klotho influenced the response of mouse muscles to acute injury. Our findings show that klotho expression in muscle declines at 3 days post-injury. That reduction in klotho expression coincided with elevated expression of targets of Wnt signalling (Ccnd1; Myc) and increased MyoD<sup>+</sup> muscle cell numbers, reflecting the onset of myogenic cell differentiation. klotho expression subsequently increased at 7 days post-injury with elevated expression occurring primarily in inflammatory lesions, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Wnt target genes (Ccnd1: 91%; Myc: 96%). Introduction of a klotho transgene maintained high levels of klotho expression over the course of muscle repair and attenuated the increases in Ccnd1 and Myc expression that occurred at 3 days post-injury. Correspondingly, transgene expression reduced Wnt signalling in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells, reflected by reductions in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells expressing active β-catenin, and reduced the numbers of MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells at 3 days post-injury. At 21 days post-injury, muscles in klotho transgenic mice showed increased Pax7<sup>+</sup> and decreased myogenin<sup>+</sup> cell densities and large increases in myofibre size. Likewise, treating myogenic cells in vitro with Klotho reduced Myod expression but did not affect Pax7 expression. Muscle inflammation was only slightly modulated by increased klotho expression, initially reducing the expression of M2-biased macrophage markers Cd163 and Cd206 at 3 days post-injury and later increasing the expression of pan-macrophage marker F480 and Cd68 at 21 days post-injury.

Participants studied 2 lists of exemplars from either the same category or different categories and recalled from one list. During recall, participants reported all words that came to mind and made source monitoring judgments. Both groups initiated first retrievals similarly from primacy positions on delayed tests, but older adults initiated first retrievals from later recency positions on immediate tests. Older adults took longer on average to initiate subsequent retrievals, especially when recalling from List 1 and when exemplars from the same category appeared in both lists. Further, trial-level analyses showed that retrieval latencies were longer when fewer responses were produced, and older adults produced fewer responses. When response production was equated, retrieval latencies were more comparable for both age groups. Finally, when lists included exemplars from the same category, older adults produced intrusions earlier and monitored them less effectively on immediate tests, but both age groups showed near-perfect intrusion monitoring when lists included exemplars from different categories.

One of its possible consequences is the perception that others are not to be trusted and are a source of wrongdoing, defined as cynical hostility. At the same time, cynical hostility could also deter individuals from seeking the comfort of close social relationships. We use the Health and Retirement Study to test a cross-lagged model of hostility and loneliness in a sample of 7500 older adults. The results suggest that there are bidirectional associations between hostility and loneliness.

In this study, we used fibrillin-1 hypomorphic and haploinsufficient mice (Fbn1<sup>mgr/mgR</sup> and Fbn1<sup>+/-</sup> mice, respectively) to investigate the impact of fibrillin-1 deficiency alone or in combination with regular physical activity on tendon tissue morphology and mechanical properties. Morphological and biomechanical analyses revealed that Fbn1<sup>mgr/mgR</sup> but not Fbn1<sup>+/-</sup> mice displayed smaller tendons with physical properties that were unremarkable when normalized to tendon size. Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice (n = 43) Fbn1<sup>+/-</sup> mice (n = 27) and wild-type mice (WT, n = 25) were randomly assigned to either control cage conditions (n = 54) or to a running on a running wheel for 4 weeks (n = 41). Both fibrillin-1-deficient mice ran voluntarily on the running wheel in a manner similar to WT mice (3-4 km/24 h). Regular exercise did not mitigate aneurysm progression in Fbn1<sup>mgR/mgR</sup> mice (P &lt; 0.05) as evidenced by unmodified median survival. In spite of the smaller size, tendons of fibrillin-1-deficient mice subjected to regular exercise showed no evidence of overt histopathological changes or tissue overload. We therefore concluded that lack of optimal fibrillin-1 synthesis leads to a down regulation of integrated tendon formation, rather than to a loss of tendon quality, which also implies that fibrillin-1 deficiency in combination with exercise is not a suitable animal model for studying the development of tendon overuse (tendinopathy).</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Studies suggest that aging is caused by the accumulation of free radicals. Lack of physical activity can lower hormone levels and increase free radicals that can accelerate the aging process. Hence, physical activity is very important to maintain functions of organs. This research was aimed to study the effects of low and moderate treadmill exercise on d-Galactose-exposed aging rat model by evaluating the degree of hepatic fibrosis, number of M1 and M2, and M1/M2 ratio. Twenty-four 3-month-old male Wistar aging model rats were randomly divided into four groups, that is, three treatment groups with daily 300 mg kgBW<sup>-1</sup> d-Galactose injection administrated intraperitoneally for 4 weeks and 1 control group with normal saline injection. Two of the d-Galactose treated groups were given low and moderate treadmill exercise for 4 weeks. It was concluded that low intensity treadmill exercise significantly lowered the degree of d-Galactose-exposed hepatic fibrosis, and moderate treadmill exercise was able to restore the injured liver tissue back to the non-aging state. Administration of d-Galactose causes inflammation marked by the elevated number of M1 and M2 macrophages. Moderate treadmill exercise drove M1/M2 ratio back to the control condition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Epigenetic aging evaluates DNA methylation at a suite of distinct CpG sites in the genome, and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) is linked to heightened chronic morbidity and mortality risks in adults. Consequently, EAA provides insights on trajectories of biological aging, which early life experiences may help shape. However, few studies have measured correlates of children's epigenetic aging, especially outside of the U.S. and Europe. In particular, little is known about how children's growth and development relate to EAA in ecologies in which energetic and pathogenic stressors are commonplace. We studied EAA from dried blood spots among Bondongo children (n = 54) residing in a small-scale, fisher-farmer society in a remote region of the Republic of the Congo. Here, infectious disease burdens and their resultant energy demands are high. Children who were heavier for height or taller for age, respectively, exhibited greater EAA, including intrinsic EAA, which is considered to measure EAA internal to cells. Furthermore, we found that children in families with more conflict between parents had greater intrinsic EAA. These results suggest that in contexts in which limited energy must be allocated to competing demands, more investment in growth may coincide with greater EAA, which parallels findings in European children who do not face similar energetic constraints. Our findings also indicate that associations between adverse family environments and greater intrinsic EAA were nonetheless observable but only after adjustment for covariates relevant to the energetically and immunologically demanding nature of the local ecology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","Date":"Nov 13 2019","Keywords":"APOE, Bioinformatics, Human genetics, Longevity","Abstract":"<AbstractText>APOE is a well-studied gene with multiple effects on aging and longevity. The gene has three alleles: e2, e3, and e4, whose frequencies vary by ethnicity. While the e2 is associated with healthy cognitive aging, the e4 allele is associated with Alzheimer's disease and early mortality and therefore its prevalence among people with extreme longevity (EL) is low. Using the PopCluster algorithm, we identified several ethnically different clusters in which the effect of the e2 and e4 alleles on EL changed substantially. For example, PopCluster discovered a large group of 1,309 subjects enriched of Southern Italian genetic ancestry with weaker protective effect of e2 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, p = .14) and weaker damaging effect of e4 (OR = 0.82, p = .31) on the phenotype of EL compared to other European ethnicities. Further analysis of this cluster suggests that the odds for EL in carriers of the e4 allele with Southern Italian genetic ancestry differ depending on whether they live in the United States (OR = 0.29, p = .009) or Italy (OR = 1.21, p = .38). PopCluster also found clusters enriched of subjects with Danish ancestry with varying effect of e2 on EL. The country of residence (Denmark or United States) appears to change the odds for EL in the e2 carriers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","Date":"Nov 13 2019","Keywords":"Human Aging, Longevity, Mortality","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Interventions meant to promote longevity and healthy aging have often been designed or observed to modulate very specific gene or protein targets. If there are naturally occurring genetic variants in such a target that affect longevity as well as the molecular function of that target (eg, the variants influence the expression of the target, acting as 'expression quantitative trait loci' or 'eQTLs'), this could support a causal relationship between the pharmacologic modulation of the target and longevity and thereby validate the target at some level. We considered the gene targets of many pharmacologic interventions hypothesized to enhance human longevity and explored how many variants there are in those targets that affect gene function (eg, as expression quantitative trait loci). We also determined whether variants in genes associated with longevity-related phenotypes affect gene function or are in linkage disequilibrium with variants that do, and whether pharmacologic studies point to compounds exhibiting activity against those genes. Our results are somewhat ambiguous, suggesting that integrating genetic association study results with functional genomic and pharmacologic studies is necessary to shed light on genetically mediated targets for longevity-enhancing drugs. Such integration will require more sophisticated data sets, phenotypic definitions, and bioinformatics approaches to be useful.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study, a computed estimate of BA was investigated longitudinally in 3,558 individuals using deep phenotyping, which encompassed a broad range of biological processes. The Klemera-Doubal algorithm was applied to longitudinal data consisting of genetic, clinical laboratory, metabolomic, and proteomic assays from individuals undergoing a wellness program. BA was elevated relative to CA in the presence of chronic diseases. We observed a significantly lower rate of change than the expected ~1 year/year (to which the estimation algorithm was constrained) in BA for individuals participating in a wellness program. This observation suggests that BA is modifiable and suggests that a lower BA relative to CA may be a sign of healthy aging. Measures of metabolic health, inflammation, and toxin bioaccumulation were strong predictors of BA. BA estimation from deep phenotyping was seen to change in the direction expected for both positive and negative health conditions. We believe BA represents a general and interpretable 'metric for wellness' that may aid in monitoring aging over time.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

We estimate inequalities in diabetes incidence, prevalence and mortality and assess the economic burden on the healthcare system in Costa Rica. The main source of data is the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study, a longitudinal nationally representative survey of the elderly population (n = 2827). Data analyses include descriptive statistics, multiple regression models and survival analysis models. More than a fifth of Costa Rican elderly experience diabetes. Incidence is estimated at 5 per 1000 person-years in the population 30+. Gender and geographical inequalities were found. Men have a significantly lower prevalence (16.51% vs 24.02%, P &lt; 0.05) and incidence (4.3 vs 6.0 per 1000 person-years, P &lt; 0.05), but higher mortality (hazard ratio = 1.31, P &lt; 0.01). Longer time to the closest facility translates into a lower probability of having the condition diagnosed [odds ratio (OR) = 0.77, P &lt; 0.05]. The diabetic as compared to the non-diabetic population imposes a larger economic burden on the healthcare system with a higher probability of using outpatient care (OR = 3.08, P &lt; 0.01), medications (OR = 3.44, P &lt; 0.01) and hospitalizations (OR = 1.24, P &gt; 0.05). Individuals living in the Metro Area have a significantly lower probability of being hospitalized (OR = 0.72, P &lt; 0.05), which may be evidence of better access to primary care that prevents hospitalization. Along the same line, women have higher utilization rates of outpatient care (OR = 2.02, P &lt; 0.01) and medications (OR = 1.73, P &lt; 0.01), which may contribute to lower odds of hospitalization (OR = 0.61, P &lt; 0.01). Aligned with the aim of attaining Sustainable Development Goals, this study highlights the importance of generating health policies focused on prevention of diabetes that take into consideration gender and geographical inequalities. Strategies should booster preventive healthcare utilization by men and aim to make healthcare services accessible to all, regardless of geographical location.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The RRS has become an essential part of the medical system worldwide, supported by all major quality improvement organizations. An RRS consists of a trigger system and response team and needs constant assessment and process improvement. Although the effectiveness and cost-benefit of RRS remain controversial, according to previous studies, it may be beneficial by decreasing in-hospital cardiac arrest and mortality. Since the first implementation of RRS in Korea in 2008, it has been developed in over 15 medical centers and continues to expand.

This paper presents an image deblurring and super-resolution framework for PET using anatomical guidance provided by high-resolution MR images. The framework relies on image-domain post-processing of already-reconstructed PET images by means of spatially-variant deconvolution stabilized by an MR-based joint entropy penalty function. The method is validated through simulation studies based on the BrainWeb digital phantom, experimental studies based on the Hoffman phantom, and clinical neuroimaging studies pertaining to aging and Alzheimer's disease. The developed technique was compared with direct deconvolution and deconvolution stabilized by a quadratic difference penalty, a total variation penalty, and a Bowsher penalty. The BrainWeb simulation study showed improved image quality and quantitative accuracy measured by contrast-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, root-mean-square error, and peak signal-to-noise ratio generated by this technique. The Hoffman phantom study indicated noticeable improvement in the structural similarity index (relative to the MR image) and gray-to-white contrast-to-noise ratio. Finally, clinical amyloid and tau imaging studies for Alzheimer's disease showed lowering of the coefficient of variation in several key brain regions associated with two target pathologies.</AbstractText>"}

Increased telomere attrition rates, and relatively shorter telomere length, is associated with genomic instability and has been linked with several chronic diseases, malignancies and reduced longevity. Telomeric DNA is highly susceptible to oxidative damage and dietary habits may make an impact on telomere attrition rates through the mediation of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine the association between leucocyte telomere length (LTL) with both the Dietary Inflammatory Index<sup>®</sup> 2014 (DII<sup>®</sup>) and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010). This is a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from 263 postmenopausal women from the Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial, in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. No statistically significant association was detected between LTL <i>z</i>-score and the AHEI-2010 (<i>P</i> = 0·20) or DII<sup>®</sup> (<i>P</i> = 0·91) in multivariable adjusted models. An exploratory analysis of AHEI-2010 and DII<sup>®</sup> parameters and LTL revealed anthocyanidin intake was associated with LTL (<i>P</i> &lt; 0·01); however, this association was non-significant after a Bonferroni correction was applied (<i>P</i> = 0·27). No effect modification by age, smoking history, or recreational physical activity was detected for either relationship.

These groups were subdivided according to adhesive system used: self-etching adhesive Adper Easy One (3M/ESPE) and etch-and-rinse adhesive Single Bond (3M/ESPE). The composite resin blocks were fabricated using a Teflon matrix. A thermomechanical cycling machine was used to carry out the artificial aging of the specimens and thus were sectioned into sticks. The microtensile tests were performed using a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. Data (in MPa) were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests (5%). <b>Results</b>: Significant differences were found for both factors tested and interactions (p&lt;0.05). Tukey's test results of µTBS (mean ± SD) were: etch-and-rinse SE (28.79±3.93); DE (30.41±7.22); AS (29.03±3.33); NaF (29.81±4.06)a; Ic (29.47±5.5);  and self-etching SE (30.37±6.96); DE (14.62±4.47); AS (9.79±2.32); NaF (9.36±2.31); Ic (30.78±8.68).   <b>Conclusions:</b> Resin infiltration did not affect the bond strength of demineralized enamel for both adhesive systems tested. For etch-and-rinse adhesive, no differences were observed for the tested groups. For self-etching adhesive, only the resin-infiltrated group showed similar bond strength to sound enamel. Both etch-and-rinse and self-etching adhesive systems can be used in resin-infiltrated enamel, if a composite restoration needs to be further performed. In enamel that has undergone the de/remineralization process, the use of a total-etch adhesive might be preferable for the restorative procedure.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Borges AB et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The results of recent clinical and basic studies have suggested that vascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, affect the pathogenesis of dementia. Cerebrovascular damage due to vascular risk factors directly triggers vascular dementia, and it is becoming more apparent that vascular risk factors also increase the risk of neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins in the brain. Although disease-modifying therapy for dementia has not yet been established, several studies have shown that the management of vascular risk factors could possibly contribute to reducing the risk of developing dementia, thus making them important targets for dementia prevention. In this article, we review recent findings regarding the relationship between vascular risk factors and dementia, especially focusing on Alzheimer's disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms, and the potential strategies targeting these modifiable risk factors to prevent cognitive decline.</AbstractText>"}

Sleep can also be impacted by a variety of adverse events, including childhood adversity. Here we examined how early life adverse events impacted later life sleep structure and physiology using an animal model to test the relationship between early life adversity and sleep quality across the life span. Rat pups were exposed to an Adversity-Scarcity model from postnatal day 8-12, where insufficient bedding for nest building induces maternal maltreatment of pups. Polysomnography and sleep physiology were assessed in weaning, early adult and older adults. Early life adversity induced age-dependent disruptions in sleep and behavior, including lifelong spindle decreases and later life NREM sleep fragmentation. Given the importance of sleep in cognitive and emotional functions, these results highlight an important factor driving variation in sleep, cognition and emotion throughout the lifespan that suggest age-appropriate and trauma informed treatment of sleep problems.</AbstractText>"}

Complex network theory provides a variety of features that help in the evaluation of network behavior. However, such analysis can be confusing and misleading as there are many intrinsic properties for each network metric. Alternatively, Information Theory methods have gained the spotlight because of their ability to create a quantitative and robust characterization of such networks. In this work, we use two Information Theory quantifiers, namely Network Entropy and Network Fisher Information Measure, to analyzing those networks. Our approach detects non-trivial characteristics of complex networks such as the transition present in the Watts-Strogatz model from k-ring to random graphs; the phase transition from a disconnected to an almost surely connected network when we increase the linking probability of Erdős-Rényi model; distinct phases of scale-free networks when considering a non-linear preferential attachment, fitness, and aging features alongside the configuration model with a pure power-law degree distribution. Finally, we analyze the numerical results for real networks, contrasting our findings with traditional complex network methods. In conclusion, we present an efficient method that ignites the debate on network characterization.</AbstractText>"}

Due to a lack of biomechanical data, the human dura mater is underrepresented in head models. This study provides tensile data of 73 fresh human cranial dura mater samples retrieved from an area between the anterior middle and the posterior middle meningeal artery. Tissues were adapted to their native water content using the osmotic stress technique. Tensile tests were conducted under quasi-static uniaxial testing conditions with simultaneous digital image correlation. Human temporal dura mater is mechanically highly variable with regards to its elastic modulus of 70 ± 44 MPa, tensile strength of 7 ± 4 MPa, and maximum strain of 11 ± 3 percent. Mechanical properties of the dura mater did not vary significantly between side nor sex and decreased with the age of the cadaver. Both elastic modulus and tensile strength appear to have constant mechanical parameters within the first 139 hours post mortem. The mechanical properties provided by this study can help to improve computational and physical human head models. These properties under quasi-static conditions do not require adjustments for side nor sex, whereas adjustments of tensile properties accompanied with normal aging may be of interest.</AbstractText>"}

While thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, attributing RNA-based roles to lncRNA loci requires assessing whether phenotype(s) could be due to DNA regulatory elements, transcription, or the lncRNA. Here, we use the conserved X chromosome lncRNA locus Firre, as a model to discriminate between DNA- and RNA-mediated effects in vivo. We demonstrate that (i) Firre mutant mice have cell-specific hematopoietic phenotypes, and (ii) upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide, mice overexpressing Firre exhibit increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired survival. (iii) Deletion of Firre does not result in changes in local gene expression, but rather in changes on autosomes that can be rescued by expression of transgenic Firre RNA. Together, our results provide genetic evidence that the Firre locus produces a trans-acting lncRNA that has physiological roles in hematopoiesis.</AbstractText>"}

In the present study, we investigated the plausibility of the involvement of microRNAs in the manifestation of this effect of royal jelly. The expression of microRNAs was determined by PCR array analysis and real-time PCR and the number of cells was counted with a cell counter. Using PCR array, we identified four microRNAs that were downregulated by royal jelly in cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). Upon comparison of the expression of the four microRNAs between young and senescent facial skin, miR-129-5p was found to be significantly upregulated in senescent skin. Consistently, the expression of miR-129-5p in HDMEC was significantly increased by UVB radiation, suggesting that this microRNA is related to photoaging. The royal jelly treatment increased the number of HDMEC. Furthermore, forced overexpression of miR-129-5p resulted in significant decrease in the number of HDMEC, and its forced downregulation increased the number of cells. The number and density of vessels is reported to be decreased in aged skin. Our results indicate that miR-129-5p is induced in damaged endothelial cells upon exposure to UV radiation, which decreases the cell number. Furthermore, administration of royal jelly downregulated the expression of miR-129-5p in endothelial cells, and might prevent skin aging by maintaining the number of cells. The present study elucidates the mechanism of vessel aging caused by UV exposure and the anti-aging effects of royal jelly through the involvement of microRNA.</AbstractText>"}

However, there was no clear association between appendiceal fibrosis and aging.

Flow cytometric analysis clearly identified a lymphocyte population in the appendix at 5 days, 45 and 75 years of age, and lymphoid follicles were also confirmed histologically. In contrast, lymphoid population was rarely detectable in the appendix at 79 and 80 years of age, and no lymphoid follicles were present histologically. Interestingly, cytograms from a case at 5 days of age suggested the existence of immature immune cells, as forward scatter showed an increase in cell size of the lymphocyte population. Histological analysis in UC patients found submucosal fat in the appendix of a case 66 years of age. Lymphoid follicular formation and mucosal structure were disrupted in cases of 70 and 72 years of age. UC patients may be more susceptible to steatotic change. Cytograms from appendices of UC patients also supported these histological findings. Our study confirms previous results that lymphoid tissues in the appendix degenerate over time, and proposes that inflammatory insult may facilitate the degenerative process in patients with UC.</AbstractText>"}

In recent years, several strategies have been tested in vitro to induce apatite precipitation within interfibrillar and intrafibrillar collagen spaces, as well as in resin-sparse regions where the adhesive infiltration was incomplete. Also, the presence of calcium ions and other metallic ions has shown an inhibitory effect on enzymatic activity. Ion-releasing particles and biomimetic analogs have been studied for hybrid layer remineralization. Overall, remineralization strategy is dependent on the remaining mineral content. In partially demineralized dentin, residual apatite crystallites serve as nucleation sites for calcium and phosphate ions precipitation and crystal growth ('top-down' remineralization). In completely demineralized dentin where crystallites are absent (e.g., acid etched dentin) the use of mineral nano-precursors assisted by non-collagenous proteins analogs are necessary ('bottom-up' remineralization).

Among all cell types, aged fibroblasts showed most significant differential gene expression, increased RNA dynamics, and network entropy. Aged fibroblasts exhibited significantly changed expression patterns of inflammatory, extracellular matrix organization angiogenesis, and osteogenic genes. Functional analyses indicated deterioration of paracrine signatures between fibroblasts and endothelial cells in old hearts. Aged heart-derived fibroblasts had impaired endothelial cell angiogenesis and autophagy and augmented proinflammatory response. In particular, expression of Serpine1 and Serpine2 were significantly increased and secreted by old fibroblasts to exert antiangiogenic effects on endothelial cells, an effect that could be significantly prevented by using neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, we found an enlarged subpopulation of aged fibroblasts expressing osteoblast genes in the epicardial layer associated with increased calcification. Taken together this study provides system-wide insights and identifies molecular changes of aging cardiac fibroblasts, which may contribute to declined heart function.</AbstractText>"}

Despite extensive research on the pathogen, a comprehensive understanding of how <i>Shigella</i> initiates contact with epithelial cells remains unknown. <i>Shigella</i> maintains many of the same <i>Escherichia coli</i> adherence gene operons; however, at least one critical gene component in each operon is currently annotated as a pseudogene in reference genomes. These annotations, coupled with a lack of structures upon microscopic analysis following growth in laboratory media, have led the field to hypothesize that <i>Shigella</i> is unable to produce fimbriae or other traditional adherence factors. Nevertheless, our previous analyses have demonstrated that a combination of bile salts and glucose induces both biofilm formation and adherence to colonic epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to perform transcriptomic and genetic analyses to demonstrate that adherence gene operons in <i>Shigella flexneri</i> strain 2457T are functional, despite the gene annotations. Our results demonstrate that at least three structural genes facilitate <i>S. flexneri</i> 2457T adherence for epithelial cell contact and biofilm formation.

Although skin cold stimulation (SCS) facilitates instantaneous muscle activity, which occurs during walking, the effects of SCS on muscle activity during walking remain unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of SCS during walking in older adults.<b>Methods:</b> Seventeen community-dwelling healthy older adults (73 ± 6 years old) participated in this study. Walking speed at a comfortable pace and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris (BF) were measured. SCS, which maintains the skin temperature at 25 °C, was applied to the front of the thigh during the procedures. Walking speed, root mean square EMG (rmsEMG) and mean power frequency (MPF) were compared under SCS and control conditions.<b>Results:</b> SCS significantly increased the walking speed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and the rmsEMG of the vastus lateralis (<i>p</i> = 0.032). No change in the rmsEMG of the BF was observed, and SCS had no effect on MPF of both the VL and BF. Furthermore, a significant relationship was observed between these changes (<i>r</i> = 0.619, <i>p</i> = 0.042).<b>Conclusion:</b> SCS increased the EMG activity of the VL while increasing walking speed.

To replicate the mechanisms and multifaceted complexities of human TBI and develop prospective therapeutic treatments, various TBI animal models have been developed. These models have been essential in furthering our understanding of the pathophysiology and biochemical effects on brain mechanisms following TBI. Despite these advances, translating preclinical results to clinical application, particularly in elderly individuals, continues to be challenging. This review aims to provide a clinical perspective, identifying relevant variables currently not replicated in TBI animal models, to potentially improve translation to clinical practice, especially as it applies to elderly populations. As background for this clinical perspective, we reviewed articles indexed on PubMed from 1970 to 2019 that used aged animal models for studying TBI. These studies examined end points relevant for clinical translation, such as neurocognitive effects, sensorimotor behavior, physiological mechanisms, and efficacy of neuroprotective therapies. However, compared with the higher incidence of TBI in older individuals, animal studies on the basic science of aging and TBI remain remarkably scarce. Moreover, a fundamental disconnect remains between experiments in animal models of TBI and successful translation of findings for treating the older TBI population. In this article, we aim to provide a clinical perspective on the unique attributes of TBI in older individuals and a critical appraisal of the research to date on TBI in aged animal models as well as recommendations for future studies.</AbstractText>"}

Relational learning was impaired in the two older adult groups, but transitive expression was facilitated by prior semantic knowledge of relations. Prior semantic knowledge did not improve novel inference for aMCI individuals. Schematic scaffolding can successfully support inference in preclinical cognitive decline, but such cognitive support may no longer be useful later in the disease process when dysfunction in neural circuitry may be too severe.

Clinical trials showed that nutritional supplements had positive effects on muscle mass, but not on muscle function and strength, demonstrating our limited understanding of the molecular events involved in the ageing muscle. Protein homeostasis, the equilibrium between protein synthesis and degradation, is proposed as the major mechanism underlying the development of sarcopenia. As the key central regulator of protein homeostasis, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is proposed to be essential for muscle hypertrophy. Paradoxically, sustained activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is associated with a loss of sensitivity to extracellular signaling in the elderly. It is not understood why sustained mTORC1 activity, which should induce muscle hypertrophy, instead results in muscle atrophy. Here, recent findings on the implications of disrupting protein homeostasis on muscle physiology and sarcopenia development in the context of mTOR/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling are reviewed. Understanding the role of these molecular mechanisms during the ageing process will contribute towards the development of targeted therapies that will improve protein metabolism and reduce sarcopenia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

One particular m5C modification of 25S ribosomal RNA, which is introduced by Rcm1p, was previously shown to modulate stress responses and lifespan in yeast and other small organisms. Here, we report that NSUN5 is the functional orthologue of Rcm1p, introducing m5C3782 into human and m5C3438 into mouse 28S ribosomal RNA. Haploinsufficiency of the NSUN5 gene in fibroblasts from William Beuren syndrome patients causes partial loss of this modification. The N-terminal domain of NSUN5 is required for targeting to nucleoli, while two evolutionary highly conserved cysteines mediate catalysis. Phenotypic consequences of NSUN5 deficiency in mammalian cells include decreased proliferation and size, which can be attributed to a reduction in total protein synthesis by altered ribosomes. Strikingly, Nsun5 knockout in mice causes decreased body weight and lean mass without alterations in food intake, as well as a trend towards reduced protein synthesis in several tissues. Together, our findings emphasize the importance of single RNA modifications for ribosome function and normal cellular and organismal physiology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

TC-NER is initiated by lesion-stalled RNA polymerase II, which stabilizes the interaction with the SNF2/SWI2 ATPase CSB to facilitate recruitment of the CSA E3 Cullin ubiquitin ligase complex. However, the precise biochemical connections between CSA and CSB are unknown. The small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO is important in the DNA damage response. We found that CSB, among an extensive set of other target proteins, is the most dynamically SUMOylated substrate in response to UV irradiation. Inhibiting SUMOylation reduced the accumulation of CSB at local sites of UV irradiation and reduced recovery of RNA synthesis. Interestingly, CSA is required for the efficient clearance of SUMOylated CSB. However, subsequent proteomic analysis of CSA-dependent ubiquitinated substrates revealed that CSA does not ubiquitinate CSB in a UV-dependent manner. Surprisingly, we found that CSA is required for the ubiquitination of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, RPB1. Combined, our results indicate that the CSA, CSB, RNA polymerase II triad is coordinated by ubiquitin and SUMO in response to UV irradiation. Furthermore, our work provides a resource of SUMO targets regulated in response to UV or ionizing radiation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the role of statins in the treatment of diabetes-related depression has not been well examined. Herein, we investigated the effects of lovastatin (LOV) on depressive phenotypes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The data suggested that the treatment of LOV at 10 or 20 mg/kg for 3 weeks markedly prevented diabetes-associated depressive behaviors reflected by better performance in the sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, and novelty-suppressed feeding test. The study further showed that these treatments improved the hippocampal neurogenesis as evidenced by increased bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the dentate gyrus with higher expression of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor and increased phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein. As expected, diabetic mice treated with LOV showed significant improvement of hyperlipidemia rather than hyperglycemia.

We assume that this regime is the product of a delicate balance between symmetric divisions that, after each cell cycle, originates a new stem cell or its disappearance (through cell differentiation). This dynamics leads to a monoclonal population, that is for an initial homogeneous set of stem cells, fixation of each clone is equiprobable. In this work we show that if there is an altered stem cell with a longer cell cycle than the rest, the fixation of this altered clone is more likely. We also study the consequeces of the appearance of successive alterations with these characteristics and their fixations. This effect is purely due to inherent characteristics of the cell renewal dynamics and as time goes by it leads to a quiescence state for stem cells owing to the recurrent fixation of such altered cells. Therefore it would contribute to the aging process.</AbstractText>"}

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal","Date":"Feb 27 2020","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>In this study, we investigate the photo-/thermal degradation mechanism of hybrid perovskites by using x-ray photoelectron (XPS) valence band (VB) spectra coupling with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Herein, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> is respectively subjected to irradiation with visible light and annealing at an exposure of 0-1000 h. It is found from XPS survey spectra that, in both cases (irradiation and annealing), a decrease in the I:Pb ratio is observed with aging time, which unambiguously indicates the formation of PbI<sub>2</sub> as the product of photo/thermal degradation. The comparison of the XPS VB spectra of irradiated and annealed perovskites with the DFT calculations of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and PbI<sub>2</sub> compounds have showed a systematic decrease in the contribution of I-5p states, which allows us to determine the respective threshold for degradation, which is 500 h for light irradiation and 200 h for annealing. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that the relaxation of thermal excitations of the system is carried out only by the phonons (which are non-radiative physical processes) while the radiative processes occurred during the photoexcitation will elastically or inelastically divert part of the external energy from the system to reduce its impact on perovskite degradation.</AbstractText>"}

TDP-43 inclusions correlate with cell loss and distribute beyond the UMN and LMN system. It has been proposed that phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) disseminates in a sequential pattern along the motor pathways, as suggested by the hypothesis of corticofugal ('prion-like') propagation of misfolded proteins in ALS.</AbstractText>"}

Individual in-depth interviews with 10 adults aged 65 years and older gathered rich descriptions of their experiences. Data collection and analyses were iterative processes. The experience of exercise was inextricably connected with older adults' chronic back pain. The essence of embodied relief from pain offered by exercise was considered through themes reflecting the restoration of existential coherence-enjoying exercise experiences, social engagement, gratitude, learned latitudes, maintaining mobility, and aging. Understanding that older adults can live in their bodies pain-free for some time with regular physical activity may endorse adherence to exercise participation for maintained or improved well-being.</AbstractText>"}

Those cP-containing RNAs (cP-RNAs) form a hidden layer of transcriptome because standard RNA-seq cannot capture them as a result of cP's prevention of an adapter ligation reaction. Here we provide genome-wide analyses of short cP-RNA transcriptome across multiple mouse tissues. Using cP-RNA-seq that can exclusively sequence cP-RNAs, we identified numerous novel cP-RNA species which are mainly derived from cytoplasmic tRNAs, mRNAs, and rRNAs. Determination of the processing sites of substrate RNAs for cP-RNA generation revealed highly-specific RNA cleavage events between cytidine and adenosine in cP-RNA biogenesis. cP-RNAs were not evenly derived from the overall region of substrate RNAs but rather from specific sites, implying that cP-RNAs are not from random degradation but are produced through a regulated biogenesis pathway. The identified cP-RNAs were abundantly accumulated in mouse tissues, and the expression levels of cP-RNAs showed age-dependent reduction. These analyses of cP-RNA transcriptome unravel a novel, abundant class of non-coding RNAs whose expression could have physiological roles.</AbstractText>"}

Senescent cell is characterized by the marked morphological changes and active metabolism along with a distinctive senescence associated secretion phenotype (SASP). Cellular senescence is triggered by multiple endogenous and exogenous stressors, which collectively induce three types of senescence. It is believed that senescence represents a programmed phenomenon to facilitate β cell functional maturation and, therefore, senescence has been suggested to be involved in β cell regeneration, insulin secretion and diabetes development. Nevertheless, despite past extensive studies, the exact impact of senescence on β cell viability, regeneration and functionality, and its relevance to the development of diabetes are yet to be fully addressed. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in β cell senescence, through which we intend to spark more instructive discussion and perspective with regard to the mechanisms underlying β cell senescence and their links to the pathogenesis of diabetes and the development of therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>"}

Key abnormalities driving cardiovascular risk in old age include endothelial dysfunction, increased arterial stiffness, blood pressure, and the pro-atherosclerotic effects of chronic, low-grade, inflammation. The identification of novel therapies that comprehensively target these alterations might lead to a major breakthrough in cardiovascular risk management in the older population. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that methotrexate, a first-line synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, significantly reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a human model of systemic inflammation, premature atherosclerosis, and vascular aging. We reviewed in vitro and in vivo studies investigating the effects of methotrexate on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure, and the potential mechanisms of action involved. The available evidence suggests that methotrexate might have beneficial effects on vascular homeostasis and blood pressure control by targeting specific inflammatory pathways, adenosine metabolism, and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. Such effects might be biologically and clinically relevant not only in patients with rheumatoid arthritis but also in older adults with high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, methotrexate has the potential to be repurposed for cardiovascular risk management in old age because of its putative pharmacological effects on inflammation, vascular homeostasis, and blood pressure. However, further study and confirmation of these effects are essential in order to adequately design intervention studies of methotrexate in the older population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In particular, persistent low-grade inflammation may disrupt the brain endothelial barrier and cause a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cells into the cerebral tissue that, in turn, leads to microglia dysfunction and loss of neuroprotective properties. Nowadays, growing evidence highlights a strong association between persistent peripheral inflammation, as well as metabolic alterations, and neurodegenerative disorder susceptibility. The identification of common pathways involved in the development of these diseases, which modulate the signalling and immune response, is an important goal of ongoing research. The aim of this review is to elucidate which inflammation-related molecules are robustly associated with the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Of note, peripheral biomarkers may represent direct measures of pathophysiologic processes common of aging and neuroinflammatory processes. In addition, molecular changes associated with the neurodegenerative process might be present many decades before the disease onset. Therefore, the identification of a comprehensive markers panel, closely related to neuroinflammation, could be helpful for the early diagnosis, and the identification of therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In humans, different studies at both site-specific and genome-wide levels have reported that modifications of DNA methylation are associated with the chronological aging process but also with the quality of aging (or biological aging), providing new perspectives for establishing powerful biomarkers of aging. In this article, the role of DNA methylation in aging and longevity has been reviewed by analysing literature data about DNA methylation variations occurring during the lifetime in response to environmental factors and genetic background, and their association with the aging process and, in particular, with the quality of aging. Special attention has been devoted to the relationship between nuclear DNA methylation patterns, mitochondrial DNA epigenetic modifications, and longevity. Mitochondrial DNA has recently been reported to modulate global DNA methylation levels of the nuclear genome during the lifetime, and, in spite of the previous belief, it has been found to be the target of methylation modifications. Analysis of DNA methylation profiles across lifetime shows that a remodeling of the methylome occurs with age and/or with age-related decline. Thus, it can be an excellent biomarker of aging and of the individual decline and frailty status. The knowledge about the mechanisms underlying these modifications is crucial since it might allow the opportunity for targeted treatment to modulate the rate of aging and longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

They are the best example of extreme longevity, representing selected individuals in which the appearance of major age-related diseases has been consistently delayed or avoided. There is growing evidence that the genetic component of longevity becomes higher with survival at the age of over 90 years. For centenaries, it reaches up to 33% for women and 48% for men. Therefore, exceptional longevity is a complex, hereditable trait that runs across generations.

This study evaluates the generalizability of four device-specific criteria, as recommended by the recent MedtechHTA project, of learning curve, incremental innovation, dynamic pricing, and organizational impact with a broader group of MDs including diagnostics and implantables. The purpose was to determine the applicability of these criteria to a broader range of MDs.<b>Areas Covered</b>: We determined the extent to which these criteria could be applied to each device type and attempted to identify common themes. We performed a literature search using PubMed and Google of a range of devices to understand the clinical significance, operation, and economic viability.<b>Expert Opinion</b>: Our findings suggest that the four characteristics are not applicable to all device types. Prior evaluation of a device's intrinsic properties (such as longevity and device location) and its FDA risk classification could help to indicate the applicability of the criteria.

Different processes in different tissues mediate this lifespan extension, with a set of interplays that remain unclear. We here show that, in Drosophila, reduced IIS activity modulates methionine metabolism, through tissue-specific regulation of glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), and that this regulation is required for full IIS-mediated longevity. Furthermore, fat body-specific expression of Gnmt was sufficient to extend lifespan. Targeted metabolomics showed that reducing IIS activity led to a Gnmt-dependent increase in spermidine levels. We also show that both spermidine treatment and reduced IIS activity are sufficient to extend the lifespan of Drosophila, but only in the presence of Gnmt. This extension of lifespan was associated with increased levels of autophagy. Finally, we found that increased expression of Gnmt occurs in the liver of liver-specific IRS1 KO mice and is thus an evolutionarily conserved response to reduced IIS. The discovery of Gnmt and spermidine as tissue-specific modulators of IIS-mediated longevity may aid in developing future therapeutic treatments to ameliorate aging and prevent disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In vitro models suggest that targeting RuvBL1 could be an effective strategy against HCC. However, the role of RuvBL1 in the onset and progression of HCC remains unknown. To address this question, we developed a RuvBL1<sup>hep+/-</sup> mouse model and evaluated the outcome of DEN-induced liver carcinogenesis up to 12 months of progression. We found that RuvBL1 haploinsufficiency initially delayed the onset of liver cancer, due to a reduced hepatocyte turnover in RuvBL1<sup>hep+/-</sup> mice. However, RuvBL1<sup>hep+/-</sup> mice eventually developed HCC nodules that, with aging, grew larger than in the control mice. Moreover, RuvBL1<sup>hep+/-</sup> mice developed hepatic insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. We could determine that RuvBL1 regulates insulin signaling through the Akt/mTOR pathway in liver physiology in vivo as well as in normal hepatocytic and HCC cells in vitro. Whole transcriptome analysis of mice livers confirmed the major role of RuvBL1 in the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. Finally, RuvBL1 expression was found significantly correlated to glucose metabolism and mTOR signaling by bioinformatic analysis of human HCC sample from the publicly available TGCA database. These data uncover a role of RuvBL1 at the intersection of liver metabolism, hepatocyte proliferation and HCC development, providing a molecular rationale for its overexpression in liver cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It has been demonstrated that healthy women have blunted cardiovagal baroreflx sensitivity during a rapid (i.e., within seconds) hypertensive stimulus, but baroreflex sensitivity is similar between the sexes during a hypotensive stimulus. Normal aging decreases cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and the rate of decline is similar in men and women. Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity is reduced in pathological conditions such as hypertension and type II diabetes, and the reduction is greater in female patients than male patients. There is no clear sex difference in sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity among young individuals, however, with women of more advanced age, sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity decreases, which appears to be associated with greater arterial stiffness compared with similarly aged men.

However, the mechanism(s) responsible for inflammaging and its causal role in aging and age-related diseases are not well understood. Age-associated accumulation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is an important trigger in inflammation and has been proposed as a potential driver of inflammaging. DAMPs can initiate an inflammatory response by binding to the cell surface receptors on innate immune cells. Programmed necrosis, termed necroptosis, is one of the pathways that can release DAMPs, and cell death due to necroptosis is known to induce inflammation. Necroptosis-mediated inflammation plays an important role in a variety of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and atherosclerosis. Recently, it was reported that markers of necroptosis increase with age in mice and that dietary restriction, which retards aging and increases lifespan, reduces necroptosis and inflammation. Genetic manipulations that increase lifespan (Ames Dwarf mice) and reduce lifespan (Sod1<sup>-/-</sup> mice) are associated with reduced and increased necroptosis and inflammation, respectively. While necroptosis evolved to protect cells/tissues from invading pathogens, e.g., viruses, we propose that the age-related increase in oxidative stress, mTOR signaling, and cell senescence results in cells/tissues in old animals being more prone to undergo necroptosis thereby releasing DAMPs, which contribute to the chronic inflammation observed with age. Approach to decrease DAMPs release by reducing/blocking necroptosis is a potentially new approach to reduce inflammaging, retard aging, and improve healthspan.</AbstractText>"}

Following stroke, TGF-β induces astrocyte activation and subsequent glial scar development. This is dysregulated with aging and could lead to chronic, detrimental changes within the basement membrane. We hypothesized that TGF-β induces basement membrane fibrosis after stroke, leading to impaired perivascular CSF distribution and poor functional recovery in aged animals. We found that CSF entered the aged brain along perivascular tracts; this process was reduced by experimental stroke and was rescued by TGF-β receptor inhibition. Brain fibronectin levels increased with experimental stroke, which was reversed with inhibitor treatment. Exogenous TGF-β stimulation increased fibronectin expression, both in vivo and in primary cultured astrocytes. Oxygen-glucose deprivation of cultured astrocytes induced multiple changes in genes related to astrocyte activation and extracellular matrix production. Finally, in stroke patients, we found that serum TGF-β levels correlated with poorer functional outcomes, suggesting that serum levels may act as a biomarker for functional recovery. These results support a potential new treatment strategy to enhance recovery in elderly stroke patients.</AbstractText>"}

However, realizing spontaneous and additional unpowered transport of underwater air bubbles inside tubes remains challenging. Although superhydrophilic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tubes are attracting attention as air bubble repellents, superhydrophilic PDMS, which is fabricated via oxygen plasma treatment, has a disadvantage in that it is weak against aging. Here, we present a tube with the ability to self-remove air bubbles, which overcomes the drawback of rapid aging. PDMS containing Silwet L-77 with a hierarchical nano-microstructure exhibiting subaqueous aerophobicity was fabricated. We conducted adherence and saturation experiments of air bubbles using the fabricated PDMS tube with Silwet L-77 to investigate the mechanism of bubbles adhering to and separating from the fabricated tube surface. The developed PDMS with Silwet L-77 exhibits a strong self-removal effect with an air bubble removal of 97.7%. The adherence and saturation experiments suggest that the transparent superhydrophilic-underwater aerophobic PDMS is a potentially exceptional tool for spontaneously separating air bubbles attached to tube surfaces.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

At the same time, policy makers throughout Europe and North America are trying to expand the use of home care over institutional services. Thus, the number of people combining caregiving responsibilities with paid work is growing. We investigate the conflicts that arise from this by exploring the time costs of unpaid care and how caregiving time is traded off against time in paid work and leisure in three distinct policy contexts. We analyze how these tradeoffs differ for men and women (age 50-74), using time diary data from Sweden, the UK and Canada from 2000 to 2015. Results show that women provide more unpaid care in each country, but the impact of unpaid care on labor supply is similar for male and female caregivers. Caregivers in the UK and Canada, particularly those involved in intensive caregiving, reduce paid work in order to provide unpaid care. Caregivers in Sweden do not trade off time in paid work with time in caregiving, but they have less leisure time. Our findings support the idea that the more extensive social infrastructure for caring in Sweden may diminish the labor market effects of unpaid care, but highlight that throughout contexts, intensive caregivers make important labor and leisure tradeoffs. Respite care and financial support policies are important for caregivers who are decreasing labor and leisure time to provide unpaid care.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Muscle attachment scars (entheses) are widely considered as indicators of habitual activity and many attempts have been made to use them for this purpose. However, their interpretation remains equivocal due to methodological limitations and a paucity of empirical data supporting an interaction between systematic muscle forces and entheseal morphology. We have recently addressed the first issue with precise three-dimensional measuring protocols and rigorous multivariate analysis focusing on the patterns among different entheses rather than comparing each entheseal structure separately. In a previous study, the resulting entheseal correlations reflected synergistic muscle groups that separated individuals according to their lifelong occupational activities. Here we address the second issue by applying this methodology to existing micro-computed tomography data from rats that have undergone muscle stimulation under experimental conditions. In contrast to previous animal studies, we relied on blind analytical procedures across two research institutions and controlled for most factors of interindividual variability. Results demonstrated that the multivariate associations among different entheseal surfaces can directly reflect repetitive muscle recruitment and provide essential information on muscle use.</AbstractText>"}

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent deacetylase in the proximal tubule, may be involved in renal injury associated with ageing. However, the mechanisms of SIRT1 regulation remain to be elucidated. We recently reported that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-associated protein (ATRAP)-deficient mice displayed age-associated renal function decline and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Our data showed that SIRT1 protein expression was reduced in ATRAP-deficient mice, although the relationship between ATRAP deficiency and age-associated renal fibrosis is still not fully understood. It is, therefore, necessary to investigate how ATRAP affects SIRT1 protein expression to resolve ageing-associated kidney dysfunction. Here, since ageing studies are inherently lengthy, we used an ex vivo model of the proximal tubule to determine the role of ATRAP in SIRT1 protein expression. We first generated a clonal immortalised human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line (ciRPTEC) expressing AT1R and ATRAP. Using this cell line, we demonstrated that ATRAP knockdown reduced SIRT1 protein expression in the ciRPTEC but did not alter SIRT1 mRNA expression. Thus, ATRAP likely mediates SIRT1 protein abundance in ciRPTEC.</AbstractText>"}

Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received 50 mg/kg of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally and 100 mg/kg of KRG or vehicle orally once a day for 14 days. Pole, Rotarod and Morris water maze tests were performed and the brains were collected after the last behavioral test. Changes in the numbers of BrdU- and BrdU/doublecortin (DCX; a marker for neuronal precursor cells and immature neurons)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and the gene expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker for cell differentiation), cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus were then investigated. KRG-treated mice came down the pole significantly faster and stood on the rotarod longer than vehicle-treated mice. The Morris water maze test showed that KRG administration enhanced the learning and memory abilities significantly.

Therefore, the hypothesis underlining the modulation of the innate and the adaptive immune system in the events linked to brain deposition of misfolded proteins could open new perspectives in the setting of specific immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we have reviewed the pathogenic hypothesis in neurodegenerative pathologies, underling the links between the deposition of misfolded protein mechanisms and the immune activation.</AbstractText>"}

However, the effects of a novel circRNA termed circGRAMD1B in human gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. A microarray was used to screen circRNA expression in GC. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of circGRAMD1B. Gain- and loss- of-function experiments were performed to investigate the biological functions of circGRAMD1B in vitro and vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down assay, and rescue experiments were conducted to confirm the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). We screened differentially expressed circRNAs and found that circGRAMD1B expression was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Functionally, circGRAMD1B acted as an anti-oncogene and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of GC cells. Then, we verified that circGRAMD1B served as a sponge that targeted miR-130a-3p in GC cells; circGRAMD1B alleviated GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting miR-130a-3p. A mechanistic analysis showed that PTEN and p21 were involved in circGRAMD1B/miR-130a-3p axis-inhibited GC tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that circGRAMD1B plays an important role in GC progression by regulating miR-130a-3p-PTEN/p21, which may provide a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.</AbstractText>"}

It is known that vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and in osteosarcoma. Moreover, VEGF-A expression correlates with clinical stages of osteosarcoma. The adipokine resistin exhibits proinflammatory, proangiogenic and metastatic properties, and evidence suggests that resistin may serve as a prognostic biomarker linking obesity and inflammation to cancer. However, whether resistin has a role in osteosarcoma angiogenesis is unclear. This investigation shows that resistin promotes VEGF-A expression in human osteosarcoma cells and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathways, while ERK, JNK, and p38 inhibitors or their small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibit resistin-induced VEGF-A expression as well as endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) migration and tube formation. We also found that resistin upregulates VEGF-A expression by enhancing activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Finally, resistin promotes angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Resistin appears to be a promising target for human osteosarcoma.</AbstractText>"}

However, whether TGF-β and LPS have a common downstream reactor remains unclear. Recently, a strong relationship of circular RNAs (circRNAs) and fibrogenesis has been elucidated. In this study, we compared the expressions of several circRNAs in TGF-β- and LPS-activated HSCs, and found that circ-PWWP2A was upregulated in both TGF-β- and LPS-activated HSCs and in mouse fibrotic liver tissues. Meanwhile, circ-PWWP2A was positively correlated with HSC activation and proliferation. Two microRNAs, miR-203 and miR-223, were identified to be the downstream targets of circ-PWWP2A using luciferase reporter assay and pull-down interaction assay. Circ-PWWP2A was suggested to promote HSC activation and proliferation via sponging miR-203 and miR-223, and subsequently increasing Fstl1 and TLR4, respectively. Furthermore, downregulating circ-PWWP2A was indicated to alleviate hepatic fibrosis in vivo. In conclusion, our findings indicated that circ-PWWP2A is the common downstream reactor of TGF-β and LPS in HSC activation, and that circ-PWWP2A plays a critical role in hepatic fibrogenesis via sponging miR-203 and miR-223.</AbstractText>"}

Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T cells (CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) as a signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of 2 supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15 to 35% of the entire CD4 T cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Indeed, CD4 CTLs extracted from supercentenarians produced IFN-γ and TNF-α upon ex vivo stimulation. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Temporal processing deficits have also been shown in single-unit studies at the level of the auditory brainstem, midbrain, and cortex of aged animals. In this study, we explored whether temporal coding is already affected at the level of the input to the central auditory system.Single-unit auditory nerve fiber recordings were obtained from 41 Mongolian gerbils of either sex, divided between young, middle-aged, and old gerbils. Temporal coding quality was evaluated as vector strength in response to tones at best frequency, and by constructing shuffled and cross-stimulus autocorrelograms, and reverse correlations, from responses to 1-s noise bursts at 10 - 30 dB sensation level (dB above threshold).At comparable sensation levels, all measures showed that temporal coding was not altered in auditory nerve fibers of aging gerbils. Furthermore, both temporal fine structure and envelope coding remained unaffected. However, spontaneous rates were decreased in aging gerbils. Importantly, despite elevated pure tone thresholds, the frequency tuning of auditory nerve fibers was not affected.These results suggest that age-related temporal coding deficits arise more centrally, possibly due to a loss of auditory nerve fibers (or their peripheral synapses) but not due to qualitative changes in the responses of remaining auditory nerve fibers. The reduced spontaneous rate and elevated thresholds, but normal frequency tuning, of aged auditory nerve fibers can be explained by the well-known reduction of endocochlear potential due to strial dysfunction in aged gerbils.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>As our society ages, age-related hearing deficits become ever more prevalent. Apart from decreased hearing sensitivity, elderly people often suffer from a reduced ability to communicate in daily settings, which is thought to be caused by known age-related deficits in auditory temporal processing. The current study demonstrated, using several different stimuli and analysis techniques, that these putative temporal processing deficits are not apparent in responses of single-unit auditory nerve fibers of quiet-aged gerbils. This suggests that age-related temporal processing deficits may develop more central to the auditory nerve, possibly due to a reduced population of active auditory nerve fibers, which will be of importance for the development of treatments for age-related hearing disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

WMH severity was quantified using the age-related white matter changes scale. Stepwise regressions, moderation, and mediation modeling were performed. Our findings show that Aβ deposition single-handedly predicts poorer episodic memory performance and that Aβ and WMHs contribute additively to poorer performance in working memory and language while carrying synergistic associations with executive functions and attention. Through mediation modeling, we demonstrated that the influence of age over episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, and language is fully mediated by brain pathology.

Increasing evidence also provides strong support for the involvement of the MDN in fluid intelligence (gF), that is, the ability to solve new problems. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of declining intelligence in old age are poorly explored, particularly whether maintenance of the functional architecture of the MDN can characterize superior intelligence in successful aging. Here, we used eigenvector centrality (EC) to explore the resting-state functional architecture of the MDN in terms of its communication across the entire brain. We found gF to be negatively associated with age and that the MDN EC competitively mediated age-related decline in gF over the aging lifespan, suggesting that excessive cross-talk from the MDN is deleterious for intelligence. Critically, older individuals with comparable MDN EC as younger individuals exhibited superior gF compared with their age-matched counterparts. Taken together, these data provide support for the maintenance of youth-like functional architecture of the MDN and its implication for superior intelligence in successful aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate that Regucalcin and Survivin, molecules which are known to be involved in the process of aging and overcoming aging, are epigenetically modified in NSCLC tissues compared to corresponding tumor-free tissues from the same donors by using methylome bead chip and corresponding transcriptome analyses. A high expression of Survivin on the RNA level was negatively correlated with patients' survival in adenocarcinomas while a high Regucalcin expression was correlated positively. In stage 1 adenocarcinomas, this separation is even sharper for both genes. Within these, adenocarcinomas, smokers with low expression of Survivin show a better outcome, while the high expression of Regucalcin seems to be protective in never smokers. On the protein level, these molecules were detected by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. Since Survivin can be secreted and we observed a high abundance of the protein also in the adjacent immune cells of the tumor microenvironment, an effect on benign cells can be assumed. These findings show that epigenetic re-programming of Survivin and Regucalcin in non-small cell lung cancer leads to enhanced expression of Survivin and reduced expression of Regucalcin, with a possible role of both molecules as predictive markers.</AbstractText>"}

As almost half of cancers are diagnosed after the age of 65, and considering the aging European population, a tidal wave of cancer cases will sweep across Europe within the coming decades. Without major action, the additional number of annual cancer cases is expected to rise from 4.2 million to 5.2 million by 2040. If we are to reach plateauing numbers by 2040 (as a minimum goal), this would require 0.75% annual reduction in risk and 1% reduction in risk of death. These challenges call for attack from various angles, coordinated efforts, rational strategies, initiatives throughout the cancer trajectory, activities to reduce inequities, and implementation of evidence-based measures. In order to defeat the societal challenges of cancer through innovation, Europe will need to join forces and connect the European Commission and the member states, politicians and citizens, industries and patient associations. A cancer mission should thus unite the public and patient viewpoint to the perspective of cancer professionals. The authors describe a plan that has been agreed upon among some of the major European Cancer organizations and associations. This plan uses a cancer mission as a tool and must deliver robust medical evidence to patients and doctors through high-quality research delivering sustainable and affordable strategies for prevention, treatment, and follow-up.</AbstractText>"}

This study conducted interviews using a questionnaire with a sample size of 326 participants in the cities of Hong Kong (China) and Tainan (Taiwan region). The inter-relationships among the design of UGSs (e.g., spatial distribution and accessibility, characteristics of plants and UGSs), older adults' perceptions on safety and aesthetics quality of UGSs, and their self-reported health conditions (assessed by the self-reported SF-12v2 Health Survey) were investigated with bivariate Spearman rank correlation tests. The results indicate that the duration of visits to UGSs was positively associated with mental health and social functioning, two subscales evaluating health-related quality of life in SF 12v2. The statistical model (moderation analysis) showed that such a correlation was especially significant in women and those with low social support and social capital. A positive relationship was found between the physical health subscale and perceived safety in UGSs. This relationship was stronger among older adults living alone (moderation analysis). Furthermore, the color of plants and maintenance condition of UGSs were significant aspects affecting the subjective assessment of aesthetic quality. This study provides useful information regarding how to plan and design urban green spaces with certain characteristics that could improve the accessibility and aesthetic quality, which are preferred by older adults.</AbstractText>"}

These operate on battery energy, according to the characteristics of the environment in which they are deployed. To enhance the longevity of IoT networks, the devices need to avoid any unnecessary sensing operations in order to reduce the power consumption rate. However, as existing sensing methods use a fixed sensing period policy, battery power wastage is inevitable. In this paper, a smart sensing period policy is proposed for efficient energy consumption in an IoT network. The proposed method uses a learning model based on a back-propagation neural network. Within the target time, it can efficiently use the battery energy without any surplus or wastage in the quantity of preserved battery energy. In experiments, our proposed method shows improved results in battery energy consumption rates compared to the existing sensing period methods.</AbstractText>"}

While natural leaf senescence is primarily associated with aging, it can also be induced by environmental and nutritional inputs including biotic and abiotic stresses, darkness, phytohormones and oxidants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a common thread in stress-dependent cell death and also increase during leaf senescence. Involvement of chloroplast redox chemistry (including ROS propagation) in modulating cell death is well supported, with photosynthesis playing a crucial role in providing redox-based signals to this process. While chloroplast contribution to senescence received less attention, recent findings indicate that changes in the redox poise of these organelles strongly affect senescence timing and progress. In this review, the involvement of chloroplasts in leaf senescence execution is critically assessed in relation to available evidence and the role played by environmental and developmental cues such as stress and phytohormones. The collected results indicate that chloroplasts could cooperate with other redox sources (e.g., mitochondria) and signaling molecules to initiate the committed steps of leaf senescence for a best use of the recycled nutrients in plant reproduction.</AbstractText>"}

As acoustophoresis allows for simultaneous washing and size-dependent separation in continuous flow mode, we efficiently obtained gram-negative bacteria that showed high affinity without any additional washing steps. The proposed device has a simple and efficient channel design, utilizing a long, square-shaped microchannel that shows excellent separation performance in terms of the purity, recovery, and concentration factor. Microbeads (10 µm) coated with the GN6 aptamer can specifically bind gram-negative bacteria. After incubation of bacteria culture sample with aptamer affinity bead, gram-negative bacteria-bound microbeads, and other unbound/contaminants can be separated by size with high purity and recovery. The device demonstrated excellent separation performance, with high recovery (up to 98%), high purity (up to 99%), and a high-volume rate (500 µL/min). The acoustophoretic separation performances were conducted using 5 Gram-negative bacteria and 5 Gram-positive bacteria. Thanks to GN6 aptamer's binding affinity, aptamer affinity bead also showed binding affinity to multiple strains of gram-negative bacteria, but not to gram-positive bacteria. GN6 coated bead can capture Gram-negative bacteria but not Gram-positive bacteria. This study may present a different perspective in the field of early diagnosis in bacterial infectious diseases. In addition to detecting living bacteria or bacteria-derived biomarkers, this protocol can be extended to monitoring the contamination of water resources and may aid quick responses to bioterrorism and pathogenic bacterial infections.</AbstractText>"}

Hemochorial placentation requires fast and reliable hemostasis to guarantee survival of the mother, but also for the neonates. During human pregnancy, maternal platelet count decreases gradually from first, to second, and third trimester. In addition to hemodilution, accelerated platelet sequestration and consumption in the placental circulation may contribute to a decline of platelet count throughout gestation. Local stasis, turbulences, or damage of the syncytiotrophoblast layer can activate maternal platelets within the placental intervillous space and result in formation of fibrin-type fibrinoid. Perivillous fibrinoid is a regular constituent of the normal placenta which is considered to be an important regulator of intervillous hemodynamics, as well as having a role in shaping the developing villous trees. However, exaggerated activation of platelets at the maternal-fetal interface can provoke inflammasome activation in the placental trophoblast, and enhance formation of circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates, resulting in sterile inflammation of the placenta and a systemic inflammatory response in the mother. Hence, the degree of activation determines whether maternal platelets are a friend or foe of the human placenta. Exaggerated activation of maternal platelets can either directly cause or propagate the disease process in placenta-associated pregnancy pathologies, such as preeclampsia.</AbstractText>"}

AD is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, but the mechanisms of cell death at different stages of the disease remain unknown. Here, by means of OXYS rats as an appropriate model of the most common (sporadic) AD form, we studied the main pathways of cell death during development of AD-like pathology, including the preclinical stage. We found that apoptosis is activated at the pre-symptomatic stage (age 20 days) correlating with the retardation of brain development in the OXYS strain early in life. Progression of the AD-like pathology was accompanied by activation of apoptosis and necroptosis resulting from a decline of autophagy-mediated proteostasis. Our results are consistent with the idea that the nature of changes in the pathways of apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis depends on the stage of AD.</AbstractText>"}

However, studies specific to maximal aerobic testing of surfers are scarce. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to compare two commercially available swim bench (SWB) ergometers in the determination of maximal aerobic capacity in recreational surfers. A secondary aim was to correlate (independent of one another) the two ergometer findings of VO<sub>2peak</sub> to the time taken to complete a water-based 400-m paddle test. This cross-sectional study consisted of 17 recreational surfers aged between 18-58 years. Participants were randomized to either the SwimFast ergometer or VASA ergometer and tested for maximal aerobic capacity, followed by a 400-m paddle test. There were no significant differences between the two SWB ergometers in the determination of relative VO<sub>2peak</sub> (mean difference 0.33 mL/kg/min; 95% CI -1.24-1.90; <i>p</i> = 0.66). Correlations between VO<sub>2peak</sub> obtained from maximal paddling effort on the SwimFast and the VASA and the 400-m paddle test (total time (s)) showed a negative significant correlation <i>r</i> = -0.819, <i>p</i> = 0.024; <i>r</i> = -0.818, <i>p</i> = 0.024, respectively. Results suggest that either ergometer (SwimFast or VASA) can be used to determine peak aerobic capacity within a recreational surfing cohort. The significant correlation of the two SWB ergometers and the 400-m paddle test suggest that the 400-m paddle test may be a suitable field-based method of determining aerobic capability. Collectively, these preliminary findings provide initial evidence for similarities in VO<sub>2peak</sub> on two commercial ergometers and their correlations with a field-based test.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis on the plasma-treated polyester wipes demonstrates the incorporation of reactive oxygen species on the fiber surface. Laser scanning microscopy demonstrates the plasma etching effect in smoothing the surface of the cotton wipe reducing the adsorption of ADBAC. The result showed no significant changes in breaking force and elongation during storage for W1 and W2.

Companion animals, especially dogs, are valuable species for overcoming many of these barriers, as dogs develop spontaneous tumors in the setting of an intact immune system, and the genetic and epigenetic factors that underlie oncogenesis appear to be similar between dogs and humans. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge for dog NK cells, including cell surface marker phenotype, key NK genes and genetic regulation, similarities and differences of dog NK cells to other mammals, especially human and mouse, expression of canonical inhibitory and activating receptors, ex vivo expansion techniques, and current and future clinical applications.

Shared common risk factors drive the development and worsening of poor oral health and non-communicable diseases, which eventually lead to self-care inability. Several studies have reported on the poor oral health of the institutionalized elderly population. However, few comprehensive reports exist regarding the relationship between poor oral health, the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and the associated factors in this specific population. <i>Objective:</i> The objective is to describe recently reported oral health levels, the OHRQoL and the associated factors among older institutional residents. <i>Methods:</i> Studies published between July 2009 and June 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched. The population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) strategy was used as a guide. The reported factors related to poor oral health were identified (i.e., age, gender, educational level, acquired systemic conditions or dementia/cognitive impairment). <i>Results:</i> Twenty-five surveys (or study series) from 19 countries were included. The level of evidence reported by these studies was generally moderate to strong. The reported oral cleanliness and health of the surveyed institutionalized elderly were poor (&gt;50% of residents had calculus; denture hygiene index &gt; 80%). Gum (approximately 30% of dentate residents had moderate to severe periodontitis), teeth (decayed, missing or filled teeth &gt;20), mucosa (&gt;10% had mucosal lesions) and denture problems (up to 40%) were prevalent and were associated with a poor OHRQoL, especially in females, socially deprived residents or those with mild or above cognitive impairment. Those with a poor OHRQoL might show signs of poor nutrition. <i>Conclusions:</i> This report reviewed evidence-based knowledge on oral health, the OHRQoL and the associated factors among elderly institutional residents. Further research is needed to confirm these observations. For improved oral health, a better OHRQoL and the general well-being of older residents, clinical trials are needed, targeting modifiable factors, such as social inequality, oral healthcare accessibility, and/or nursing home service quality. The relationship between oral health, the OHRQoL and nutrition in this at-risk population also warrants exploration.</AbstractText>"}

Exposure in riverine populations is responsible for neurobehavioral abnormalities. It was hypothesized that consumption of Amazonian fruits could protect by reducing mercury accumulation. This work analyzed the effects of commercial samples of <i>Euterpe oleracea</i> (EO) for human consumption (10 μL/g) against MeHg i.p. exposure (2.5 mg/Kg), using neurobehavioral (open field, rotarod and pole tests), biochemical (lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels), aging-related (telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA expression) and toxicokinetic (MeHg content) parameters in mice. Both the pole and rotarod tests were the most sensitive tests accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels in brains. MeHg reduced TERT mRNA about 50% demonstrating a strong pro-aging effect. The EO intake, similar to that of human populations, prevented all alterations, without changing the mercury content, but avoiding neurotoxicity and premature aging of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Contrary to the hypothesis found in the literature on the possible chelating properties of Amazonian fruits consumption, the effect of EO would be essentially pharmacodynamics, and possible mechanisms are discussed. Our data already support the regular consumption of EO as an excellent option for exposed Amazonian populations to have additional protection against MeHg intoxication.</AbstractText>"}

Exposure to multiple stressors can affect organisms in ways that are different than the sum of their individual effects, and these interactions are often difficult to predict. Atrazine and paraquat are two of the most widely used herbicides in the United States, and are individually known to increase oxidative damage, affect dopaminergic functioning, reduce longevity, and alter motor ability in non-target organisms. We measured the effects of individual and combined exposure to low doses of atrazine and paraquat on climbing ability and longevity of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Atrazine and paraquat interact to affect <i>D. melanogaster</i> climbing ability and longevity in different ways. Atrazine appeared to have a weak mitigative effect against the decrease in climbing ability caused by paraquat.

The aim of this study was to investigate differential characteristics between older adults with and without MCI. The investigation was conducted over one year from 2018 to 2019. Participants were recruited from Akita in northern Japan. Neuropsychological assessments were applied to classify MCI, including the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Functional Assessment Tool (NCGG-FAT) and the Touch panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) based on the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale. Our samples consisted of 103 older adults divided into 54 non-MCI and 49 MCI. The MCI group had lower scores of all cognitive items. Our results showed that individuals with MCI had significantly slower walking speed (WS) and worse geriatric depression scale (GDS) compared to non-MCI. In addition, WS was significantly associated with some cognitive items in non-MCI, but not in MCI. Finally, we showed that predictive variables of MCI were WS and GDS. Our study provides important information about MCI in rural community-dwellers. We suggest that older adults living in a super-aging society should receive lower limb training, and avoiding depression in older adults through interaction of community-dwellers may contribute to preventing the onset of MCI.</AbstractText>"}

To evaluate the corrosion properties, potentiodynamic tests were conducted and a galvanostatic test was used to accelerate corrosion. Tensile tests and microstructure observations were performed to figure out the degradation of the corroded region, and stress intensity factors were calculated. As a result of the potentiodynamic tests, welded carbon steel pipe showed uniform corrosion and the total charge was calculated. Using the galvanostatic test, the current density at the equivalent aging time was applied to the specimens. The tensile tests showed that according to corrosion damages, mechanical properties were degraded due to corrosion. Through the microstructure observations and calculations of stress intensity factors, the corrosion of the welded carbon steel pipe induced the degradation of mechanical properties. The mode of fracture was changed from ductile to brittle fracture with increasing aging time.</AbstractText>"}

The incidence of allergic reactions is also rising worldwide. Until recently, allergies, and in particular food allergies (FAs), was regarded as a pediatric problem, since some of them start in early childhood and may spontaneously disappear in adulthood. It is being discovered that, on the contrary, these problems are increasingly affecting even the elderly. Along with other diseases that are considered characteristics of advanced age, such as cardiovascular, dysmetabolic, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and oncological diseases, even FAs are increasingly frequent in the elderly. An FA is a pleiomorphic and multifactorial disease, characterized by an abnormal immune response and an impaired gut barrier function. The elderly exhibit distinct FA phenotypes, and diagnosis is difficult due to frequent co-morbidities and uncertainty in the interpretation of in vitro and in vivo tests. Several factors render the elderly susceptible to FAs, including the physiological changes of aging, a decline in gut barrier function, the skewing of adaptive immunity to a Th2 response, dysregulation of innate immune cells, and age-related changes of gut microbiota. Aging is accompanied by a progressive remodeling of immune system functions, leading to an increased pro-inflammatory status where type 1 cytokines are quantitatively dominant. However, serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and T helper type 2 (Th2 cytokine production have also been found to be increased in the elderly, suggesting that the type 2 cytokine pattern is not necessarily defective in older age. Dysfunctional dendritic cells in the gut, defects in secretory IgA, and decreased T regulatory function in the elderly also play important roles in FA development. We address herein the main immunologic aspects of aging according to the presence of FAs.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study was to determine the dose-dependent effect of a CFO against bone loss in C57BL/6 female mice during aging. Twelve-month old mice were fed with 1% and 4% CFO and 4% safflower oil (SFO) diets, including a group with a 4% regular-FO diet and a group with a lab chow diet for 12 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after the dietary intervention. At the end of dietary intervention, bone resorption markers in serum and inflammatory markers in bone marrow and splenocytes and inflammatory signaling pathways in the bone marrow were analyzed. As compared to the 4% SFO control, 4% CFO maintained higher BMD during aging, while 1% CFO offered only a mild benefit. However, the 1% CFO fed group exhibited slightly better BMD than the 4% regular-FO fed group. BMD loss protection by CFO was accompanied by reduced levels of the bone resorption marker, TRAP, and the osteoclast-stimulating-factor, RANKL, without affecting the decoy-receptor of RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Further, CFO supplementation was associated with an increase in the production of IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-γ and a decrease in the production of TNF-α and IL-6, and the activation of NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways. In conclusion, the supplementation of 4% CFO is very efficient in maintaining BMD during aging, whereas 1% CFO is only mildly beneficial. CFO supplementation starting at middle age may maintain better bone health during aging.</AbstractText>"}

However, the mechanism of the anti-osteoporotic effect of FLL and its link to the gut microbiota remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that sustained exposure of ICR mice to D-galactose / sodium nitrite for 90 days causes aging-related osteoporosis and reduced cognitive performance. The aging phenotype is also characterized by increased oxidative stress in serum. This is likely triggered by abnormal changes in the gut microbiota population of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and the ratio of <i>Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes</i> that resulted in increased levels of flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Moreover, the increased oxidative stress further accelerated aging by increasing tumor necrosis factor-α levels in serum and reducing Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) expression in long bones, which prompted nuclear factor kappa-B acetylation as well as over-expression and activation of cathepsin K. FLL-treated aging mice revealed a non-osteoporotic bone phenotype and an improvement on the cognitive function. The mechanism underlying these effects may be linked to the regulation of gut microbiota diversity, antioxidant activity, and the levels of TMAO and Sirt6. FLL may represent a potential source for identifying anti-senile osteoporotic drug candidates.</AbstractText>"}

Unfortunately, despite the use of evidence-based therapies, patients with ASCVD continue to have recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, and stroke-at a rate of approximately 2%-4% per year. To combat this continuing risk, several recent trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of more intensive antithrombotic strategies through prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), combining a P2Y12 receptor antagonists and low-dose aspirin, or alternatively applying a dual pathway inhibition approach, combining low-dose non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant and low-dose aspirin. Both combination strategies have been shown to reduce recurrent ischemic events but at the cost of increased bleeding events. The clinical application of these antithrombotic strategies requires clinicians to assess and balance the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in an individual patient. Furthermore, clinicians may also need to adapt their antithrombotic strategies to achieve best patient outcomes, as ASCVD is a progressive disease and the risks of cardiovascular ischemic and bleeding events may shift over time. This state-of-the-art article reviews evidence from the trials and provides a practical approach to the application of DAPT and dual pathway antithrombotic therapy in the long-term management of patients with chronic ASCVD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The onset of HD has been linked to a pathogenic CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes for the polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. Notably, the neuropathogenic events of the mutant HTT gene appear to be primed during adulthood and magnified along the ageing process. While the normal Htt protein is vital for the neuronal differentiation and neuroprotection, experimental HD models and postmortem human HD brains have been characterized by neurodegeneration and defects in neuroregenerative plasticity in the basal ganglia and limbic system including the hippocampus. Besides gonadal dysfunctions, reduced androgen levels and abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis have increasingly been evident in HD. Recently, ageing-related changes in levels of steroid sex hormones have been proposed to play a detrimental effect on the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain. Considering its adult-onset nature, a potential relationship between dysregulation in the synthesis of sex steroid hormones and the pathogenesis of the mutant HTT gene appears to be an important clinical issue in HD. While the hippocampus and testis are the major sites of steroidogenesis, the presence of Htt in both areas is conclusively evident. Hence, the expression of the normal HTT gene may take part in the steroidogenic events in aforementioned organs in the physiological state, whereas the mutant HTT gene may cause defects in steroidogenesis in HD. Therefore, this review article comprehends the potential relationship between the gonadal dysfunctions and abnormal hippocampal plasticity in HD and represents a hypothesis for the putative role of the HTT gene in the regulation of steroidogenesis in gonads and in the brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of diphlorethohydroxycarmalol (DPHC), isolated from the marine brown alga, Ishige okamurae, against UVB-induced photodamage using both in vitro and in vivo models. Results indicate that DPHC remarkably inhibited commercial collagenase and elastase activities. It also reduced intracellular levels of ROS, improved cell viability and collagen content in UVB-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (HDF cells). In addition, DPHC significantly inhibited activities of intracellular collagenase and elastase and reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These events occurred through regulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways in UVB-irradiated HDF cells. Furthermore, DPHC also protected against in vivo photodamage by decreasing cell death through reducing lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response via decreasing ROS levels in UVB-irradiated zebrafish.

Microglia affect the function of other glial cells and neurons, including those involved in the hypothalamic control of body homeostasis. Microglial dysfunction with aging in cognitive areas such as the hippocampus is known to associate with cognitive decline; more recently, microglial alterations in the hypothalamus during midlife was suggested to participate in changes in the endocrine and metabolic control exerted by this brain region. Consequently, the feed-back loops between endocrine glands and the hypothalamus are altered. This generates a vicious circle in which the plasma levels of key neuroprotective hormones, such as gonadal hormones, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone and leptin and their hypothalamic signaling are decreased, which further enhances microglial alterations and deterioration of hypothalamic function. Hypothalamic dysfunction is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and these diseases in turn promote additional alterations in hypothalamic microglial cells, which are unable to cope with the neurodegenerative process, resulting in permanent damage of the neuronal-glial circuits controlling endocrine homeostasis, food intake and body metabolism. Thus, a 'vicious cycle' may such be initiated.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Also well documented is the age related decline of the neurohormone, melatonin, in both humans and nonhuman animals. What has not been well studied is the possible interaction between the D2 receptor system and the age related decline in melatonin with its unmistakable pattern of synthesis and release exclusively during the dark phase. We tested the effect of the D2 antagonist, haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg ip), in adolescent (2 mo old) and adult rats (10 mo old) in the light (ZT3) and dark phases (ZT 15) in rats kept in a 12 L/12D cycle and the effect of exogenous melatonin (15 mg/kg ip/day x 4 days for a total of 60 mg/kg) on D2 antagonism. Using the bar test, measuring the extrapyramidal side-effect of hypokinesia, we report haloperidol to work differentially depending on both age and phase. Adult rats experienced the effect of the D2 antagonist in both the light and dark phases, while younger rats did not show hypokinetic affects in the dark. By manipulated lighting, we were able to restore the effect of haloperidol in younger rats in the dark phase. We also found ameliorating effects of melatonin lessening time on the bar after treatment with haloperidol, however, this effect was only found in older rats. These data demonstrate the importance of the light/dark cycle and age in the susceptibility of extrapyramidal effects with use of drugs that target D2 receptor function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, whether this disturbance is due to dysfunctional visual information processing remains unclear. To clarify the effects of PD on visual information processing when exploring for targets and to compare disease effects with aging effects, we used an infrared eye-movement assessment system. Cognitively normal PD patients (n = 13), healthy age-matched (n = 17) and young controls (n = 36) participated in this study, and were evaluated using two figure-matching tasks representing visual information processing (clock-matching and inverted clock-matching tasks) and saccade tasks representing oculomotor function. With figure-matching tasks, PD patients showed significantly larger numbers of images watched in a single trial compared to healthy age-matched controls on the inverted clock-matching task. No aging effects was found in these variables. In contrast, no disease effect was apparent for reaction time, which was significantly longer in healthy age-matched controls than in healthy young controls. For saccade tasks, PD patients showed significantly smaller saccade size than healthy age-matched controls on the antisaccade task, but no aging effects were evident. Our approaches highlighted that visual exploration disturbance in PD may be due to dysfunctional visual information processing in addition to dysfunctional oculomotor processing. These disease effects may differ from aging effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

While iPSCs are a valuable tool for modeling developmental and monogenetic disorders, their rejuvenated identity poses limitations for modeling age-associated diseases. Direct cell-type conversion of fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) circumvents rejuvenation and preserves hallmarks of cellular aging. iNs are thus advantageous for modeling diseases that possess strong age-related and epigenetic contributions and can complement iPSC-based strategies for disease modeling. In this review, we provide an overview of the state of the art of direct iN conversion and describe the key epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic changes that occur in converting fibroblasts. Furthermore, we summarize new insights into this fascinating process, particularly focusing on the rapidly changing criteria used to define and characterize in vitro-born human neurons.

We previously showed that pink1 and parkin, two familial PD genes, function in a linear pathway to maintain mitochondrial integrity and function. Studies of mammalian cell lines also suggest that these genes regulate mitochondrial autophagy(mitophagy). Overexpressing Parkin promotes proteostasis and function of aged muscles both in fruit flies and mice, and recent studies also indicated that mitochondrial ubiquitination are accumulated in aged muscles. However, the underlying mechanisms for pink1 and parkin mediated mitophagy on longevity is not fully understood. Here, we found that mitochondrial ubiquitination increased in indirect flight muscles (IFMs) in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of pink1 or parkin in IFMs can abolish mitochondrial ubiquitination, restore ATP level and extend lifespan, while blocking autophagy via ATG1 knock-down suppress these effects in aged IFMs. Taken together, these results show that pink1/parkin promotes mitophagy of mitochondrial ubiquitination in aged muscles and extend lifespan in an Atg1-dependent manner. Our study provides physiological evidence that mitophagy of mitochondrial ubiquitination mediated by PINK1/ Parkin is crucial for muscle function and highlights the role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases like PD.</AbstractText>"}

Its activity toward tau is regulated by the methylation of PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) at Leu309. Protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1) demethylates PP2Ac and suppresses its activity. We previously found that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) suppresses PME-1 expression. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the promoter of <i>PME-1</i> gene and found that human <i>PME-1</i> promoter contains two <i>lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1/T-cell factor</i> (<i>LEF1/TCF</i>) <i>cis</i>-elements in which β-catenin serves as a co-activator. β-catenin acted on these two <i>cis</i>-elements and promoted PME-1 expression. GSK-3β phosphorylated β-catenin and suppressed its function in promoting PME-1 expression.

Then, ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are activated. Targeting ER stress may enhance the adaptive UPR and then protect the cell against pathogenic environments. In the present study, we utilized nanotechnology to synthesize thapsigargin nanoparticles (TG NPs) which induced ER stress and the UPR pathway, to study the role of ER stress and autophagy in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We found that the mRNA levels of ER stress- and autophagy-related molecules were elevated in the renal tissue of CKD patients compared to those of healthy individuals. Furthermore, TG NPs induced the UPR pathway and autophagy in HK-2 human kidney tubular epithelial cells. TG NPs protected HK-2 cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death through the activation of Nrf2 and FoxO1. The siRNA-mediated inhibition of Nrf2 or FoxO1 resulted in enhanced oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in HK-2 cells. In a mouse model of adenine diet-induced CKD, TG NPs and KIM-1-TG NPs ameliorated renal injury through the stimulation of ER stress and its downstream pathways.

In particular, decreased proteostasis is a widespread molecular feature of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Familial AD is largely caused by mutations in the presenilin encoding genes; however, their role in AD is not understood. In this study, we investigate the role of presenilins in proteostasis using the model system Caenorhabditis elegans. Previously, we found that mutations in C. elegans presenilin cause elevated ER to mitochondria calcium signaling, which leads to an increase in mitochondrial generated oxidative stress. This, in turn, promotes neurodegeneration. To understand the cellular mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, using several molecular readouts of protein stability in C. elegans, we find that presenilin mutants have widespread defects in proteostasis. Markedly, we demonstrate that these defects are independent of the protease activity of presenilin and that reduction in ER to mitochondrial calcium signaling can significantly prevent the proteostasis defects observed in presenilin mutants. Furthermore, we show that supplementing presenilin mutants with antioxidants suppresses the proteostasis defects. Our findings indicate that defective ER to mitochondria calcium signaling promotes proteostatic collapse in presenilin mutants by increasing oxidative stress.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

It has been specially found useful in neurodegenerative diseases and recent evidence points to the positive effects of meditation in preserving grey and white matter in the adult brain. It is also a potential therapy to downregulate processes implicated in brain aging and confer 'neuroprotection'- something we all look forward to for our glaucoma patients. In the current review, we evaluate the benefits of meditation practice for the glaucoma patient and support for its candidature as adjunctive therapy for glaucoma patients. It has multiple potential benefits for normal as well as high pressure glaucoma patients including a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP), increasing cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, and decreasing action of the sympathetic nervous system with a corresponding increase in parasympathetic nervous system activity. Meditation leads to a 'relaxation response' mediated by nitric oxide with decrease in the stress hormone cortisol, increase in neurotrophins and mitochondrial energy production and improves the overall quality of life of glaucoma patients. It can also benefit caregivers of glaucoma patients and health care providers. It appears that meditation can function as a multifaceted management approach for glaucoma using the natural potential of the human body and target not only the eye but the patient behind the eye to ameliorate this 'sick eye in a sick body' condition.</AbstractText>"}

This breakdown in mitotic fidelity results from the age-related activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and the resulting degradation of histone proteins. Disrupting the ability of cells to degrade histones in response to DNA damage increases replicative lifespan and reduces genomic missegregations.

Outcomes were days to death from all causes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and causes other than circulatory diseases, cancer, accidents/homicide/suicides, or injuries (other causes). Measures in 1958 included age, education, health behaviors, biomedical risk factors, and nine content factors identified in the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Four content factors-neuroticism, cynicism, extraversion, and intellectual interests-were related to the five-factor model domains of neuroticism, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness, respectively. The remaining five-psychoticism, masculinity versus femininity, religious orthodoxy, somatic complaints, and inadequacy-corresponded to the five-factor model's facets and styles (combinations of two domains) or were unrelated to the five-factor model. In age-adjusted and fully adjusted models, cynicism was associated with greater all-cause and cancer mortality. In fully adjusted models, inadequacy was associated with lower all-cause mortality and lower mortality from other causes. In age-adjusted models, religious orthodoxy was associated with lower cancer mortality. Further analyses revealed that the association between cynicism and all-cause mortality waned over time. Exploratory analyses of death from any disease of the circulatory system revealed no further associations. These findings reveal the importance of cynicism (disagreeableness) as a mortality risk factor, show that associations between cynicism and all-cause mortality are limited to certain periods of the lifespan, and highlight the need to study personality styles or types, such as inadequacy, that involve high neuroticism, low extraversion, and low conscientiousness.

Their high surface area and water content provide a unique reaction environment for multiphase chemistry that continually modifies particle composition and properties that consequently impact air quality as well as concentrations of gas-phase species. By absorbing and scattering solar and terrestrial radiation, particles directly influence the planet's radiative balance. Their indirect effects include modifying the nucleation, lifetime, and physical properties of clouds. Due to the sensitivity of the atmospheric environment to all these variables, fundamental studies of chemical transformations of atmospheric particles, their sources, continuously evolving composition, and physical properties are of highest research priority. Accurate descriptions of particles and their effects in the atmosphere require comprehensive information not only on the particle-type populations and their size distributions and concentrations, but also on the diversity and the spatial heterogeneity of chemical components within individual particles. Developments and applications of modern chemical imaging approaches for off-line characterization of atmospheric particles have been at the forefront of modern experimental studies and have resulted in a transformative impact in atmospheric chemistry and physics. This Account presents a synopsis of recent advances in chemical imaging of atmospheric particles collected on substrates during field and laboratory experiments. The unique advantage of chemical imaging methods is that they simultaneously provide two analytical measurements: imaging of particles to assess variability in their individual sizes and morphology, as well as particle-specific speciation of their composition and spatial heterogeneity of different chemical components within individual particles. We also highlight analytical chemistry approaches that enable chemical imaging of particles with different levels of elemental and molecular specificity, including applications of multimodal methodologies where the same or similar groups of particles are probed by two or more complementary techniques. These approaches provide unique experimental insights on the nature and sources of particles, understanding their physical properties, atmospheric reactivity, and transformations. Chemical imaging data provide unique experimental input for atmospheric models that simulate aging and changes in particle-type populations, internal composition, and their associated optical and cloud forming properties. We highlight applications of chemical imaging in selected recent studies, discuss their existing limitations, and forecast future research directions for this area.</AbstractText>"}

HGPS cells show morphological abnormalities of the nuclear membrane, reduced cell proliferation rates, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and expression of senescence markers. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a growth factor-like lipid mediator that regulates various physiological functions via activating multiple LPA G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we study the roles of LPA and LPA receptors in premature aging. We report that the protein level of LPA<sub>3</sub> was highly downregulated through internalization and the lysosomal degradation pathway in Progerin-transfected HEK293 cells. By treating Progerin HEK293 cells with an LPA<sub>3</sub> agonist (OMPT, 1-Oleoyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerophosphothionate) and performing shRNA knockdown of the Lpa3r transcript in these cells, we showed that LPA<sub>3</sub> activation increased expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, consequently inhibiting ROS accumulation and ameliorating cell senescence. LPA<sub>3</sub> was shown to be downregulated in HGPS patient fibroblasts through the lysosomal pathway, and it was shown to be crucial for ameliorating ROS accumulation and cell senescence in fibroblasts. Moreover, in a zebrafish model, LPA<sub>3</sub> deficiency was sufficient to cause premature aging phenotypes in multiple organs, as well as a shorter lifespan. Taken together, these findings identify the decline of LPA<sub>3</sub> as a key contributor to the premature aging phenotypes of HGPS cells and zebrafish.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Age-related changes of the pineal have been observed, including decreased pinealocyte numbers, increased calcification, and a reduction in melatonin production. Since fluoride is attracted to calcium within the pineal gland, this study sought to examine the effects of a fluoride-free diet on the morphology of the pineal gland of aged male rats (26 months old). All animals had previously been raised on standard fluoridated food and drinking water. These control animals were compared to other animals that were placed on a fluoride-free diet ('fluoride flush') for 4 or 8 weeks. At 4 weeks, pineal glands from fluoride-free animals showed a 96% increase in supporting cell numbers and at 8 weeks a 73% increase in the number of pinealocytes compared to control animals. In contrast, the number of pinealocytes and supporting cells in animals given an initial 4-week fluoride flush followed by a return to fluoridated drinking water (1.2 ppm NaF) for 4 weeks were not different from control animals. Our findings therefore demonstrate that a fluoride-free diet encouraged pinealocyte proliferation and pineal gland growth in aged animals and fluoride treatment inhibited gland growth.

To explain this, I suggest a parallel between brain ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and assume that theories concerning the brain's vulnerability to AD and its individual variability may also explain why some of the oldest old remain cognitively efficient. Some theories argue that AD is due to the continuing presence of the immature neurones vulnerable to amyloid beta protein (Aß) that are normally involved in brain development and then removed as a result of cell selection by the proteins associated with both brain development and AD. If a dysfunction in cell selection allows these immature neurones to survive, they degenerate early as a result of the neurotoxic action of Aß accumulation, which their mature counterparts can withstand. Consequently, age at the time of onset of AD and its clinical presentations depend on the number and location of such immature cells. I speculate that the same mechanism is responsible for the variability of normal brain ageing: the oldest old with well-preserved cognitive function are people genetically programmed for extreme ageing who have benefited from better cell selection during prenatal and neonatal life and therefore have fewer surviving neurones vulnerable to amyloid-promoted degeneration, whereas the process of early life cell selection was less successful in the oldest old who develop dementia.</AbstractText>"}

In this respect, DHEA could be regarded as a promising agent against metabolic syndrome (MetS) in postmenopausal women, since several age-related metabolic diseases are reported during aging. There are plenty of experimental evidences showing beneficial effects after DHEA therapy on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as cardiovascular health.

Changes in the stem cell niche, increased energy metabolic rate, and accumulation of cell damage severely affect the function and regenerative capacity of stem cells. Reducing the cellular damage and maintaining a pristine stem cell niche by regulating the energy metabolic pathways could be ideal for the proper functioning of stem cells and tissue homeostasis. Numerous studies point out that caloric restriction (CR) has beneficiary effects on stem cell maintenance and tissue regeneration. Recent researches indicate the preventive nature of calorie restriction in stem cells by modulating the stem cell niche through the reduction of energy metabolism and eventually decrease stem cell damage. In this review, we have focused on the general stimuli of stem cell aging, particularly the energy metabolism as an intrinsic influence and stem cell niche as an extrinsic influence in different adult stem cells. Further, we discussed the mechanism behind CR in different adult stem cells and their niche.

The proportion of individuals with OH increases with aging and chronic conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, renal dysfunction, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. In individuals over 70 years of age, more than 20% can be affected. It is now increasingly recognized that there is a direct relationship between OH and each step of the CV disease continuum, eventually leading to end‑stage heart disease and CV death. In particular, prevalent OH is associated with cardiac functional and structural remodeling, left ventricular hypertrophy, elevated levels of circulating markers of inflammation, increased intima‑media thickness, subclinical atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. Beyond subclinical changes, the presence of OH independently predicts coronary events, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and CV mortality. Furthermore, OH is associated with syncope, falls, and fragility fractures, presenting hurdles to be overcome in the delivery of the best management of CV risk factors. Taken together, OH heralds disruption of global circulatory homeostasis and flags overt autonomic dysfunction. The presence of OH is also an independent risk factor for mortality and CV disease; however, until now, the importance of this highly prevalent disorder has been given insufficient attention by clinicians and other healthcare providers. Consequently, more studies are needed to find effective treatment for this troublesome condition and to identify preventive measures that could reduce the burden of CV risk in OH and autonomic dysfunction.</AbstractText>"}

Relevance for Vaccination.","Journal":"Current pharmaceutical design","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Aging, TLR, cytokines, dendritic cells, immunosenescence, vaccination.","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Aging is characterized by a general decline in a range of physiological functions, with a consequent increase in the risk of developing a variety of chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes. Additionally, increasing age is accompanied by a progressive decline in both innate and acquired immune system, referred to as immunosenescence. This impaired ability to mount an efficient immune response after exposure to microorganisms or vaccines represents a major challenge in acquiring protection against pathogens in aging. Therefore, there is still a great need for vaccines that are tailored to optimally stimulate the aged immune system, thus promoting more successful aging. Various strategies can be used to improve vaccine efficacy in old people. Despite this, metaanalyses have clearly shown that the magnitude of protection obtained remains lower in older adults. Recent studies show that stimulation of Toll-like receptors, using stimulatory ligands, can enhance vaccine efficacy by a number of mechanisms, including the activation of innate immune cells and the consequent production of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, a possible strategy for more effective vaccination in the older population is the triggering of multiple TLRs, using a combined adjuvant for the synergistic activation of cellular immunity. Preliminary in vitro data suggest that in humans the presence of multiple TLR agonists can result in the greater stimulation of antigen-specific immune responses in immune cells both in the young healthy and in the immune senescent older donors. These data suggest that appropriately selected combinations of TLR agonists could enhance the efficacy of vaccination mediated immunity in older people.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim of this article is to propose a Two-Track Model of Dementia Grief (TTM-DG). This model enlarges the theoretical, research and clinical lenses for dementia, and explores how the illness process as well as the bereavement responses after death stimulate the reworking of grief and mourning over the beloved family member. Based on the insights derived from the Two-Track Model of Loss and Bereavement and the Continuing Bonds paradigm, we propose that the clinical and research examination of dementia grief begin in life and continue after the death. The TTM - DG's Track I focuses on bio-psycho-social functioning and Track II focuses on the internalized psychological representation of the patient, the ongoing relational bond and the illness and death story. A case study illustrates how this combined perspective provides a comprehensive picture of the experience of grief for persons afflicted with dementia over the course of the disease trajectory. Future clinical and empirical research has an important role to play in the further development of this model.</AbstractText>"}

Although it is known that both B and T lymphocyte compartments of the adaptive immune system deteriorate with advancing age, the impact of aging on immune functions of Th17-type CD161-expressing innate immune cells and their role in inflammaging remain incompletely understood. Here, utilizing the nonhuman primate model of rhesus macaques, we report that a dysregulated Th17-type effector function of CD161<sup>+</sup> immune cells is associated with leaky gut and inflammatory phenotype of aging. Higher plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12, and Eotaxin correlated with elevated markers of gut permeability including LPS-binding protein (LBP), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and sCD14 in aging macaques. Further, older macaques displayed significantly lower frequencies of circulating Th17-type immune cells comprised of CD161<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, NK cells, and innate lymphoid cells. Corresponding with the increased markers of gut permeability, production of the type-17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 was impaired in CD161<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets and NK cells, along with a skewing towards IFN-γ cytokine production. These findings suggest that reduced frequencies of CD161<sup>+</sup> immune cells along with a specific loss in Th17-type effector functions contribute to impaired gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammation in aging macaques. Modulating type-17 immune cell functions via cytokine therapy or dietary interventions towards reducing chronic inflammation in inflammaging individuals may have the potential to prevent or delay age-related chronic diseases and improve immune responses in the elderly population.</AbstractText>"}

During this process, age-related genetic and epigenetic mutations steadily accumulate. Cascading deleterious effects of mutations might initiate a steady 'accumulation of deficits' in cells, despite the existence of repair mechanisms, leading to cellular senescence and functional decline of tissues and organs, which ultimately manifest as frailty and disease. Here, we investigate several of these aspects in differentiating cell populations through modeling and simulation using the Moran birth-death (demographic) process, under several scenarios of mutation accumulation. Deleterious mutations seem to rapidly accumulate particularly early in the course of life, during which the rate of cell division is high, thereby exerting a greater effect on subsequent cellular senescence. Our results are compatible with the principle of the Muller's ratchet taking place in asexually reproducing organisms. The ratchet speed in a given tissue depends on the size of the cell population, mutation rate and the impact of such mutations on cell phenotypes. It varies substantially among cells in different tissues and organs due to heterogeneity in relation to cell and organ-specific demographic features. Ratchet accelerates particularly after middle age, resulting in a synergistic fitness decay at the level of cell populations. We extend Fisher's average excess concept and rank order scale to interpret differential phenotypic effects of the increase of the mutation load among cell populations within a given tissue. We postulate that classical evolutionary genetic models can explain, at least in part, the origins of frailty, subclinical conditions, morbidity and the health consequences of senescence.</AbstractText>"}

An increase in oxidative stress is one of the hallmarks of aging, and Nrf2 protein levels and activity decrease with aging. Decreased mitochondrial functions, such as decreased ATP production, also occur with aging, leading to the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Thus, understanding the relationships between Nrf2 and the mitochondria is important for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms of aging. It is becoming clear that Nrf2 is activated in a tissue-specific manner in response to mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-generated ROS. As the heart consists of postmitotic cells that utilize ATP produced mainly by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, cardiomyocytes are equipped with highly sophisticated mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. Consistent with these findings, it has been reported that Nrf2 in the heart is regulated via a specific translational mechanism and that Nrf2 activation confers cardioprotective effects in various disease models. Thus, Nrf2 is a promising target for anti-aging strategies to combat age-related heart diseases, such as age-related cardiomyopathy.</AbstractText>"}

Indoor emissions and chemistry can also have direct impacts on the quality of outdoor air. And so, it is important to have a strong fundamental knowledge of the chemical processes that occur in indoor environments. This review article summarizes our understanding of the indoor chemistry field. Using a molecular perspective, it addresses primarily the new advances that have occurred in the past decade or so and upon developments in our understanding of multiphase partitioning and reactions. A primary goal of the article is to contrast indoor chemistry to that which occurs outdoors, which we know to be a strongly gas-phase, oxidant-driven system in which substantial oxidative aging of gases and aerosol particles occurs. By contrast, indoor environments are dark, gas-phase oxidant concentrations are relatively low, and due to air exchange, only short times are available for reactive processing of gaseous and particle constituents. However, important gas-surface partitioning and reactive multiphase chemistry occur in the large surface reservoirs that prevail in all indoor environments. These interactions not only play a crucial role in controlling the composition of indoor surfaces but also the surrounding gases and aerosol particles, thus affecting human chemical exposure. There are rich research opportunities available if the advanced measurement and modeling tools of the outdoor atmospheric chemistry community continue to be brought indoors.</AbstractText>"}

In Pavlovian conditioning models, where cues predict reinforcer delivery at a different goal location, some animals-called sign-trackers-come to approach the cue, whereas others, called goal-trackers, approach the goal. In sign-trackers, model-free phasic dopaminergic reward-prediction errors underlie learning, which renders stimuli 'wanted'. Goal-trackers do not rely on dopamine for learning and are thought to use model-based learning. We demonstrate this double dissociation in 129 male humans using eye-tracking, pupillometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging informed by computational models of sign- and goal-tracking. We show that sign-trackers exhibit a neural reward prediction error signal that is not detectable in goal-trackers. Model-free value only guides gaze and pupil dilation in sign-trackers. Goal-trackers instead exhibit a stronger model-based neural state prediction error signal. This model-based construct determines gaze and pupil dilation more in goal-trackers.</AbstractText>"}

We analysed data from 5765 men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with both pericardial fat volume and plasma FGF21 levels measured at baseline. 4746 participants had pericardial fat volume measured in at least one follow-up exam. After adjusting for confounding factors, ln-transformed FGF21 levels were positively associated with pericardial fat volume at baseline (β = 0.055, p &lt; 0.001). When assessing change in pericardial fat volume over a mean duration of 3.0 years using a linear mixed-effects model, higher baseline FGF21 levels were associated with higher pericardial fat volume at baseline (2.381 cm<sup>3</sup> larger in pericardial fat volume per one SD increase in ln-transformed FGF21 levels), but less pericardial fat accumulation over time (0.191 cm<sup>3</sup>/year lower per one SD increase in ln-transformed FGF21 levels). Cross-sectionally, higher plasma FGF21 levels were significantly associated with higher pericardial fat volume, independent of traditional CVD risk factors and inflammatory markers. However, higher FGF21 levels tended to be associated with less pericardial fat accumulation over time. Nevertheless, such change in pericardial fat volume is very modest and could be due to measurement error. Further studies are needed to elucidate the longitudinal relationship of baseline FGF21 levels with pericardial fat accumulation.</AbstractText>"}

Amphetamine increases synaptic striatal dopamine levels and can induce positive psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia. Socio-developmental hypotheses of psychosis propose that childhood trauma and other environmental risk factors sensitize the dopamine system to increase the risk of psychotic symptoms, but this remains to be tested in humans. We used [<sup>11</sup>C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography to measure striatal dopamine-2/3 receptor (D<sub>2/3</sub>R) availability and ventral striatal dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release in healthy participants (n = 24). The relationships between dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release, dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and childhood trauma using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were assessed using linear regression and mediation analyses, with childhood trauma as the independent variable, dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release as the mediator variable, and dexamphetamine-induced symptoms as the dependent variable. There was a significant interaction between childhood trauma and ventral striatal dopamine release in predicting dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms (standardized β = 1.83, p = 0.003), but a mediation analysis was not significant (standardized β = -0.18, p = 0.158). There were no significant effects of dopamine release and childhood trauma on change in negative (p = 0.280) or general PANSS symptoms (p = 0.061), and there was no relationship between ventral striatal baseline D<sub>2/3</sub>R availability and positive symptoms (p = 0.368). This indicates childhood trauma and dopamine release interact to influence the induction of positive psychotic symptoms. This is not consistent with a simple sensitization hypothesis, but suggests that childhood trauma moderates the cognitive response to dopamine release to make psychotic experiences more likely.</AbstractText>"}

At current, works in major depressive disorder have predominantly focused on neuroimaging and clinical predictor modalities, with genetic, blood-biomarker, and cardiovascular modalities lacking. In addition, the prediction of rehospitalization after an initial inpatient major depressive episode is yet to be explored, despite its clinical importance. To address this gap in the literature, we have used baseline clinical, structural imaging, blood-biomarker, genetic (polygenic risk scores), bioelectrical impedance and electrocardiography predictors to predict rehospitalization within 2 years of an initial inpatient episode of major depression. Three hundred and eighty patients from the ongoing 12-year Bidirect study were included in the analysis (rehospitalized: yes = 102, no = 278). Inclusion criteria was age ≥35 and &lt;66 years, a current or recent hospitalisation for a major depressive episode and complete structural imaging and genetic data. Optimal performance was achieved with a multimodal panel containing structural imaging, blood-biomarker, clinical, medication type, and sleep quality predictors, attaining a test AUC of 67.74 (p = 9.99<sup>-05</sup>). This multimodal solution outperformed models based on clinical variables alone, combined biomarkers, and individual data modality prognostication for rehospitalization prediction. This finding points to the potential of predictive models that combine multimodal clinical and biomarker data in the development of clinical decision support systems.</AbstractText>"}

Here we explored a link between two risk factors that converge on a shared neurobiological pathway. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk variants in genes that code for L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), while epidemiological studies have found an increased risk of schizophrenia in those with neonatal vitamin D deficiency. The active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D) is a secosteroid that rapidly modulates L-VGCCs via non-genomic mechanisms in a range of peripheral tissues, though its non-genomic effects within the brain remain largely unexplored. Here we used calcium imaging, electrophysiology and molecular biology to determine whether 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D non-genomically modulated L-VGCCs in the developing prefrontal cortex, a region widely implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed that physiological concentrations of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D rapidly enhanced activity-dependent somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in a small subset of neurons in the developing PFC, termed vitamin D-responsive neurons (VDRNs). Somatic nucleated patch recordings revealed a rapid, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D-evoked increase in high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. Enhanced activity-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were mediated by L-VGCC but not associated with any changes to Cacna1c (L-VGCC pore-forming subunit) mRNA expression. Since L-VGCC activity is critical to healthy neurodevelopment, these data suggest that suboptimal concentrations of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D could alter brain maturation through modulation of L-VGCC signalling and as such may provide a parsimonious link between epidemiologic and genetic risk factors for schizophrenia.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, it was discovered that the inhibition of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a conserved complex that mediates nutrient status and cell metabolism, can extend an individual's lifespan and inhibit age-related diseases in many model organisms. However, the mechanism whereby TORC1 affects aging remains elusive. Here, we use a loss-of-function mutation in <i>nprl2</i>, a component of GATOR1 that mediates amino acid levels and inhibits TORC1 activity, to investigate the effect of increased TORC1 activity on the occurrence of age-related digestive dysfunction in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that the <i>nprl2</i> mutation decreased <i>Drosophila</i> lifespan. Furthermore, the <i>nprl2</i> mutant had a distended crop, with food accumulation at an early age. Interestingly, the inappropriate food distribution and digestion along with decreased crop contraction in <i>nprl2</i> mutant can be rescued by decreasing TORC1 activity. In addition, <i>nprl2</i>-mutant flies exhibited age-related phenotypes in the midgut, including short gut length, a high rate of intestinal stem cell proliferation, and metabolic dysfunction, which could be rescued by inhibiting TORC1 activity. Our findings showed that the gastrointestinal tract aging process is accelerated in <i>nprl2</i>-mutant flies, owing to high TORC1 activity, which suggested that TORC1 promotes digestive tract senescence.</AbstractText>"}

The imbalance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis accounts for the dysfunction and clearance of mitochondria during BAT whitening. Capsaicin, a dietary factor activating TRPV1, can inhibit obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD), but whether capsaicin inhibits BAT loss and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we determined that the inhibitory effects capsaicin on HFD-induced obesity and BAT whitening were dependent on the participation of SIRT3, a critical mitochondrial deacetylase. SIRT3 also mediated all the beneficial effects of capsaicin on alleviating ROS generation, elevating mitochondrial activity and restricting mitochondrial calcium overload induced by HFD. Mechanistically, SIRT3 inhibits mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)-mediated mitochondrial calcium overload by reducing the H3K27ac level on MCU promoter in an AMPK-dependent manner. In addition, HFD also inhibits AMPK activity to reduce SIRT3 expression, which could be reversed by capsaicin. Capsaicin intervention also inhibited aging-induced BAT whitening through this mechanism. In conclusion, this study emphasizes a critical role of AMPK/SIRT3 pathway in the maintenance of BAT morphology and function, and suggests that intervention in this pathway may be an effective target for preventing obesity or age-related metabolic diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Increasing evidence questions the utility of trial-/group averaged power estimates however, as seemingly sustained activity patterns may be brought about by time-varying transient signals in each single trial. Hence, it is crucial to accurately describe the duration and power of rhythmic and arrhythmic neural responses on the single trial-level. However, it is less clear how well this can be achieved in empirical MEG/EEG/LFP recordings. Here, we extend an existing rhythm detection algorithm (extended Better OSCillation detection: 'eBOSC'; cf. Whitten et al., 2011) to systematically investigate boundary conditions for estimating neural rhythms at the single-trial level. Using simulations as well as resting and task-based EEG recordings from a micro-longitudinal assessment, we show that alpha rhythms can be successfully captured in single trials with high specificity, but that the quality of single-trial estimates varies greatly between subjects. Despite those signal-to-noise-based limitations, we highlight the utility and potential of rhythm detection with multiple proof-of-concept examples, and discuss implications for single-trial analyses of neural rhythms in electrophysiological recordings. Using an applied example of working memory retention, rhythm detection indicated load-related increases in the duration of frontal theta and posterior alpha rhythms, in addition to a frequency decrease of frontal theta rhythms that was observed exclusively through amplification of rhythmic amplitudes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here we focus on longitudinal change along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) trajectory and demonstrate the utility of Template Based Rotation (TBR) in detecting differential longitudinal rs-fcMRI change between higher and lower amyloid burden individuals with mildly impaired cognition. Specifically, we examine a small (N = 24), but densely sampled (~5 observations over ~3 years), cohort of symptomatic individuals with serial rs-fcMRI imaging and PiB-PET imaging for β-amyloid pathology. We observed longitudinal decline of the Default Mode and Salience network axis (DMN/SAL) among impaired individuals with high amyloid burden. No other networks showed differential change in high vs. low amyloid individuals over time. The standardized effect size of AD related DMN/SAL change is comparable to the standardized effect size of amyloid-related change on the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and hippocampal volume (HV). Last, we show that the AD-related change in DMN/SAL connectivity is almost completely independent of change on MMSE or HV, suggesting that rs-fcMRI is sensitive to an aspect of AD progression that is not captured by these other measures.

Alterations in telomere length are indicative of cellular aging and, possibly, neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated the effect of WF inhalation on telomere length and markers of neurodegeneration in whole brain tissue in rats. Male Fischer-344 (F-344) rats were exposed by inhalation to stainless steel WF (20 mg/m<sup>3</sup> x 3 h/d x 4 d/wk x 5 wk) or filtered air (control). Telomere length, DNA-methylation, gene expression of Trf1, Trf2, ATM, and APP, protein expression of p-Tau, α-synuclein, and presenilin 1 and 2 were assessed in whole brain tissue at 12 wk after WF exposure ended. Results suggest that WF inhalation increased telomere length without affecting telomerase in whole brain. Moreover, we observed that components of the shelterin complex, Trf1 and Trf2, play an important role in telomere end protection, and their regulation may be responsible for the increase in telomere length. In addition, expression of different neurodegeneration markers, such as p-Tau, presenilin 1-2 and α-synuclein proteins, were increased in brain tissue from the WF-exposed rats as compared to control. These findings suggest a possible correlation between epigenetic modifications, telomere length alteration, and neurodegeneration because of the presence of factors in serum after WF exposure that may cause extra-pulmonary effects as well as the translocation of potentially neurotoxic metals associated with WF to the central nervous system (CNS). Further studies are needed to investigate the brain region specificity and temporal response of these effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We suggest that baboons can serve as a valuable model for complex evolutionary processes, such as speciation and hybridization. The evolution of baboons has been heavily shaped by climatic changes and population expansion and fragmentation in the African savanna environment, similar to the processes that acted during human evolution. With accumulating long-term data, and new data from previously understudied species, baboons are ideally suited for investigating the links between sociality, health, longevity and reproductive success. To achieve these aims, we propose a closer integration of studies at the proximate level, including functional genomics, with behavioral and ecological studies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, Fischer et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The normal aging processes and HIV-induced immune dysfunction, are potential mechanisms, driving multimorbidity (MM) in PLWH. MM is the concurrent presence of two or more diseases in a single individual. Aging PLWH, are at increased risk of acute and chronic morbidities compared with counterpart without HIV. Despite increasing concern in Nigeria, research on correlates of MM in aging PLWH is lagging. This was a comparative study, of ≥60 years of age, age-matched (±5 years) HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Patients were recruited, from the Infectious Disease Institute and Geriatric clinics of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, between April and June 2018. MM was defined as the occurrence of more than two morbidities in an individual, and it was considered acute, when within 30 days and chronic, when above 3-months duration. Data analysis was done using SPSS 23. We studied 186 individuals (62 HIV-positive and 124 HIV-negative). The PLWH had lower mean age (63.9 vs. 68.1 years, <i>p</i> = .00, <i>t</i> = 5.68), more chronic MM (2.0 vs. 1.3, <i>p</i> = .004, <i>t</i> = 2.970), which occurred earlier (4.7 vs. 9.6 years, <i>p</i> = .003, <i>t</i> = 3.05), more overall MM (3.6 vs. 2.8, <i>p</i> = .015, <i>t</i> = 2.448), and lower quality of life (82.7 vs. 86.2, <i>p</i> = .002, <i>t</i> = 3.130). Risk estimates for 'any' MM revealed the odds are in favor of the older PLWH [69.4% vs. 46.8%, <i>p</i> = .004, odds ratio = 0.388 (95% confidence interval = 0.204-0.740)]. Logistic regression revealed, age &gt;64 years, higher total body fat, lower nadir CD4 counts, and longer duration of HIV infection, were significantly associated with MM in aging PLWH (<i>p</i> = .019). Older individuals with HIV on antiretrovirals in Ibadan, had a significantly greater burden of MM compared with those without HIV. HIV treatment programs in Nigeria will need to adapt a comprehensive health care plan for aging PLWH.</AbstractText>"}

We compared the accuracy, continuity, and gene annotation of genome assemblies generated from either high-fidelity (HiFi) or continuous long-read (CLR) datasets from the same complete hydatidiform mole human genome. We find that the HiFi sequence data assemble an additional 10% of duplicated regions and more accurately represent the structure of tandem repeats, as validated with orthogonal analyses. As a result, an additional 5 Mbp of pericentromeric sequences are recovered in the HiFi assembly, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in the NG50 within 1 Mbp of the centromere (HiFi 480.6 kbp, CLR 191.5 kbp). Additionally, the HiFi genome assembly was generated in significantly less time with fewer computational resources than the CLR assembly. Although the HiFi assembly has significantly improved continuity and accuracy in many complex regions of the genome, it still falls short of the assembly of centromeric DNA and the largest regions of segmental duplication using existing assemblers. Despite these shortcomings, our results suggest that HiFi may be the most effective standalone technology for de novo assembly of human genomes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd/University College London.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Human studies are limited but suggest an association with improved bone healing after hip fracture. We examined the relationship between AChEI use and fracture risk in a national cohort of 360,015 male veterans aged 65 to 99 years with dementia but without prior fracture using Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital, Medicare, and pharmacy records from 2000 to 2010. Diagnosis of dementia, any clinical fracture (excluding facial and digital), comorbidities, and medications were identified using ICD-9 and drug class codes. Cox proportional hazard models considering AChEI use as a time-varying covariate and adjusting for fall and fracture risk factors compared the time-to-fracture in AChEI users versus non-AChEI users. Potential confounders included demographics (age, race, body mass index), comorbidities associated with fracture or falls (diabetes, lung disease, stroke, Parkinson's, seizures, etc.) and medications associated with fracture or falls (bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, androgen deprivation therapy [ADT], proton pump inhibitors [PPIs], selective serotonin receptor inhibitors [SSRIs], etc.). Competing mortality risk was considered using the methods of Fine and Gray. To account for persistent effects on bone density or quality that might confer protection after stopping the medication, we completed a secondary analysis using the medication possession ratio (MPR) as a continuous variable in logistic regression models and also compared MPR increments of 10% to minimal/no use (MPR 0 to &lt;0.10). Among older veterans with diagnosis of dementia, 20.1% suffered a fracture over an average of 4.6 years of follow-up. Overall, 42.3% of the cohort were prescribed AChEIs during the study period. The hazard of any fracture among AChEI users compared with those on other/no dementia medications was significantly lower in fully adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.88).

It is characterized by internal fertilization, long-term sperm storage in the female ovary and a high abortion rate. For better understanding the mechanism of fertilization and gestation, it is essential to establish a reference genome for viviparous teleosts. Herein, we used a combination of Pacific Biosciences sequel, Illumina sequencing platforms, 10x Genomics and Hi-C technology to obtain a genome assembly size of 848.31 Mb comprising 24 chromosomes, and contig and scaffold N50 lengths of 2.96 Mb and 35.63 Mb, respectively. We predicted 39.98% repetitive elements, and 26,979 protein-coding genes. S. schlegelii diverged from Gasterosteus aculeatus approximately 32.1-56.8 million years ago. Furthermore, sperm remained viable within the ovary for up to 6 months. The glucose transporter SLC2 showed significantly positive genomic selection, and carbohydrate metabolism-related KEGG pathways were significantly up-regulated in ovaries after copulation. In vitro suppression of glycolysis with sodium iodoacetate reduced sperm longevity significantly. The results indicated the importance of carbohydrates in maintaining sperm survivability. Decoding the S. schlegelii genome not only provides new insights into sperm storage; additionally, it is highly valuable for marine researchers and reproduction biologists.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), HTE is typically examined through a subgroup analysis that contrasts effects in groups of patients defined '1 variable at a time' (for example, male vs. female or old vs. young). The authors of this statement present guidance on an alternative approach to HTE analysis, 'predictive HTE analysis.' The goal of predictive HTE analysis is to provide patient-centered estimates of outcome risks with versus without the intervention, taking into account all relevant patient attributes simultaneously. The PATH (Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity) Statement was developed using a multidisciplinary technical expert panel, targeted literature reviews, simulations to characterize potential problems with predictive approaches, and a deliberative process engaging the expert panel. The authors distinguish 2 categories of predictive HTE approaches: a 'risk-modeling' approach, wherein a multivariable model predicts the risk for an outcome and is applied to disaggregate patients within RCTs to define risk-based variation in benefit, and an 'effect-modeling' approach, wherein a model is developed on RCT data by incorporating a term for treatment assignment and interactions between treatment and baseline covariates. Both approaches can be used to predict differential absolute treatment effects, the most relevant scale for clinical decision making. The authors developed 4 sets of guidance: criteria to determine when risk-modeling approaches are likely to identify clinically important HTE, methodological aspects of risk-modeling methods, considerations for translation to clinical practice, and considerations and caveats in the use of effect-modeling approaches. The PATH Statement, together with its explanation and elaboration document, may guide future analyses and reporting of RCTs.</AbstractText>"}

The goal of this systematic review was to summarize existing evidence linking FI and general or specific cognitive functions in middle and older adulthood. A systematic search of human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2018 was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CAB Direct. Four independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of identified articles and conducted data extraction and data quality assessment. Ten studies were included in the review, including 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial, 2 longitudinal studies, and 7 cross-sectional studies. Three studies reported the association between early-life FI experience and a global cognitive function measure. Nine studies reported later-life FI experience in relation to global or specific cognitive functions. The results suggest an adverse association between FI experienced in early or later life and global cognitive function; and between later-life FI and executive function and memory. Findings from the review are preliminary because of sparse data, heterogeneity across study populations, exposure and outcome assessments, and potential risk of bias across studies. Future studies are recommended to better understand the role of FI in cognitive function, with the goal of identifying possible critical windows for correction of FI in vulnerable subpopulations to prevent neurocognitive deficit in adulthood.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We performed a GWAS of the rate of ventricular enlargement using 507 nondemented non-Hispanic white participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Linear regression model was used to identify the association of the rate of ventricular enlargement with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLINK software. The associations of genome-wide significant SNPs with other four phenotypes were further discussed. Two SNPs (rs11620312, P = 4.04×10<sup>-8</sup>; rs79174114, P = 4.28×10<sup>-8</sup>) within <i>SIAH3</i> gene in linkage disequilibrium (LD) reached genome-wide significance for association with increased rate of ventricular enlargement.

We estimated hippocampal volumes in 39 healthy controls and 124 stroke participants at three months, and 38 controls and 113 stroke participants at one year. We used intra-class correlation, concordance, and reduced major axis regression to assess agreement between automated and 'Manual' estimations. A linear mixed-effect model was used to characterize hippocampal atrophy. Overall, hippocampal volumes were reduced by 3.9% in first-ever stroke and 9.2% in recurrent stroke at three months post-stroke, with comparable ipsi-and contra-lesional reductions in first-ever stroke. Mean atrophy rates between time points were 0.5% for controls and 1.0% for stroke patients (0.6% contra-lesionally, 1.4% ipsi-lesionally). Atrophy rates in left and right-hemisphere strokes were comparable. All methods revealed significant volume change in first-ever and ipsi-lesional stroke (p &lt; 0.001). Hippocampal volume estimation was not impacted by hemisphere, study group, or scan time point, but rather, by the interaction between the automated segmentation method and hippocampal size. Compared to Manual, Subfields and FIRST recorded the lowest bias. FreeSurfer/v5.3 overestimated volumes the most for large hippocampi, while FIRST was the most accurate in estimating small volumes. AdaBoost performance was average. Our findings suggest that first-year ipsi-lesional hippocampal atrophy rate especially in first-ever stroke, is greater than atrophy rates in healthy controls and contra-lesional stroke. Subfields and FIRST can complementarily be effective in characterizing the hippocampal atrophy in healthy and stroke cohorts.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the protective effects of piperine, an alkaloid nutrient component of Piper nigrum, against cognitive impairment in a senescent mouse model induced by D-galactose (D-Gal) and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Senescent mouse model was established by repeated subcutaneous injection of D-Gal (150 mg/kg, once daily for 42 days). Fourteen days after the first D-Gal exposure, piperine (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered once daily for 28 days. The cognitive function of mice was evaluated by Morris water maze test (MWM). Twenty-four hours after behavioral test, the cholinergic function and oxidative stress level in mouse hippocampus were measured by spectrophotometric assays. In addition, the hippocampal levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6, were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expressions of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and its upstream or downstream molecules including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)，protein kinase B (AKT), protein kinase C (PKC), NF-E2-related factor 2, nuclear factor-κB and microtubule-associated protein tau in hippocampus were determined by western blotting, immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent staining. Our data revealed that chronic D-Gal exposure in mice led to cognitive impairment in MWM, along with cholinergic malfunction, extensive oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, as well as hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in hippocampus. All these neurochemical, neuroinflammatory and cognitive alterations could be ameliorated by 4-week repeated piperine administration. Moreover, piperine also reversed D-Gal-induced GSK-3β activation through modulating PKC and PI3K/AKT pathways in senescent mouse hippocampus, suggesting GSK-3β-related signaling might be involved in the benefits of piperine against D-Gal-induced cognitive decline in mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The same tests were employed to evaluate the influence of wax finishing on the ageing behaviour of Chinese Ash (Fraxinus mandshurica) wood surfaces. Ageing effects were evaluated by direct and microscopic observation, colour measurements in the CIELab system and FTIR investigations. The results yielded by both accelerated UV ageing (72 h) and simulated indoors natural ageing (6 months) indicate that the waxes under analysis here are materials with a good ageing resistance. FTIR investigation revealed only minor chemical changes following ageing, more evident with beeswax than with Chinese wax. Finishing Chinese Ash wood surfaces with the two types of waxes influenced their ageing behaviour in terms of colour and surface chemistry changes. For both UV and natural ageing the maximum colour differences occurred for the samples finished with Chinese wax. The colour differences ΔE after 72 h accelerated UV ageing were in all the cases higher than those occurring after 6 months of indoors simulated natural ageing. Acceleration indexes for UV exposure compared to exposure to natural window-filtered sunlight, of about 40X-60X, were calculated. Both UV accelerated ageing and natural simulated ageing resulted in significant surface chemistry changes for the unfinished Chinese ash wood samples, consisting mostly in lignin degradation and formation of carbonyl containing chromophores. FTIR investigation of wax finish wood samples revealed only very minor chemical changes of the top wax layers, although chemical changes occurring beneath the coating layer on the wood surface are highly probable. Overall, the experiments presented in this paper indicate that Chinese wax seems slightly more resistant to ageing than beeswax.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Until now, six patients with this condition have been reported in the literature. In addition to skeletal overgrowth, these patients exhibit hyperelastic, translucent, and fragile skin, scoliosis, progressive loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, skull deformity, infantile myofibromas, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and arachnoid cysts in the posterior fossa and periventricular white matter signal abnormalities on neuroimaging. This constellation of phenotypes clearly distinguishes KOGS from other PDGFRB-related disorders, including idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, infantile myofibroma, and Penttinen-type premature aging syndrome. From a molecular standpoint, PDGFRB is a dimeric receptor tyrosine kinase that plays critical roles in cell growth and tumorigenesis. The two known types of pathogenic variants (p.(Pro584Arg) and p.(Trp566Arg)) of the PDGFRB that cause KOGS are exclusively located in the juxtaglomerular domain that regulates autoactivation/inhibition of PDGFRB. In-vitro evidence suggests that p.(Pro584Arg) represents a gain-of-function pathogenic variant. Inhibition of PDGFRB activity using multi-kinase inhibitors appears to be a potentially promising therapeutic approach. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease using induced pluripotent stem cells is under way. Presence of skeletal overgrowth, distinctive facial features, characteristic hyperelastic and fragile skin, and cerebral white matter lesions with neuropsychiatric symptoms should prompt genetic analysis of the PDGFRB.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We described pollen and nectar presentation, analysed the breeding system and the foraging strategy of bee pollinators. We determined the nectar production pattern and documented variations in the longevity of floral phases and stigmatic pollen loads of pollinator-visited and unvisited flowers. Bicolletes indigoticus (Colletidae) was the sole pollinator with females revisiting flowers in staminate and pistillate phases at short intervals, guaranteeing cross-pollen flow. Nectar stored in the nectar scale-staminode complex had a high sugar concentration and was produced continuously in minute amounts (~0.09 μl·h<sup>-1</sup> ). Pushing the scales outward, bees took up nectar, triggering stamen movements and accelerating pollen presentation. Experimental simulation of this nectar uptake increased the number of moved stamens per hour by a factor of four. Flowers visited by pollinators received six-fold more pollen on the stigma than unvisited flowers, had shortened staminate and pistillate phases and increased fruit and seed set. Flower handling and foraging by Bicolletes indigoticus were consonant with the complex flower morphology and functioning of Blumenbachia insignis. Continuous nectar production in minute quantities but at high sugar concentration influences the pollen foraging of the bees. Partitioning of resources lead to absolute flower fidelity and stereotyped foraging behaviour by the sole effective oligolectic bee pollinator.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences, Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Only 86 commonly downregulated genes were enriched in GO terms of the carbohydrate derivative catabolic process. Additionally, transcriptome analysis of alternative splicing (AS) events in I178 and X178 showed that 63.6% of transcript isoforms occurred AS in all samples, and only 1.6% of transcript isoforms contained 169 genes that exhibited aging-specific AS arising after aging treatment.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 40 participants received 1000 mg NR or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before and after the intervention. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was determined by high-resolution respirometry on single muscle fibres.

Important changes in the phenolic profile, browning index, and glutathione content were observed in the sparkling wines during the over-lees aging period. The major phenolic compound in the sparkling wines was tyrosol, followed by caffeic, trans-caftaric, and gallic acids, catechin and epicatechin. The biological aging led to an increase in the individual phenolic compounds, especially caffeic, gallic, and ellagic acids, and an increase in the browning index was also observed during the aging period. Caffeic acid was significantly correlated with browning and aging period in all sparkling wines, which indicates that this compound can be useful as a quality marker to monitoring the biological aging profile of white sparkling wines. The results obtained indicate that the aging period (sur lie) had an important influence on the changes in the unique phenolic profile of the sparkling wines elaborated with nontraditional varieties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In sparkling wines production, the secondary fermentation occurring in the sealed bottle during the vinification contributes greatly to their quality and sensory complexity. The Vitis labrusca and hybrid grapes varieties represent most of the grapes cultivated in Brazil being employed in the elaboration of juices and wines. These varieties present a great oenological potential and have not been explored yet regarding to the production of white sparkling wines. The use of these nontraditional grape varieties cultivated in South Brazil may be a viable alternative in the production of white sparkling wines with biological aging potential and particular bioactive properties.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the exact regions where the difficulties arise have not been fully identified. In this study, a maze task was implemented to investigate how older adults and younger adults differentially processed two types of sentences with different levels of syntactic complexity, namely subject relative clauses and object relative clauses. Participants were asked to choose between two alternatives at each segment of the sentences. The task required participants to engage in a strictly incremental mode of processing. The reading times for each segment were recorded, allowing the quantification of the difficulty of sentence reading. The task allowed us to identify the exact locations of the processing difficulty and thus facilitate a more accurate assessment of the age-related decline in sentence processing. The results indicate that the effect of ageing was found mainly at the head nouns, but not at other regions of the sentences, a finding which suggests that the maze task is an effective method to identify the exact location of the ageing effect on sentence processing. The implications of this experimental paradigm for investigating the effect of ageing on sentence processing are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The present study investigated the effect of a pearl millet porridge (PMP) compared with a well-known Scottish oats porridge (SOP) on glycaemic, gastrointestinal, hormonal and appetitive responses. In a randomised, two-way crossover trial, twenty-six healthy participants consumed two isoenergetic/isovolumetric PMP or SOP breakfast meals, served with a drink of water. Blood samples for glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), peptide YY, gastric volumes and appetite ratings were collected 2 h postprandially, followed by an ad libitum meal and food intake records for the remainder of the day. The incremental AUC (iAUC2h) for blood glucose was not significantly different between the porridges (P &gt; 0·05). The iAUC2h for gastric volume was larger for PMP compared with SOP (P = 0·045). The iAUC2h for GIP concentration was significantly lower for PMP compared with SOP (P = 0·001). Other hormones and appetite responses were similar between meals. In conclusion, the present study reports, for the first time, data on glycaemic and physiological responses to a pearl millet breakfast, showing that this ancient grain could represent a sustainable alternative with health-promoting characteristics comparable with oats. GIP is an incretin hormone linked to TAG absorption in adipose tissue; therefore, the lower GIP response for PMP may be an added health benefit.</AbstractText>"}

Factors identified being associated with the number of GP consultations were organizational changes in primary health care, economic recession causing retrenchment, and even vaccinations during the swine flu epidemic.Key pointsAlong with an increasingly ageing population, concern over the supply of publicly funded health care has become more pronounced.The amount of GP visits of 65+ decreased in primary health care, especially in the youngest groups.However, in the oldest age groups (85+), the use of GPs remained unchanged regardless of changes in service supply.As the rate of GP visits among the population of 65+ declined, the positive trend in the mortality rate ceased.</AbstractText>"}

However, whether extracellular adenosine alters direct host-pathogen interaction remains unexplored. An important determinant for lung infection by S. pneumoniae is its ability to adhere to the pulmonary epithelium. Here we explored whether extracellular adenosine can directly impact bacterial adherence to lung epithelial cells. We found that signaling via A1 adenosine receptor significantly reduced the ability of pneumococci to bind human pulmonary epithelial cells. A1 receptor signaling blocked bacterial binding by reducing the expression of platelet-activating factor receptor, a host protein used by S. pneumoniae to adhere to host cells. In vivo, A1 was required for control of pneumococcal pneumonia as inhibiting it resulted in increased host susceptibility. As S. pneumoniae remain a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly, we explored the role of A1 in the age-driven susceptibility to infection. We found no difference in A1 pulmonary expression in young versus old mice. Strikingly, triggering A1 signaling boosted host resistance of old mice to S. pneumoniae pulmonary infection. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which extracellular adenosine modulates resistance to lung infection by targeting bacterial-host interactions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the role of dMRI in characterizing different aspects of bone quality, especially in aging and osteoporosis, has not yet been fully established, particularly in clinical applications. The reason lies in the complications accompanied with implementation of dMRI in assessment of human bone structure, in terms of acquisition and quantification. Bone is a composite tissue comprising different elements, each contributing to the overall quality and functional competence of bone. As diffusion is a critical biophysical process in biological tissues, early changes of tissue microstructure and function can affect diffusive properties of the tissue. While there are multiple MRI methods to detect variations of individual properties of bone quality due to aging and osteoporosis, dMRI has potential to serve as a superior method for characterizing different aspects of bone quality within the same framework but with higher sensitivity to early alterations. This is mainly because several properties of the tissue including directionality and anisotropy of trabecular bone and cell density can be collected using only dMRI. In this review article, we first describe components of human bone that can be potentially detected by their diffusivity properties and contribute to variations in bone quality during aging and osteoporosis. Then we discuss considerations and challenges of dMRI in bone imaging, current status, and suggestions for development of dMRI in research studies and clinics to segregate different contributing components of bone quality in an integrated acquisition.

Prior reports suggest that a human-like adrenarche, associated with a sharp prepubertal increase in DHEA/S, may only occur in the genus Pan. However, the timing and variability in adrenarche in chimpanzees remain poorly described, owing to the lack of longitudinal data, or data from wild populations. Here, we use urine samples from East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) collected over 20 years at Kanyawara in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to trace the developmental trajectories of DHEAS (n = 1,385 samples, 53 individuals) and cortisol (n = 12,726 samples, 68 individuals). We used generalized additive models (GAM) to investigate the relationship between age, sex, and hormone levels. Adrenarche began earlier in chimpanzees (~2-3 years) compared with what has been reported in humans (6-8 years) and, unlike humans, male and female chimpanzees did not differ significantly in the timing of adrenarche nor in DHEAS concentrations overall. Similar to what has been reported in humans, cortisol production decreased through early life, reaching a nadir around puberty (8-11 years), and a sex difference emerged with males exhibiting higher urinary cortisol levels compared with females by early adulthood (15-16 years). Our study establishes that wild chimpanzees exhibit a human-like pattern of cortisol production during development and corroborates prior reports from captive chimpanzees of a human-like adrenarche, accompanied by significant developmental increases in DHEAS. While the role of these developmental hormone shifts are as yet unclear, they have been implicated in stages of rapid behavioral development once thought unique to humans, especially in regard to explaining the divergence of female and male social behavior before pubertal increases in gonadal hormones.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady-state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen-specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

To examine the effect of infarct size on post-stroke infection, we utilised the intraluminal middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of ischemic stroke and adjusted the duration of arterial occlusion. At 1 day following stroke onset, the proportion of mice with infection was significantly greater in mice that had larger infarct sizes. Additionally, the presence of lung infection in these mice with severe strokes extended past 2 days, suggestive of long-term immune impairment. At the acute phase, our data demonstrated an inverse relationship between infarct volume and the number of circulating leukocytes, indicating the elevated risk of infection in more severe stroke is associated with reduced cellularity in peripheral blood, owing predominately to markedly decreased lymphocyte numbers. In addition, the stroke-induced reduction of lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio was also evident in the lung of all post-stroke animals. To investigate the effect of infarct location on post-stroke infection, we additionally performed a photothrombotic (PT) model of stroke and using an innovative systematic approach of analysis, we found the location of cerebral infarct does not impact on the susceptibility of post-stroke infection, confirming the greater role of infarct volume over infarct location in the susceptibility to infection. Our experimental findings were validated in a clinical setting and reinforced that stroke severity, and not infarct location, influences the risk of infection after stroke.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, the effects of sex steroids (i.e. testosterone and 17β-estradiol) on the differentiation capacity of human bone-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), as progenitors of osteoblasts and adipocytes, are of particular interest. The objectives of the present study were, thus, to elucidate whether bone-derived hMSCs of postmenopausal women produce aromatase (CYP19A1) and, whether they modulate their differentiation behaviour in response to testosterone and 17β-estradiol (E2), in relation to their steroid receptor expression. Supplementation of testosterone resulted in a considerable formation of E2 under osteogenic and adipogenic culture conditions, whereas E2 synthesis remained minimal in the cells cultured in basal medium. Concomitant with high aromatase expression and 17β-estradiol formation of the cells cultured in osteogenic medium supplemented with testosterone, a distinct promotion of late-stage osteogenesis was found, as shown by significant matrix mineralization and a notable increase in osteogenic markers. These effects were abrogated by the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Under adipogenic conditions, testosterone reduced the occurrence of lipid droplets and led to a decrease in <i>PPARγ</i> and <i>AR</i> expression, independent of anastrozole. Regardless of the culture conditions, <i>ERα</i> was detectable whilst <i>ERβ</i> was not. In conclusion, aromatase activity is limited to differentiated hMSCs and the resulting 17β-estradiol enhances late osteogenic differentiation stages via <i>ERα</i>. Adipogenic differentiation, on the other hand, is reduced by both sex steroids: testosterone via <i>AR</i> and 17β-estradiol.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although older RA and OA ST showed proportions of senescent cells similar to older normal ST, senescence was increased in younger RA ST compared to age-matched normal ST. The percentage of senescent SA-β-gal(+) SF after 14 days in culture positively correlated with donor's age.

Interestingly, breastfeeding has proven to be protective against the early onset of immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes. Studies have shown that exosomes from human breast milk are enriched in immune-modulating miRNAs suggesting that exosomal miRNAs (exomiRs) transferred to the infant could play a critical role in the development of the infant's immune system. We extracted exomiRs from breast milk of 52 lactating mothers (26 mothers with type 1 diabetes and 26 healthy mothers), to identify any differences in the exomiR content between the two groups. Small RNA-sequencing was performed to identify known and novel miRNAs in both groups. A total of 631 exomiRs were detected by small RNA sequencing including immune-related miRNAs such as hsa-let-7c, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-146b, and hsa-miR-200b. In addition, ~200 novel miRNAs were identified in both type 1 diabetes and control samples. Among the known miRNAs, nine exomiR's were found differentially expressed in mothers with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy mothers. The highly up-regulated miRNAs, hsa-miR-4497, and hsa-miR-3178, increased lipopolysaccharide-induced expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in human monocytes. The up-regulated miRNA target genes were significantly enriched for longevity-regulating pathways and FoxO signaling.

Interestingly, individual sensory preferences have been observed in this context: subjects who compensate less for somatosensory perturbations compensate more for auditory perturbations, and <i>vice versa</i>. We propose to integrate this sensory preference phenomenon in a model of speech motor planning using a probabilistic model in which speech units are characterized both in auditory and somatosensory terms. Sensory preference is implemented in the model according to two approaches. In the first approach, which is often used in motor control models accounting for sensory integration, sensory preference is attributed to the relative precision (i.e., inverse of the variance) of the sensory characterization of the speech motor goals associated with phonological units (which are phonemes in the context of this paper). In the second, 'more original' variant, sensory preference is implemented by modulating the sensitivity of the comparison between the predicted sensory consequences of motor commands and the sensory characterizations of the phonemes. We present simulation results using these two variants, in the context of the adaptation to an auditory perturbation, implemented in a 2-dimensional biomechanical model of the tongue. Simulation results show that both variants lead to qualitatively similar results. Distinguishing them experimentally would require precise analyses of partial compensation patterns. However, the second proposed variant implements sensory preference without changing the sensory characterizations of the phonemes. This dissociates sensory preference and sensory characterizations of the phonemes, and makes the account of sensory preference more flexible. Indeed, in the second variant the sensory characterizations of the phonemes can remain stable, when sensory preference varies as a response to cognitive or attentional control. This opens new perspectives for capturing speech production variability associated with aging, disorders and speaking conditions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Patri, Diard and Perrier.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Physiologically, functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes is often discussed as long-term mediators of risk. In particular, DNA methylation in the glucocorticoid receptor gene promoter (<i>NR3C1</i>) has been associated with type and strength of early life adversity and subsequent effects on HPA axis signaling in humans. Animal studies, moreover, suggest changes in DNA methylation in the estrogen receptor gene (<i>ER</i>α) upon early life adversity. We investigated the association of type and severity of childhood adversity with methylation in <i>NR3C1</i> and <i>ER</i>α and additionally considered associations between methylation and steroid hormone secretion. <b>Methods:</b> The percentage of methylation within the <i>NR3C1</i> promoter and the <i>ER</i>α shore was investigated using dried blood spot samples of 103 healthy women aged 40-73 years. Childhood adversity was examined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Linear regression analyses were performed with methylation as dependent variable and the experience of emotional abuse and neglect, physical abuse and neglect, and sexual abuse (compared to non-experience) as independent variables. All analyses were controlled for age, BMI, annual household income, and smoking status and were adjusted for multiple testing. <b>Results:</b> Overall, over 70% of the sample reported having experienced any kind of abuse or neglect of at least low intensity. There were no significant associations between childhood adversity and methylation in the <i>NR3C1</i> promoter (all <i>p</i> &gt; .10). Participants reporting emotional abuse showed significantly higher methylation in the <i>ER</i>α shore than those who did not (<i>p</i> = .001). Additionally, higher levels of adversity were associated with higher levels of <i>ER</i>α shore methylation (<i>p</i> = .001). <b>Conclusion:</b> In healthy women, early life adversity does not seem to result in NR3C1 promoter hypermethylation in midlife and older age. This is the first study in humans to suggest that childhood adversity might, however, epigenetically modify the ERα shore. Further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of why some individuals remain healthy and others develop psychopathologies in the face of childhood adversity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Fiacco, Gardini, Mernone, Schick and Ehlert.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This decrease is suggested to reflect a reduced capacity for locomotor adaptation in older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential differences between physical activity-matched young and older adults' fractal dynamics and gait adaptability during unperturbed and asymmetric walking, and to determine if fractal dynamics predict adaptive capacity. Fifteen young (28.9 ± 5.6 years, nine women) and 15 older (64.7 ± 2.7, nine women) adults with similar habitual physical activity levels walked at preferred speed, half of preferred speed, and asymmetrically whereby their dominant and non-dominant legs moved at preferred and half-preferred speed, respectively. Fractal correlations (scaling exponent α) of stride times were assessed through detrended fluctuation analysis, and gait adaptation to asymmetric walking on the basis of lower limb relative phase. Both cohorts displayed similar fractal dynamics at preferred speed and asymmetric walking, while older adults exhibited greater α during slow walking. Both groups exhibited comparable gait adaptation to split-belt walking based on analysis of lower limb relative phase. Fractal dynamics during preferred speed and asymmetric walking was moderately associated with gait adaptation in the young and older adult cohorts, respectively. In these activity-matched groups, there were no age-based reductions in fractal dynamics or gait adaptation, and fractal scaling α was moderately associated with gait adaptation. These findings suggest that stride time fractal dynamics and gait adaptation may be preserved in older adults who habitually perform moderate intensity physical activity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ducharme, Kent and van Emmerik.</CopyrightInformation>"}

MxD describes the coexistence of AD pathology with vascular pathology, including cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Cardiovascular disease increases risk for AD and MxD, but mechanistic synergisms between the coexisting pathologies affecting dementia risk, progression and the ultimate clinical manifestations remain elusive. To explore the additive or synergistic interactions between AD and chronic hypertension, we developed a rat model of MxD, produced by breeding APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenes into the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) background, resulting in the SHRSP/FAD model and three control groups (FAD, SHRSP and non-hypertensive WKY rats, <i>n</i> = 8-11, both sexes, 16-18 months of age). After behavioral testing, rats were euthanized, and tissue assessed for vascular, neuroinflammatory and AD pathology. Hypertension was preserved in the SHRSP/FAD cross. Results showed that SHRSP increased FAD-dependent neuroinflammation (microglia and astrocytes) and tau pathology, but plaque pathology changes were subtle, including fewer plaques with compact cores and slightly reduced plaque burden. Evidence for vascular pathology included a change in the distribution of astrocytic end-foot protein aquaporin-4, normally distributed in microvessels, but in SHRSP/FAD rats largely dissociated from vessels, appearing disorganized or redistributed into neuropil. Other evidence of SVD-like pathology included increased collagen IV staining in cerebral vessels and PECAM1 levels. We identified a plasma biomarker in SHRSP/FAD rats that was the only group to show increased Aqp-4 in plasma exosomes. Evidence of neuron damage in SHRSP/FAD rats included increased caspase-cleaved actin, loss of myelin and reduced calbindin staining in neurons. Further, there were mitochondrial deficits specific to SHRSP/FAD, notably the loss of complex II, accompanying FAD-dependent loss of mitochondrial complex I. Cognitive deficits exhibited by FAD rats were not exacerbated by the introduction of the SHRSP phenotype, nor was the hyperactivity phenotype associated with SHRSP altered by the FAD transgene. This novel rat model of MxD, encompassing an amyloidogenic transgene with a hypertensive phenotype, exhibits several features associated with human vascular or 'mixed' dementia and may be a useful tool in delineating the pathophysiology of MxD and development of therapeutics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Denver, D’Adamo, Hu, Zuo, Zhu, Okuma, Kim, Castro, Jones, Leal, Mekkittikul, Ghadishah, Teter, Vinters, Cole and Frautschy.</CopyrightInformation>"}

They are considered the final effectors of any given immune response since they can be activated by a wide range of surface ligands and cytokines to acquire a continuum of functional states. Macrophages are involved in tissue homeostasis and in the promotion or resolution of inflammatory responses, causing tissue damage or helping in tissue repair. Knowledge in macrophage polarization has significantly increased in the last decade. Biomarkers, functions, and metabolic states associated with macrophage polarization status have been defined both in murine and human models. Moreover, a large body of evidence demonstrated that macrophage status is a dynamic process that can be modified. Macrophages orchestrate virtually all major diseases-sepsis, infection, chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), neurodegenerative disease, and cancer-and thus they represent attractive therapeutic targets. In fact, the possibility to 'reprogram' macrophage status is considered as a promising strategy for designing novel therapies. Here, we will review the role of different tissue macrophage populations in the instauration and progression of inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathologies, as exemplified by rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, glioblastoma, and tumor metastasis. We will analyze: 1) the potential as therapeutic targets of recently described macrophage populations, such as osteomacs, reported to play an important role in bone formation and homeostasis or metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs), key players in the generation of premetastatic niche; 2) the current and potential future approaches to target monocytes/macrophages and their inflammation-causing products in rheumatoid arthritis; and 3) the development of novel intervention strategies using oncolytic viruses, immunomodulatory agents, and checkpoint inhibitors aiming to boost M1-associated anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we will focus on the potential of macrophages as therapeutic targets and discuss their involvement in state-of-the-art strategies to modulate prevalent pathologies of aging societies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ardura, Rackov, Izquierdo, Alonso, Gortazar and Escribese.</CopyrightInformation>"}

To explore the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using the data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found CSF sTREM2 levels were elevated with the disease stages, but there was no significant difference between that of AD patients and normal participants. CSF sTREM2 was positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (ρ &gt; 0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 1e-06; ρ &gt; 0.32, <i>p</i> &lt; 1e-05, respectively) for all disease states.

Acute activation of the peripheral immune system, <i>via</i> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, elicits deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Little is known concerning the effect of chronic inflammation on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent vigilance. We examined the impact of repeated LPS injections in young and middle-age rats on the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), expecting repeated LPS treatment to induce attentional deficits with greater disruption in middle-age. <b>Methods</b>: Male Fischer-344 rats, 4- and 12-months-old, were food restricted and trained on the 5-CSRTT. Once rats reached criterion, they were injected with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) weekly for 4 weeks and testing started 48 h after each injection. To examine the possibility that mild food restriction inherent to the behavioral task influenced inflammation markers, a second group of food-restricted or <i>ad-lib</i>-fed rats was assessed for cytokine changes 48 h after one injection. <b>Results</b>: Performing LPS-treated rats exhibited a sickness response, manifesting as reduced initiated and completed trials during the first week but recovered by the second week of testing. After the first week, LPS-treated rats continued to exhibit longer response latencies, despite no change in food retrieval latency, suggestive of LPS-induced cognitive slowing. Similarly, LPS-induced impairment of attention was observed as increased omissions with heightened cognitive demand and increased age. Repeated LPS-treatment increased the level of PFC IL-1α, and PFC IL-6 was marginally higher in middle-age rats. No effect of age or treatment was observed for plasma cytokines in performing rats. Histological examination of microglia indicated increased colocalization of Iba1+ and CD68+ cells from middle-age relative to young rats. Examination of food restriction demonstrated an attenuation of age- and LPS-related increases in plasma cytokine levels. <b>Conclusions</b>: Systemic inflammation, induced through LPS treatment, impaired attentional function, which was independent of sickness and exacerbated by increased cognitive demand and increased age. Additional studies revealed that food restriction, associated with the task, attenuated markers of neuroinflammation and plasma cytokines. The results emphasize the need for improved methods for modeling low-level chronic systemic inflammation to effectively examine its impact on attention during aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Yegla and Foster.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Western blot analyses were used to validate the proteomic data. A total of 2,934 proteins were identified and analyzed. Twenty-two proteins were continuously downregulated with increasing age, while three proteins were continuously upregulated. When comparing Group C vs. Group B, 270 proteins were downregulated, while 73 proteins were upregulated. All these 368 significantly changed proteins were used for further analysis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the changed proteins were involved in several signaling pathways during cerebrovascular aging. Proteins in the NRF2 pathway, such as Glutathione S-transferase Mu (GSTM), were consistently downregulated especially after 6-years old, whereas proteins related to miRNA targets in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and membrane receptors were upregulated. Protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that disorders of energy pathways and serine/threonine kinases were critical during cerebrovascular aging.

Whether such findings represent a causal contribution or are the result of opportunistic messengers sent from the reproductive system to the brain is also a vital question. We constructed a multiscale network of the ovariectomy (OVX) induced estrogen receptors depletion (ER-depletion) model and integrated targeted proteomic, targeted lipidomic, cytochemical, and histopathological data across three tissues from the ovariectomy rodent model. We found that compared to control rats, OVX rats showed increased renal and uterine prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds) expression and decreased hypothalamic Ptgds expression, abnormal Ptgds metabolites, the degenerate renal function profiles and decreased cognitive ability (learning and memory) in Morris water maze test. Importantly, we observed a regulatory relationship among ER (particularly ERβ), the degree of the pathological phenotype, learning behavior test and the 'hypothalamus-uterus-kidney (HUK) axis functions. Collectively, this study elucidates that ER depletion promoted HUK aging is mostly attributed to a renal ERβ/Ptgds signalling imbalance.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we assess the response of immune cells to lactate in the context of chronic inflammation. We report that lactate accumulation in the inflamed tissue contributes to the upregulation of the lactate transporter SLC5A12 by human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. SLC5A12-mediated lactate uptake into CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induces a reshaping of their effector phenotype, resulting in increased IL17 production via nuclear PKM2/STAT3 and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. It also leads to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell retention in the inflamed tissue as a consequence of reduced glycolysis and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, antibody-mediated blockade of SLC5A12 ameliorates the disease severity in a murine model of arthritis. Finally, we propose that lactate/SLC5A12-induced metabolic reprogramming is a distinctive feature of lymphoid synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis patients and a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recently, it has also become clear that complement proteins have fundamental roles in the developing and aging CNS that are distinct from their roles in immunity. During neurodevelopment, complement signalling is involved in diverse processes including neural tube closure, neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation, neuronal migration, and synaptic pruning. In acute neurotrauma and ischamic brain injury, complement drives inflammation and neuronal death, but also neuroprotection and regeneration. In diseases of the aging CNS including dementias and motor neuron disease, chronic complement activation is associated with glial activation, and synapse and neuron loss. Proper regulation of complement is thus essential to allow for an appropriately developed CNS and prevention of excessive damage following neurotrauma or during neurodegeneration. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence for functional roles of complement in brain formation, and its dysregulation during acute and chronic disease. We also provide working models for how complement can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, and either protect, or propagate neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) increases substantially with age, in part due to clinically identified deterioration of PFM function with age. However, the etiology of this decline remains largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that PFMs undergo age-related fibrotic changes. This study sought to determine whether aging also impacts PFMs' passive mechanical properties that are largely determined by the intramuscular extracellular matrix. Biopsies from younger (≤52y) and older (&gt;52y) female cadaveric donors were procured from PFMs, specifically coccygeus (C) and two portions of the levator ani - iliococcygeus (IC) and pubovisceralis (PV), and the appendicular muscles - obturator internus (OI) and vastus lateralis (VL). Muscle bundles were subjected to a passive loading protocol, and stress-sarcomere length (L<sub>s</sub>) relationships calculated. Muscle stiffness was compared between groups using 2-way ANOVA and Sidak pairwise comparisons, α &lt; 0.05. The mean age was 43.4 ± 11.6y and 74.9 ± 11.9y in younger (N = 5) and older (N = 10) donors, respectively. In all PFMs, the quadratic coefficient of parabolic regression of the stress-L<sub>s</sub> curve, a measure of stiffness, was lower in the younger versus older group: C: 33.7 ± 13.9 vs 87.2 ± 10.7, P = 0.02; IC: 38.3 ± 12.7 vs 84.5 ± 13.9, P = 0.04; PV: 24.7 ± 8.8 vs 74.6 ± 9.6, P = 0.04. In contrast, non-PFM stiffness was not affected by aging: OI: 14.5 ± 4.7 vs 32.9 ± 6.2, P = 0.8 and VL: 13.6 ± 5.7 vs 30.1 ± 5.3, P = 0.9.

Married or cohabiting community-dwelling Israelis in the second half of life (N = 360) were interviewed and reported on their close social relationships, their level of loneliness, and their subjective age. The number of close social relationships was found to have a negative relationship with loneliness. Moreover, subjective age was found to moderate the relationship between close social relationships and loneliness, such that the association was weaker for those with older subjective age. Those with older subjective age are often not able to benefit from close social relationships to alleviate loneliness as much as their younger-subjective-age counterparts.

Hence, age-related changes in tendon matrix properties may alter sliding behavior and thereby affect injury thresholds. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of age on interfibrillar shear behavior in partial cut tendon fascicles. Cine microscopic imaging was used to track deformation patterns of intact and partial cut fascicles from mature (9 months, n = 10) and aged (32 months, n = 10) rat tail tendons. Finite element (FE) models coupled with experimental data provided insight into age-related changes in tissue constitutive properties that could give rise to age-dependent behavior. Intact fascicles from aged tendons exhibited a 28% lower linear region modulus and reduced toe region when compared to fascicles from mature tendons. Partial cut tendon fascicles consistently exhibited a shearing plane that extended longitudinally from the tip of the cut. Both mature and aged fascicles exhibited distinct failure that was observable in differential displacement across the shearing plane. However, aged fascicles exhibited 11-20% higher grip-to-grip strain at failure and tended to exhibit more variable and greater differential displacement at failure, when compared to mature fascicles. FE models suggest that this age-related change in shear behavior arises from a reduction in interfibrillar shear modulus with age. These data suggest that aging alters interfibrillar failure mechanisms and hence may contribute to the increased propensity for injury that is commonly seen in older tendons.</AbstractText>"}

Several attempts have been made to instead define a 'biological age' using multiple physiological parameters in order to account for variation in the trajectory of human aging; however, these methods require technical expertise and are likely too time-intensive and costly to be implemented into clinical practice. Accordingly, we sought to develop a metabolomic signature of biological aging that could predict changes in physiological function with the convenience of a blood sample. A weighted model of biological age was generated based on multiple clinical and physiological measures in a cohort of healthy adults and was then applied to a group of healthy older adults who were tracked longitudinally over a 5-10-year timeframe. Plasma metabolomic signatures were identified that were associated with biological age, including some that could predict whether individuals would age at a faster or slower rate. Metabolites most associated with the rate of biological aging included amino acid, fatty acid, acylcarnitine, sphingolipid, and nucleotide metabolites. These results not only have clinical implications by providing a simple blood-based assay of biological aging, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human healthspan.</AbstractText>"}

We identified 30 promising disability-associated polymorphisms in 19 loci at p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; four of them attained suggestive significance, p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>. In contrast, polygenic risk scores aggregating effects of minor alleles of independent SNPs that were adversely or beneficially associated with disability showed highly significant associations in meta-analysis, p = 3.13 × 10<sup>-45</sup> and p = 5.60 × 10<sup>-23</sup>, respectively, and were replicated in each study. The analysis of genetic pathways, related diseases, and biological functions supported the connections of genes for the identified SNPs with disabling and age-related conditions primarily through oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammatory response, and ciliary signaling. We identified musculoskeletal system development, maintenance, and regeneration as important components of gene functions. The beneficial and adverse gene sets may be differently implicated in the development of musculoskeletal-related disability with the beneficial set characterized, e.g., by regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and bone formation, and the adverse set by inflammation and bone loss.</AbstractText>"}

We found that mitochondrial proteins involved in the electron transport chain were overrepresented in cells from older participants, with prevalent dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and energy metabolism molecular pathways. Surprisingly, gene transcripts coding for mitochondrial proteins pertaining to oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport chain pathways were underrepresented in older individuals. Paralleling the observed decrease in gene expression, mitochondrial respiration was impaired in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from older subjects. Though mitochondrial number in both naïve and memory cells visualized with electron microcopy was similar in older versus younger participants, there were a significantly higher number of autophagosomes, many of them containing undegraded mitochondria, in older individuals. The presence of mitochondria inside the accumulated autophagic compartments in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from older individuals was confirmed by immunofluorescence. These findings suggest that older age is associated with persistence of dysfunctional mitochondria in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes caused by defective mitochondrial turnover by autophagy, which may trigger chronic inflammation and contribute to the impairment of immune defense in older persons.</AbstractText>"}

However, little is known about the contribution of innate susceptibility to stress to the deterioration of physiological functions, acceleration of aging and developing of age-related diseases. By using socially-submissive stress susceptible (Sub) and socially-dominant stress resilient (Dom) selectively bred mouse model we observed a marked reduction in the lifespan of both male and female Sub mice. We found that innate susceptibility to stress correlates with chronic inflammation, development of splenomegaly and a significant increase in the levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, Sub mice showed a marked hypoglycemia, reduction of insulin levels, increase in GSK3 activity and elevation of IGF-1 serum levels, as well as low skin surface temperature and body weight. Interestingly, lifelong exposure of Sub mice to chronic mild stress did not further reduce their lifespan, indicating a high level of intrinsic stress. Taken together, our data reveal that social submissiveness coupled with innate stress sensitivity coincides with inflammation, leading to the deterioration of physiological functions and early aging independent of whether an individual is exposed to stress or not.</AbstractText>"}

The results were similar when pack-years of smoking was used. The effect parameters did not differ significantly between race and sex groups.

To the best of our knowledge, there are only 18 cases reported in the literature including ours with spinal cord injury following elective non-spine surgery with undiagnosed CSM. Due to multifactorial pathophysiology, the maintenance of cervical cord neutrality is not sufficient to ensure that these patients will not sustain cord injury intraoperatively as this solely addresses the role of static factors. Vigilance to factors affecting cord perfusion and vascular compromise, such as the mean arterial pressure (MAP), is imperative. Additionally, further studies should evaluate the role of positioning in the myelopathic patient and whether the steep Trendelenburg position, commonly used in robotic surgeries, contributes to spinal cord venous congestion and resultant cord ischemia in these patients given their baseline stenotic canal.

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound found in grapes and red wine, could help to relieve metabolic syndrome dysregulation. Since the gut microbiota is known to be closely related to metabolic homeostasis, this study aimed to investigate the impact of a combination of maternal and postweaning HF diets on the gut microbiota and whether resveratrol could relieve the gut dysbiosis associated with metabolic dysregulation. Sprague-Dawley dams were sustained on either a chow or HF diet before mating, during pregnancy and during lactation. Their offspring were randomly fed chow or a HF diet after weaning. Four experimental groups were generated: CC (maternal/postnatal chow diet), HC (maternal HF/postnatal chow diet), CH (maternal chow/postnatal high-fat diet) and HH (maternal/postnatal HF diet). A fifth group consisted of HH with resveratrol treatment. We found that both maternal and postnatal HF exposure has a distinct effect on the gut microbiota metagenome of offspring. Maternal HF diet exposure decreased plasma acetate, propionate and butyrate level, while postnatal HF diet exposure decreased plasma acetate level in adult life. The metabolic dysregulation programed by the maternal and postnatal HF diets was related to the relevant gut microbiota. Resveratrol treatment ameliorated the altered plasma propionate level related to maternal HF and postnatal HF diet treatment. Resveratrol treatment also improved most of the altered metabolic dysregulation and related dysbiosis programmed by maternal and postnatal HF diet exposure.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, there is limited data on long-term changes in the membranes' performance as they age. The present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics for hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membranes that ranged in age from 8 full-scale drinking water treatment plants. Membranes were harvested by plant operators regularly and analyzed using standardized laboratory tests. Approximately half of the membranes were a new PVDF-based chemistry. These were observed to have insignificant changes in performance factors and chemical characteristics since their beginning of operation. However, because these membranes were newer, only data for the first 5 years of operation was available. The other half of the membranes, with an older PVDF-based chemistry, were observed to have stable behaviour until approximately 5 years of operation; after this time, performance factors and chemical characteristics of the membranes began to change significantly. For these membranes, the clean water resistance and fouling rate increased after 5 years of operation. The mechanical properties of these membranes also deteriorated after 5 years of operation, suggesting that their susceptibility to breach is higher after prolonged use. These changes in performance factors paralleled, and were possibly caused by, the removal of hydrophilic additives from the membrane material. Clean water resistance was identified as a good benchmark for all the parameters studied, a finding that is useful for water treatment facilities in quickly assessing the status of their membranes. Finally, although cumulative exposure dose (C*t) was not used as a metric of membrane age, we observed that when higher doses of hypochlorite were applied, all metrics changed faster than expected based only on years of operation. Therefore, limiting the magnitude of the cumulative hypochlorite dose is essential in managing membrane deterioration. This research illuminates the knowledge gap between bench-scale ageing studies and operational water treatment plants.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we investigated the effects of accelerated aging on characteristics, leaching, and toxicity of commercial lead chromate pigmented MPs. Results show that aging of MPs caused surface cracks and fragmentation, increased their surface area and carbonyl contents, and promoted the release of lead chromate pigment. Chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) tend to leach under acidic condition, rather than neutral and alkali environment. Aging treatment facilitates the leaching performance and a high concentration of NaCl solution also favors the leaching process. Toxicology experiments demonstrate that only high concentration of leachate (&gt;10 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) exerted significant inhibitory influence (p &lt; 0.005) on cell photosynthesis of Microcystis aeruginosa. The growth inhibition of algal cells remarkably increased with increasing leachate concentrations. We observed more inhibiting effects on cell growth and photosynthesis using the leachates of aged MPs. Longer aging time leads to more release of Cr and Pb, rendering higher toxicity to microalgae. These novel findings will benefit us from assessing the leaching behavior of additives in MPs and their toxicological risks to aquatic organisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of their challenging morphology, they usually need to be maintained for an organism's lifetime. This makes them key lesion sites in pathological processes of ageing, injury and neurodegeneration. The morphology and physiology of axons crucially depends on the parallel bundles of microtubules (MTs), running all along to serve as their structural backbones and highways for life-sustaining cargo transport and organelle dynamics. Understanding how these bundles are formed and then maintained will provide important explanations for axon biology and pathology. Currently, much is known about MTs and the proteins that bind and regulate them, but very little about how these factors functionally integrate to regulate axon biology. As an attempt to bridge between molecular mechanisms and their cellular relevance, we explain here the model of local axon homeostasis, based on our own experiments in Drosophila and published data primarily from vertebrates/mammals as well as C. elegans. The model proposes that (1) the physical forces imposed by motor protein-driven transport and dynamics in the confined axonal space, are a life-sustaining necessity, but pose a strong bias for MT bundles to become disorganised. (2) To counterbalance this risk, MT-binding and -regulating proteins of different classes work together to maintain and protect MT bundles as necessary transport highways. Loss of balance between these two fundamental processes can explain the development of axonopathies, in particular those linking to MT-regulating proteins, motors and transport defects. With this perspective in mind, we hope that more researchers incorporate MTs into their work, thus enhancing our chances of deciphering the complex regulatory networks that underpin axon biology and pathology.</AbstractText>"}

This holistic study has investigated the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS), anti-infection, antioxidant and anti-photoaging properties of neglected plant Diplocyclos palmatus. The results showed that D. palmatus methanolic leaf extract (DPME) effectively inhibited the quorum sensing (QS) regulated virulence factor production as well as biofilm formation in Serratia marcescens. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that DPME significantly downed the expression of QS-regulated genes such as fimA, fimC, flhC, bsmB, pigP and shlA in S. marcescens, which supports the outcome of in vitro bioassays. Further, the docking study revealed that the presence of active compounds, namely tocopherols and phytol, DPME exhibited its anti-QS activity against S. marcescens. In addition, DPME treatment extended the lifespan of S. marcescens infected C. elegans by the action of dropping the internal accumulation. Further, qPCR analysis clearly revealed that DPME treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of the lifespan-related gene (daf-16) and immune-related genes (clec-60, clec-87, lys-7 and bec-1) in S. marcescens infected C.elegans. On the other hand, DPME extensively reduced the UV-A induced ROS stress, thereby, extended the lifespan in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further, the qPCR analysis also confirmed the up-regulation of daf-16, clec-60, clec-87 and col-19 genes which advocated the improvement of the lifespan, healthspan and collagen production in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further bioassays evidenced that that the lifespan extension of photoaged C. elegans was accomplished by the actions of antioxidants such as tocopherols and phytol in DPME.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CR on spatial memory in aged Wistar rats, as well as on monoaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus (HPC). As such, animals maintained on different dietary regimes were trained in the Morris Water Maze (MWM): old rats (24-27 months) maintained on a 30% CR diet from four months of age, old rats (24-27 months) with unrestricted access to food (Ad Libitum); and adult rats (3-4 months) with Ad Libitum access to food. As well as their performance in the spatial memory task, monoamine levels, and NMDA and AMPA receptor subunit expression in the HPC were also assessed in these rats, as was the plasma corticosterone as a measure of the pituitary-adrenal response to stress. Accordingly, it appears that CR attenuates the spatial memory decline in aged rats and the age-associated decrease in the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA, as well as the expression of the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits in the HPC. In addition, CR augments the noradrenaline in this structure, although it did not modify the age-associated increase in plasma corticosterone levels. These findings support the positive effect of CR on spatial memory, suggesting that enhancing monoaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the HPC may help improve learning and memory in aged animals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While many advances have been made in the field of osteoporosis, current treatments have been affected by unexpected side effects and limited efficacy; therefore, new approaches to identify disease mechanisms and pathways are required. This review focuses on the influence of tryptophan metabolites, particularly kynurenines and serotonin on bone. The kynurenine (KYN) pathway is associated with osteoblastogenesis and can be linked to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The activity of osteoblasts is reduced by 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKYN), a product of KYN. In addition, decreasing concentrations of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid with aging can be one of the causes of bone loss. In contrast, picolinic acid, an end-product of the KYN pathway, acts as a bone anabolic. On the other hand, gut-derived serotonin (GDS) inhibits bone formation, whereas brain-derived serotonin enhances bone formation and decreases bone resorption. Overall, understanding the exact mechanisms of action of tryptophan metabolites on bone could have great potential to develop effective treatments for osteoporosis and other bone diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have identified structural and functional changes in the brain that contribute to older adults' speech perception difficulties. Yet, many of these studies use neuroimaging techniques that evaluate only gross activation in isolated brain regions. Neural oscillations may provide further insight into the processes underlying SIN perception as well as the interaction between auditory cortex and prefrontal linguistic brain regions that mediate complex behaviors. We examined frequency-specific neural oscillations and functional connectivity of the EEG in older adults with and without hearing loss during an active SIN perception task. Brain-behavior correlations revealed listeners who were more resistant to the detrimental effects of noise also demonstrated greater modulation of α phase coherence between clean and noise-degraded speech, suggesting α desynchronization reflects release from inhibition and more flexible allocation of neural resources. Additionally, we found top-down β connectivity between prefrontal and auditory cortices strengthened with poorer hearing thresholds despite minimal behavioral differences. This is consistent with the proposal that linguistic brain areas may be recruited to compensate for impoverished auditory inputs through increased top-down predictions to assist SIN perception. Overall, these results emphasize the importance of top-down signaling in low-frequency brain rhythms that help compensate for hearing-related declines and facilitate efficient SIN processing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

Recent empirical evidence demonstrates large differences in adult life history traits, especially longevity, among Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata; 'medfly') biotypes obtained from different regions of the world. However, whether the evolution of long lifespan is associated with response to stress induced by larval crowding has not been fully elucidated. We investigated, under constant laboratory conditions, the response of a short- and a long-lived medfly biotypes to stress induced by larval crowding. Survival and development of larvae and pupae and the size of resulting pupae were recorded. The lifespan and age-specific egg production patterns of the obtained adults were recorded. Our findings reveal that increased larval density reduced immature survival (larvae and pupae) in the short-lived biotype but had rather neutral effects on the longed-lived one. Only larvae of the long-lived biotype were capable of prolonging their developmental duration under the highest crowding regime to successfully pupate and emerge as adults. Response of emerging adults to larvae crowding conditions was similar in the two medfly biotypes. Those individuals emerging from high larval density regimes had reduced longevity and fecundity. Long-lived biotype individuals, however, appeared to suffer a higher cost in longevity compared with the short-lived one.

Psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia may be associated with accelerated cellular aging, indicated by shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which could underlie this connection. Telomere shortening occurs with repeated cell division and is reflective of a cell's mitotic history. It is also influenced by cumulative exposure to inflammation and oxidative stress as well as the availability of telomerase, the telomere-lengthening enzyme. Precariously short telomeres can cause cells to undergo senescence, apoptosis, or genomic instability; shorter LTL correlates with compromised general health and foretells mortality. Important data specify that LTL may be reduced in principal psychiatric illnesses, possibly in proportion to exposure to the ailment. Telomerase, as measured in peripheral blood monocytes, has been less well characterized in psychiatric illnesses, but a role in mood disorder has been suggested by preclinical and clinical studies. In this manuscript, the most recent studies on LTL and telomerase activity in mood disorders are comprehensively reviewed, potential mediators are discussed, and future directions are suggested. An enhanced comprehension of cellular aging in psychiatric illnesses could lead to their re-conceptualizing as systemic ailments with manifestations both inside and outside the brain.

The prevalence of sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle mass and strength, is increasing in the aging society. Recent studies reported the relationship between NAFLD and sarcopenia. The skeletal muscle is the primary organ for glucose disposal. Loss of muscle mass can cause insulin resistance, which is an important risk factor for NAFLD. Moreover, obesity, chronic low-grade inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, physical inactivity, hepatokines, and myokines might be involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism of sarcopenia and NAFLD. Although most of the previous studies have demonstrated the positive correlation between sarcopenia and NAFLD, the difference in diagnostic methods of sarcopenia and NAFLD leads to difficulties in interpretation and application. This review discusses the concept and diagnosis of sarcopenia and NAFLD, common pathophysiology, and clinical studies linking sarcopenia to NAFLD. The presentation of the association between sarcopenia and NAFLD may provide an opportunity to prevent the deterioration of fatty liver disease.</AbstractText>"}

International evidence demonstrates that cost-sharing for medicines may delay necessary care, increase use of other forms of healthcare and result in poorer health outcomes. Existing studies concentrate on adults and older people, particularly in the US, with relatively less attention afforded to paediatric and European populations. In Ireland, prescription drug co-payments were introduced for the first time for medical cardholders (i.e. those with public health insurance) in October 2010, initially at a cost of €0.50 per item, rising to €1.50 in January 2013, and further increasing to €2.50 in December 2013. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study of children, and a difference-in-difference research design, we estimate the impact of the introduction (and increase) of these co-payments on health, healthcare utilisation and household financial wellbeing. The introduction of modest co-payments on prescription items was not estimated to impinge on the health of children and parents from low-income families. For the younger Infant Cohort, difference-in-difference estimates indicated that the introduction (and increase) in co-payments was associated with a decrease in GP visits and hospital nights, and a decrease in the proportion of households reporting 'difficulties with making ends meet'. In contrast, for the older cohort of children (the Child Cohort), co-payments were associated with an increase in GP visiting, and an increase in household deprivation. While the parallel trends assumption for difference-in-difference analysis appeared to be satisfied, further investigation revealed that there were other time-varying observable factors (such as exposure to the economic recession over the period) that affected the treatment and control groups, as well as the two cohorts of children differentially, that may partly explain these divergent results. For example, while the analysis suggests that the introduction of the €0.50 co-payment in 2010 was associated with an increase in the probability of treated families in the Child Cohort being deprived by 9.4 percentage points, the proportion of treated families experiencing unemployment and reductions in household income also increased significantly around the time of the co-payment introduction. This highlights the difficulty in identifying the effect of the co-payment policy in an environment in which assignment to the treatment (i.e. medical cardholder status) was not randomly assigned.</AbstractText>"}

With volume fractions greater than 0.02 they are stacked into tactoids of few layers with a repeat distance in the order of 10 nm. The tactoids align into nematic liquid crystalline phases with irregularly wide interstices of empty liquid. Colloidal processing involves the freeze-drying of such anisotropic fluids and the dispersion of the restacked tacoids into aqueous dispersions of colloidal polymer particles of largely varying size which occupy the otherwise empty liquid between the α-ZrP tactoids and induce piling of the tactoids into columns. Real-time SAXS on drying films and TEM of the obtained coatings demonstrate that the stacked α-ZrP platelets and the polymer particles comprising liquid dry separately without polymer intercalation, while the morphology of the obtained composites can be tuned primarily by the size of the polymer colloids. Concomitant α-ZrP hydrolysis in the exfoliation step is scrutinized as a function of amine basicity and temperature. The role of zirconium based hydrolysis products in the hierarchical α-ZrP assembly is indirectly though consistently confirmed by opposing impacts of ultra-filtration and added oxoanions on the platelets' spacing, smoothness and aggregation. HAADF-TEM imaging of scattered, singular platelets and XRD peak analysis of the pristine solid shed light on the α-ZrP synthesis. Coexisting flakes and lacunae, both similar in size to the intra-layer crystal domains, suggest the stitching of proto-α-ZrP flakes into extended layers in accordance with our observations on the aging behaviour of α-ZrP dispersions as well as with literature data on related systems.</AbstractText>"}

Cav2.3 transcripts were more abundant than other voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in mouse nigral neurons and upregulated during aging. Plasmalemmal Cav2.3 protein was higher than in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, which do not degenerate in Parkinson's disease. Cav2.3 knockout reduced activity-associated nigral somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent after-hyperpolarizations, and afforded full protection from degeneration in vivo in a neurotoxin Parkinson's mouse model. Cav2.3 deficiency upregulated transcripts for NCS-1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein implicated in neuroprotection. Conversely, NCS-1 knockout exacerbated nigral neurodegeneration and downregulated Cav2.3. Moreover, NCS-1 levels were reduced in a human iPSC-model of familial Parkinson's.

We previously reported a difference in hermaphrodite lifespan between two wild-type lines widely used by C. elegans researchers (N2 hermaphrodite and male stocks). Here, using pathology-based approaches and genome sequencing, we identify the cause of this difference as a nonsense mutation in the filamin gene fln-2 in the male stock, which reduces early mortality caused by pharyngeal infection. We show how fln-2 variation explains previous discrepancies involving effects of sir-2.1 (sirtuin deacetylase) on ageing, and show that in a fln-2(+) background, sir-2.1 over-expression causes an FUDR (DNA synthesis inhibitor)-dependent reduction in pharyngeal infection and increase in lifespan. In addition we show how fln-2 variation confounds effects on lifespan of daf-2 (insulin/IGF-1 signalling), daf-12 (steroid hormone signalling), and eat-2 (putative dietary restriction).

Accumulating evidence suggest that senescence of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) perpetuates aging or age-related diseases.

Suppression of KDM3A or KDM4C by either genetic or biochemical approach leads to robust DNA damage response and aggravates cellular senescence, whereas overexpression of KDM3A/KDM4C or NCAPD2 promotes heterochromatin reorganization and blunts DNA damage response. Moreover, MSCs derived from Kdm3a-/- mice exhibit defective chromosome organization and exacerbated DNA damage response, which are associated with accelerated bone aging. Consistently, analysis of human bone marrow MSCs and transcriptome database reveals inverse correlation of KDM3A/KDM4C and/or NCAPD2/NCAPG2 with aging.

This has been associated with the aging of stem cell populations within the body that decreases the capacity of stem cells to self-renew, differentiate, and regenerate damaged tissues and organs. This review aims to explore how aging is associated with the dysregulation of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (SCEVs) and their corresponding miRNA cargo (SCEV-miRNAs), which are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. Recent evidence has suggested that in aging stem cells, SCEV-miRNAs may play a vital role regulating various processes that contribute to aging: cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, telomere length, and circadian rhythm. Hence, further clarifying the age-dependent molecular mechanisms through which SCEV-miRNAs exert their downstream effects may inform a greater understanding of the biology of aging, elucidate their role in stem cell function, and identify important targets for future regenerative therapies. Additionally, current studies evaluating therapeutic role of SCEVs and SCEV-miRNAs in treating several age-associated diseases are also discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the ocular lens is an excellent model for studying long-lived proteins (LLPs) and the effects of aging and post-translational modifications on protein structure and function. Given the architecture of the lens, with young fiber cells in the outer cortex and the oldest cells in the lens nucleus, spatially-resolved studies provide information on age-specific protein changes. In this review, experimental strategies and proteomic methods that have been used to examine age-related and cataract-specific changes to the human lens proteome are described. Measured spatio-temporal changes in the human lens proteome are summarized and reveal a highly consistent, time-dependent set of modifications observed in transparent human lenses. Such measurements have led to the discovery of cataract-specific modifications and the realization that many animal systems are unsuitable to study many of these modifications. Mechanisms of protein modifications such as deamidation, racemization, truncation, and protein-protein crosslinking are presented and the implications of such mechanisms for other long-lived proteins in other tissues are discussed in the context of age-related neurological diseases.

This suggests that young and older adults use episodic details differently to calibrate their vividness judgements. Capitalizing on the idea that remembering reactivates brain regions that initially processed details at encoding, the current fMRI study sought to examine these age-related changes in the basis of vivid recollection. At encoding, young and older adults saw pictures associated with labels and these labels were then used as retrieval cues for recalling the associated pictures and making memory vividness judgments. Results showed that highly vivid memories were associated with greater activity in the precuneus in young than older adults. Furthermore, the direct comparison between encoding and retrieval patterns of activity using Representational Similarity Analyses revealed stronger item-specific reactivation in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex in young than older adults. Taken together, these results provide new evidence that aging is associated with reduced reinstatement of activity in brain regions that processed the encoding of complex stimuli, but older individuals judge these impoverished memory representations as subjectively vivid.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

From age 20 to 60, CBF is estimated to dip about 16% and continues to drop at a rate of 0.4%/year. This CBF dip will slowly reduce oxygen/glucose delivery to brain thus lowering ATP energy production needed by brain cells to perform normal activities. Reduced ATP production from mitochondrial loss or damage in the wear-and-tear of aging worsens when vascular risk factors (VRF) to Alzheimer's disease develop that can accelerate both age-decline CBF and mitochondrial deficiency to a level where mild cognitive impairment (MCI) develops. To date, no pharmacological or any other treatment has been successful in reversing, stabilizing or delaying MCI. For the first time in medical interventions, a non-pharmacological, non-invasive, well-tolerated, easy to perform, free of significant side effects and cost-effective treatment may achieve what virtually all AD treatments in the past have been unable to accomplish. This intervention uses transcranial infrared brain stimulation (TIBS), a form of photobiomodulation (PBM). PBM is a bioenergetic non-ionizing, therapeutic approach using low level light emission from laser or light emitting diodes. PBM has been used in a number of neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, depression, traumatic brain injury, and stroke with diverse reported benefits.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the progression of diabetic nephropathy in GK rats remain unclear. Kidneys from 15-week old male diabetic GK/Jcl rats and age-matched Wistar rats, which have the same genetic background as GK rats, were used. Proteomic analyses of GK and Wistar kidneys were performed using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed proteins in GK rats were subjected to pathway analysis, and expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and fumarate accumulation in GK kidneys were examined. Azan staining and immunohistochemical staining of α-smooth muscle actin were performed in relation to fibrosis in GK kidneys. Proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE, analysis of fumarate content, and expression analysis of HIF-1α, TGF-β1, and α-smooth muscle actin of GK rat's kidney, suggested the mechanism of fibrosis characterized as two stages in diabetic nephropathy of GK rats. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism such as elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and reduction of fumarate hydratase caused the accumulation of fumarate followed by the upregulation of HIF-1α and TGF-β1 leading to fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy. Alterations in proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle are associated with fibrosis through fumarate accumulation in diabetic nephropathy of GK rats.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This information could be used for the prediction of complex traits such as survival, which can in turn be used in replacement heifer management. In this study, we investigated which gEBV and phenotypic variables are of use in the prediction of survival. Survival was defined as survival to second lactation, plus 2 wk, a binary trait. A data set was obtained of 6,847 heifers that were all genotyped at birth. Each heifer had 50 gEBV and up to 62 phenotypic variables that became gradually available over time. Stepwise variable selection on 70% of the data was used to create multiple regression models to predict survival with data available at 5 decision moments: distinct points in the life of a heifer at which new phenotypic information becomes available. The remaining 30% of the data were kept apart to investigate predictive performance of the models on independent data. A combination of gEBV and phenotypic variables always resulted in the model with the highest Akaike information criterion value. The gEBV selected were longevity, feet and leg score, exterior score, udder score, and udder health score. Phenotypic variables on fertility, age at first calving, and milk quantity were important once available. It was impossible to predict individual survival accurately, but the mean predicted probability of survival of the surviving heifers was always higher than the mean predicted probability of the nonsurviving group (difference ranged from 0.014 to 0.028). The model obtained 2.0 to 3.0% more surviving heifers when the highest scoring 50% of heifers were selected compared with randomly selected heifers. Combining phenotypic information and gEBV always resulted in the highest scoring models for the prediction of survival, and especially improved early predictive performance. By selecting the heifers with the highest predicted probability of survival, increased survival could be realized at the population level in practice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>The Authors.

Examples of sex-specific differences include: (i) the relatively poor control of influenza virus infections in males compared to females, (ii) allergic asthma, an IgE-associated hypersensitivity reaction that is exacerbated in adolescent females compared to males, and (iii) systemic lupus erythematosus, a life-threatening autoimmune disease with a 9:1 female:male bias. Here we consider how estrogen and estrogen receptor α (ERα) may influence the immune response by modifying class switch recombination (CSR) and immunoglobulin expression patterns. We focus on ERα binding to enhancers (Eμ and the 3' regulatory region) and switch sites (Sµ and Sε) in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Our preliminary data from ChIP-seq analyses of purified, activated B cells show estrogen-mediated changes in the positioning of ERα binding within and near Sµ and Sε. In the presence of estrogen, ERα is bound not only to estrogen response elements (ERE), but also to adenosine-cytidine (AC)-repeats and poly adenosine (poly A) sequences, in some cases within constant region gene introns. We propose that by binding these sites, estrogen and ERα directly participate in the DNA loop formation required for CSR. We further suggest that estrogen regulates immunoglobulin expression patterns and can thereby influence life-and-death outcomes of infection, hypersensitivity, and autoimmune disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here I build on my recent finding that slower life histories universally accompany increased numbers of cortical neurons across warm-blooded species to propose a simpler framework for human evolution: that slower development to sexual maturity and increased post-maturity longevity are features that do not require selection, but rather inevitably and immediately accompany evolutionary increases in numbers of cortical neurons, thus fostering human social interactions and cultural and technological evolution as generational overlap increases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Iba1 and P2RY12 showed significant positive correlations with Aβ in controls but not in the AD or iAD groups.

The 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10) seems suitable for aging research owing to its low participant burden; however, its psychometric properties have not been comprehensively reported for older people. For example, no estimate exists of the test-retest reliability of the scale when used with older adults. Hence, this study evaluated the psychometric properties of the CD-RISC10 in a large population-based sample of community-dwelling older people.<b>Method:</b> The scale's internal consistency, factor structure, construct validity, test-retest reliability, and user experience were analyzed among 1018 Finnish older adults (57% women) aged 75 (45%), 80 (33%) and 85 years (22%).<b>Results:</b> The internal consistency of the CD-RISC10 was good (Cronbach's α = 0.85), test-retest reliability moderate (ICC = 0.61), and the scale was unidimensional. However, a two-factor solution was found among the 75-year-olds, where the ability to deal positively with change (e.g. using humor) explained an additional part of resilience. While no differences by gender, age, or education were observed in total scores, very good perceived financial situation was associated with higher resilience. The scale showed good construct validity, and user feedback indicated that administering the scale in research is quick and easy.<b>Conclusion:</b> In general, the CD-RISC10 is a valid method to study older adults' psychological resilience. However, the present test-retest reliability values suggest caution in using the scale as an outcome measure in intervention studies.</AbstractText>"}

The debate over the types of motions thought to occur in or on SiO<sub>2</sub> glass well below the glass transition temperature continues. Here, we form glassy silica films by oxidizing the Si(100) surface (from 0.5 to 1.5 nm thick, to allow tunneling). We then employ scanning tunneling microscopy in situ to image and classify these motions at room temperature on a millisecond to hour time scale and 50-pm to 5-nm length scale. We observe two phenomena on different time scales. Within minutes, compact clusters with an average diameter of several SiO<sub>2</sub> glass-forming units (GFUs) hop between a few (mostly two) configurations, hop cooperatively (facilitation), and merge into larger clusters (aging) or split into smaller clusters (rejuvenation). Within seconds, Si-O-Si bridges connect two GFUs within a single cluster flip, providing a vibrational fine structure to the energy landscape. We assign the vibrational fine structure using electronic structure calculations. Calculations also show that our measured barrier height for whole cluster hopping at the glass surface (configurational dynamics) is consistent with the configurational entropy predicted by thermodynamic models of the glass transition and that the vibrational entropy for GFU flipping and configurational entropy for cluster hopping are comparable (on a per GFU basis).</AbstractText>"}

This paper examines whether empirically derived procedures predict progression from MCI to dementia. (2) Methods: At baseline, 192 participants with SCC were diagnosed according to clinical criteria as cognitively unimpaired (70), single-domain amnestic MCI (65), multiple-domain amnestic MCI (33) and multiple-domain non-amnestic MCI (24). A two-stage hierarchical cluster analysis was performed for empirical classification. Categorical regression analysis was then used to assess the predictive value of the clusters obtained. Participants were re-assessed after 36 months.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a lipid-derived signaling molecule produced from arachidonic acid by cyclo-oxygenase, inhibits collagen production, and induces matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) expression by fibroblasts in vitro. PGE2-induced collagen expression inhibition and MMP1 promotion are aging mechanisms. This study investigated the role of E-prostanoid 1 (EP1) in PGE2 signaling in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). When EP1 expression was inhibited by EP1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), there were no significant changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of collagen, type I, alpha 1 (COL1A1)/MMP1 between siRNA-transfected NHDFs and siRNA-transfected NHDFs with PGE2. This result showed that EP1 is a PGE2 receptor. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation after PGE2 treatment significantly increased by ~2.5 times. In addition, PGE2 treatment increased the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in NHDFs.

This study investigates the association between PEF and prevalent and incident frailty in older adults. Data come from 2559 community-dwelling participants (age ≥ 60 years) of the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K). Baseline PEF was expressed as standardized residual (SR) percentiles. Frailty was assessed at baseline and over six years, according to the Fried criteria. Associations between PEF and frailty were estimated cross-sectionally through logistic regressions, and longitudinally by multinomial logistic regression, considering death as alternative outcome. Obstructive respiratory diseases and smoking habits were treated as potential effect modifiers. Our cross-sectional results showed that the 10th-49th and &lt;10th PEF SR percentile categories were associated with three- and five-fold higher likelihood of being frail than the 80th-100th category. Similar estimates were confirmed longitudinally, i.e., adjusted OR = 3.11 (95% CI: 1.61-6.01) for PEF SR percentiles &lt; 10th, compared with 80th-100th percentiles. Associations were enounced in participants without physical deficits, and tended to be stronger among those with baseline obstructive respiratory diseases, and, longitudinally, also among former/current smokers. These findings suggest that PEF is a marker of general robustness in older adults, and its reduction exceeding that expected by age is associated with frailty development.</AbstractText>"}

Endogenous and exogenous factors are involved in triggering this complex and multifactorial disease, whose hallmark is Amyloid-β (Aβ), formed by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretase. While there is no definitive cure for AD to date, many neuroprotective natural products, such as polyphenol and carotenoid compounds, have shown promising preventive activity, as well as helping in slowing down disease progression. In this article, we focus on the chemistry as well as structure of carotenoid compounds and their neuroprotective activity against Aβ aggregation using molecular docking analysis. In addition to examining the most prevalent anti-amyloidogenic carotenoid lutein, we studied cryptocapsin, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, and the apocarotenoid bixin. Our computational structure-based drug design analysis and molecular docking simulation revealed important interactions between carotenoids and Aβ via hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, and shows that carotenoids are powerful anti-amyloidogenic molecules with a potential role in preventing AD, especially since most of them can cross the blood-brain barrier and are considered nutraceutical compounds. Our studies thus illuminate mechanistic insights on how carotenoids inhibit Aβ aggregation. The potential role of carotenoids as novel therapeutic molecules in treating AD and other neurodegenerative disorders are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The appropriate amount of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs can act as effective heterogeneous nucleation centers, leading to the formation of smooth and pinhole-free perovskite films with increased grain size.

Dopaminergic axons directly innervate hippocampus and release dopamine in the local environment of hippocampus, and hence are directly involved in the modulation of hippocampal-dependent functions. Studies have explored the potential effect of dopamine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, it is not well defined whether oxidative damage and inflammation could be associated with alteration in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and how it is associated with inflammatory conditions in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease-like phenotypes. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced dopaminergic neurons and dopamine content that resulted in impairment of motor functions. Interestingly, the formation of endogenous neuronal precursor cells and the number of neuroblasts in the hippocampus were significantly increased following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. Net hippocampal neurogenesis was also reduced in the hippocampus after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. These effects in the hippocampus were associated with increased oxidative stress markers and a massive reactive gliosis. Taken together, our results suggest that degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons directly affects the local hippocampal microenvironment by enhancing inflammatory influences. The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus may alter the endogenous regenerative capacity of the brain. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents could be a potential therapy for the improvement of the endogenous regenerative capacity of the aging or neurodegenerative brain.</AbstractText>"}

This survey was used during week 1 (pre) and week 15 (post) of the semester to evaluate students' preparation and confidence to perform key QSEN competencies. Significant improvements (p &lt; .000) between pre/post scores on the Quality and Safety Survey were found across five classes. Students felt more prepared and confident to apply selected QSEN competencies on course completion. Moreover, nearly 60% (primary care) and nearly 35% (acute care) adult-gerontology APRN students selected the older adult population for their DNP projects. The Quality and Safety for the Aging Adult course positively influenced five classes of adult-gerontology APRN-DNP students. Integrating QSEN competencies with gerontology and quality/safety content is an effective strategy to prepare APRNs to lead quality/safety initiatives in aging adults. This innovative online course offers a successful model for innovative DNP education of adult-gerontology APRNs.</AbstractText>"}

This number is projected to become triple by 2050. AD is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative condition, characterized by complex pathology including oxidative stress, formation of aggregates of amyloid and tau, enhanced immune responses, metal deposition and disturbances in cholinesterase enzymes. There is no effective pharmacological treatment for combating the disease till date. The ineffectiveness of current pharmacological interventions in AD has led scientists to search for more safe and effective alternative therapeutic agents. Thus, natural products have become an important avenue for drug discovery in AD research. In this connection, polyphenols are natural products that have been shown to be effective in the modulation of the type of neurodegenerative changes seen in AD, suggesting a possible therapeutic role. The present review focuses on the chemistry of polyphenols, clinical studies for evaluating polyphenols as effective alternatives in AD treatment, cellular and molecular aspects of polyphenols in improving cognitive deficits and the current challenges and futuristic approaches to use polyphenols as safe and effective therapeutic agents in AD treatment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The development of tools for early diagnosis is one of the responses to this problem (2). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the main repository of by-products of neuronal destruction (3); as serial lumbar punctures to procure CSF may be impractical in advanced patients (4), blood may represent the ideal source to track any meaningful disease signal of neurodegeneration.High-costs and low energy efficiency have pushed alternative means of samples collection and storage. Noviplex dried plasma spot (Np-DPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) on filter paper can be a remote, quick and inexpensive way of obtaining blood microsamples for the measurement of a large number of analytes in non-hospitalized, public health settings (5).We have used commercially-available and highly sensitive immunodetection assays (6) to test neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) expression in elute from DBS and from Np-DPS and compared these to standard Nf-L plasma measurement of healthy controls and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).We show that DBS and Np-DP cards can be used for remote blood collection and measurement of Nf-L. Nf-L measurement using elute from Noviplex DPS cards is equivalent to that obtained in plasma from the same blood samples, while levels of the same analyte in DBS elute are different, but provide discrimination between controls and ALS patients. Normalization using known loading protein concentration may also be needed for DBS analysis to adjust for the chromatographic effect of retained haemoglobin in the spot elute. Conversely, a simple elution step is required for Np-DPS, which reconstitutes a test fluid which is indistinguishable from plasma originated by conventional blood processing.</AbstractText>"}

Wistar rats were grouped as: female rats from high estradiol to heat period (non-OVx) and ovariectomized (OVx) female rats. Ovariectomy was carried out 10 days before BD. BD was induced using intracranial balloon rapid inflation. Serum hormones and inflammatory mediators were quantified, leukocytes and platelets counted and lung samples were collected for RT-PCR, immunohistochemical, and histological analysis. Female sex hormones and corticosterone were reduced 6 h after BD in non-OVx group. The infiltration of leukocytes in female non-OVx lungs was higher compared to OVx. G-CSF, VEGF, and CINC-1 were found increased in non-OVx group serum in comparison to OVx. Lung mediators were increased in non-OVx rats compared to controls.

Failure of this process leads to accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins, ER stress, and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex signalling pathway aimed at restoring ER homeostasis, whose failure eventually leads to cell death. SIL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor for BiP, the main ER chaperone and primary sensor of ER stress. Loss of SIL1 function causes Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS), a rare multisystem disease of early infancy for which there is no cure. This review, examines the current understanding of SIL1 activities in the ER, and reviews experimental data describing the consequences of SIL1 deficiency in cell and animal models.

At advanced ages, however, people experience chronic disabilities, which significantly increase the social and economic burden while curtailing survival, independence, and quality of life of the aging population. As aging is a multifactorial process, apart from genetic predisposition, other environmental factors, such as chronic sterile inflammation and cellular senescence, contribute as crucial participants and have been targeted to reverse their deleterious effects on tissue homeostasis and functional integrity. Cellular senescence refers to the essentially irreversible inhibition of cellular proliferation when cells are subjected to extrinsic or endogenous stress. Although the process of cellular senescence has long been known, recent evidence demonstrated that it characterizes many aging phenotypes and that elimination of senescent cells at the tissue level can improve age-related tissue dysfunction. These observations have renewed scientific interest in possible therapeutic interventions. Two major chronic diseases associated with aging that impose an enormous burden on global health systems are type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. This review presents current data on (i) the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence, (ii) its relationship to these two endocrine diseases that are today prevalent worldwide, and (iii) future prospects of targeted intervention with the aim of simultaneously improving the progression and prognosis of these serious problems of aging.</AbstractText>"}

Currently, no effective treatment is available for AD. Although andrographolide (ANDRO), a compound extracted from the herb Andrographis paniculata, has shown interesting effects in models of several diseases, including AD, its effects on other molecular changes observed in AD, such as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, have not yet been studied. To evaluate the impact of ANDRO-based intervention on the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the brains of aged Octodon degus, a Chilean rodent, fifty-six-month-old O. degus were treated intraperitoneally with 2 or 4 mg/kg ANDRO. Vehicle-injected and 12-month-old O. degus were used as positive controls. Then, the protein levels of selected markers were assessed via immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. ANDRO significantly reduced the total Aβ burden as well as astrogliosis and interleukin-6 levels. Moreover, ANDRO significantly reduced the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal and N-tyrosine adducts, suggesting a relevant reduction in oxidative stress within aged O. degus brain. Considering that O. degus has been proposed as a potential 'natural' model for sporadic AD due to the development of neuropathological markers that resemble this pathology, our results suggest that ANDRO should be further studied to establish its potential as a therapeutic drug for AD.</AbstractText>"}

To model the thermal impact that took place in the year 79 AD, nine wall painting fragments recovered in the archeological site of Pompeii and which include yellow ochre pigment were subjected to thermal ageing experiments (exposition to temperatures from 200 to 400 °C every 25 °C). Before the experiments, elemental information of the fragments was obtained by micro-energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (μ-ED-XRF). The fragments were characterized before and after the exposition using Raman microscopy to monitor the transformation degree from yellow to red. The quantitative Raman imaging methodology was developed and validated using synthetic pellets of goethite and hematite standards. The results showed almost no transformation (0.5% ± 0.4) at 200 °C.

Examination of the clonal composition of an individual tumor and its evolution through disease progression and treatment may enable identification of precise therapeutic targets for drug design. Multi-region and single-cell sequencing are powerful tools that can be used to capture intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we present a database we've named CancerTracer (http://cailab.labshare.cn/cancertracer): a manually curated database designed to track and characterize the evolutionary trajectories of tumor growth in individual patients. We collected over 6000 tumor samples from 1548 patients corresponding to 45 different types of cancer. Patient-specific tumor phylogenetic trees were constructed based on somatic mutations or copy number alterations identified in multiple biopsies. Using the structured heterogeneity data, researchers can identify common driver events shared by all tumor regions, and the heterogeneous somatic events present in different regions of a tumor of interest. The database can also be used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between primary and metastatic tumors. It is our hope that CancerTracer will significantly improve our understanding of the evolutionary histories of tumors, and may facilitate the identification of predictive biomarkers for personalized cancer therapies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

One technique to characterize gene expression with tissue-specificity in whole organisms is single-molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (smFISH). However, this protocol requires lengthy incubation times, and it is challenging to achieve multiplexed smFISH in a whole organism. Multiplexing techniques can yield transcriptome-level information, but they require sequential probing of different genes. The inefficient macromolecule exchange through diffusion-dominant transport across dense tissues is the major bottleneck. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a microfluidic/electrokinetic hybrid platform to enable multicycle smFISH in an intact model organism, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We integrate an ion concentration polarization based ion pump with a microfluidic array to rapidly deliver and remove gene-specific probes and stripping reagents on demand in individual animals. Using our platform, we can achieve rapid smFISH, an order of magnitude faster than traditional smFISH protocols. We also demonstrate the capability to perform multicycle smFISH on the same individual samples, which is impossible to do off-chip. Our method hence provides a powerful tool to study individual-specific, spatially resolvable, and large-scale gene expression in whole organisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

The PVT1 expression in BMSC-derived exosomes was markedly higher than that in osteosarcoma cell-derived exosomes. The co-culturing of BMSC-derived exosomes and osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2, MG-63, and MNNG/HOS cell lines) significantly raised PVT1 expression of osteosarcoma cells. The direct binding between PVT1 and the oncogenic protein ERG was confirmed using RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays, and the transported PVT1 promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration via inhibiting degradation and ubiquitination of ERG. PVT1 also increased ERG expression through sponging miR-183-5p. In summary, our findings indicated that BMSC-derived exosomes encapsulate PVTl and transport it into osteosarcoma cells, and the transported PVT1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting ubiquitination and promoting expression of ERG in osteosarcoma cells.

We further show that Pax3 levels are controlled by alternative polyadenylation of its transcript, which is regulated by the small nucleolar RNA U1. Isoforms of the Pax3 messenger RNA that differ in their 3' untranslated regions are differentially susceptible to regulation by microRNA miR206, which results in varying levels of the Pax3 protein in vivo.

Some synapses are more vulnerable than others, including the synapses of the perforant path, which provides the main excitatory input to the hippocampus. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of these synapses, we performed an explorative proteomic study of the dentate terminal zone of the perforant path. The outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where the perforant path synapses are located, was microdissected from five subjects with AD and five controls. The microdissected tissues were dissolved and digested by trypsin. Peptides from each sample were labeled with different isobaric tags, pooled together and pre-fractionated into 72 fractions by high-resolution isoelectric focusing. Each fraction was then analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We quantified the relative expression levels of 7322 proteins, whereof 724 showed significantly altered levels in AD. Our comprehensive data analysis using enrichment and pathway analyses strongly indicated that presynaptic signaling, such as exocytosis and synaptic vesicle cycle processes, is severely disturbed in this area in AD, whereas postsynaptic proteins remained unchanged. Among the significantly altered proteins, we selected three of the most downregulated synaptic proteins; complexin-1, complexin-2 and synaptogyrin-1, for further validation, using a new cohort consisting of six AD and eight control cases. Semi-quantitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining confirmed decreased levels of complexin-1, complexin-2 and synaptogyrin-1 in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in AD. Our in-depth proteomic analysis provides extensive knowledge on the potential molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunction related to AD and supports that presynaptic alterations are more important than postsynaptic changes in early stages of the disease. The specific synaptic proteins identified could potentially be targeted to halt synaptic dysfunction in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 Haytural et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The mechanism for BLamDs accumulating between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and its basal lamina remains elusive. Here we examined the role in AMD of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2), a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in lysosomal biogenesis and maturation of autophagosomes/phagosomes. LAMP2 was preferentially expressed by RPE cells, and its expression declined with age. Deletion of the <i>Lamp2</i> gene in mice resulted in age-dependent autofluorescence abnormalities of the fundus, thickening of Bruch's membrane, and the formation of BLamDs, resembling histopathological changes occurring in AMD. Moreover, LAMP2-deficient mice developed molecular signatures similar to those found in human AMD-namely, the accumulation of APOE, APOA1, clusterin, and vitronectin-adjacent to BLamDs. In contrast, collagen 4, laminin, and fibronectin, which are extracellular matrix proteins constituting RPE basal lamina and Bruch's membrane were reduced in <i>Lamp2</i> knockout (KO) mice. Mechanistically, retarded phagocytic degradation of photoreceptor outer segments compromised lysosomal degradation and increased exocytosis in LAMP2-deficient RPE cells. The accumulation of BLamDs observed in LAMP2-deficient mice was eventually followed by loss of the RPE and photoreceptors. Finally, we observed loss of LAMP2 expression along with ultramicroscopic features of abnormal phagocytosis and exocytosis in eyes from AMD patients but not from control individuals. Taken together, these results indicate an important role for LAMP2 in RPE function in health and disease, suggesting that LAMP2 reduction may contribute to the formation of BLamDs in AMD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

A shared target of miR-17∼92 miRNAs is the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, central to life-death decisions in mammalian cells. To clarify the contribution of miR-17∼92:Bim interactions to the complex miR-17∼92 knockout phenotype, we used a system of conditional mutagenesis of the nine <i>Bim</i> 3' UTR miR-17∼92 seed matches. Blocking miR-17∼92:Bim interactions early in development phenocopied the lethal lung phenotype of miR-17∼92 ablation and generated a skeletal kinky tail. In the hematopoietic system, instead of causing the predicted B cell developmental block, it produced a selective inability of B cells to resist cellular stress; and prevented B and T cell hyperplasia caused by <i>Bim</i> haploinsufficiency. Thus, the interaction of miR-17∼92 with a single target is essential for life, and BIM regulation by miRNAs serves as a rheostat controlling cell survival in specific physiological contexts.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Labi et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The purpose of this paper was to systematically review all published WHI articles examining sleep as a predictor of health outcomes and health behaviors/quality of life outcomes. A strength of the WHI is that for most participants, sleep measures were completed before a major health diagnosis, with a significant portion of participants also providing sleep measures after diagnosis. Twenty-three WHI articles were identified and examined for this review. The combination of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms was the most commonly investigated sleep measure. The results indicated that both short (≤6 hours) and long (≥9 hours) sleep duration were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, mortality, cognitive decline, and poor diet. Insomnia symptoms, frequent snoring, and risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) were also associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease. However, many significant results were attenuated after multivariable adjustment. Limitations of these WHI examinations include the use of different categories for sleep measures across studies and a lack of examination by race/ethnicity. Owing to the longitudinal study design, large sample size, and long-term follow-up for health outcomes, the WHI serves as a rich resource for examining associations between sleep characteristics, demographics, and health in postmenopausal women.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Over the past decade, we have made remarkable progress in the treatment of heart failure, including drug therapies, device therapies, and regeneration therapies. However, as each of these heart failure therapies does not go much beyond symptomatic therapy, there is a compelling need to establish novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure in a fundamental way. As cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated cells, protein quality control is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, optimal performance, and longevity. There are five evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for ensuring protein quality control in cells: the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, the unfolded protein response, SUMOylation, and NEDDylation. Recent research has clarified the molecular mechanism underlying how these processes degrade misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in cardiomyocytes. In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests that deviation from appropriate levels of protein quality control causes cellular dysfunction and death, which in turn leads to heart failure. We herein review recent advances in understanding the role of protein quality control systems in heart disease and discuss the therapeutic potential of modulating protein quality control systems in the human heart.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Early-onset CAA cases generally have been found only in rare genetic forms of CAA. Interestingly, however, CAA-related hemorrhages have been recently reported in younger people who had histories of neurosurgery with or without evidence of cadaveric dura mater grafts in childhood. It has been established in experimental settings that amyloid β-protein (Aβ) pathology can be transmitted inter-individually with Aβ seeds. Incidental Aβ pathology, predominantly Aβ-CAA, has been recognized in recipients of cadaveric dura mater grafts or cadaveric human growth hormone. These findings suggest that transmission of Aβ seeds through dura mater grafts and other contaminated materials could lead to development of CAA. In addition, neurosurgery or brain injury may contribute to cerebrovascular Aβ deposition through the disturbance of vascular Aβ drainage pathways.

The deficits in AD brains do not spread randomly, and even though we do not know where to find the initial deficit or which biomolecule is involved, the brain region where the initial change occurs is surely connected functionally to the brain regions that subsequently show detectable damage.

Recently, we and others have demonstrated that Hippo signaling is also essential for maintaining the immune system homeostasis. Unlike the canonical Mst-Lats-Yap signal pathway, which controls tissue growth during development and regeneration, most studies regarding Hippo signaling in immune regulation is focusing in Mst1/2, the core kinases of Hippo signaling, cross-talking with other signaling pathways in various immune cells. In particular, patients bearing a loss-of-function mutation of Mst1 develop a complex immunodeficiency syndrome. Regarding the Hippo signaling in innate immunity, we have reported that Mst1/2 kinases are required for phagocytosis and efficient clearance of bacteria in phagocytes by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; and at the same time, by sensing the excessive ROS, Mst1/2 kinases maintain cellular redox homeostasis and prevent phagocytes aging and death through modulating the stability of the key antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2. In addition, we have revealed that the Mst1/2 kinases are critical in regulating T cells activation and Mst1/2-TAZ axis regulates the reciprocal differentiation of Treg cells and Th17 cells to modulate autoimmune inflammation by altering interactions between the transcription factors Foxp3 and RORγt.

Using Erikson's theory as a framework, the present study investigated generativity as a moderator of the effects of parenting a child with a disability on parents' well-being during mid- to late life. Using data from the study of Midlife in the United States, we identified 220 parents who had a child with a disability and 3,784 parents whose children did not have a disability. Regression analyses showed that the effect of parenting a child with a disability on negative affect, positive affect, and physical health was conditional on both parental gender and generativity, with mothers experiencing greater adverse effects of parenting but showing a benefit from high levels of generativity.</AbstractText>"}

The current study investigated the course of PM symptoms and performance over approximately one year in younger and older persons with and without HIV disease. <b>Method</b>: Participants included 77 older (&gt;50 years) and 35 younger (&lt;40 years) HIV+ individuals and 44 older and 27 younger seronegative adults. Participants completed the Memory for Intentions Test to measure PM in the laboratory, the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire to measure PM symptoms in daily life, and several clinical measures of executive functions and retrospective memory as a part of a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation at baseline and at 14-month follow-up. <b>Results</b>: Findings showed additive, independent main effects of HIV and aging on time- and event-based PM performance in the laboratory, but no change in PM over time. There were no interactions between time and HIV or age groups. Parallel findings were observed for clinical measures of retrospective memory and executive functions. Older HIV+ adults endorsed the greatest frequency of PM symptoms, but there was no change in PM symptom severity over time and no interactions between time and HIV or age groups. There were no effects of HIV or aging on naturalistic PM performance longitudinally. <b>Conclusion</b>: Overall these findings suggest that PM symptoms and performance in the laboratory are stably impaired over the course of a year in the setting of aging and HIV disease.</AbstractText>"}

Little is known about the episodic disability experiences of people living long-term with HIV in resource-limited countries, which is best understood by following people over time. This qualitative longitudinal study examined the episodic disability experiences and the applicability of four types of episodic disability among people living with HIV and on anti-retroviral therapy in Zambia. We interviewed 31 men and women living with HIV on 3 occasions at 6-month intervals (total of 93 interviews) examining the processes of change over time. We used disability models to inform the interviews exploring impairments/symptoms, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Longitudinal analyses of transcribed interviews confirmed the applicability of four types over time: stable, increasing disability, decreasing disability and significant fluctuations. Analyses highlighted the extent to which determinants of health contributed to the disability experienced. The use of disability models revealed the importance of environmental and social influences on disability and quality of life. The indicators of the type of episodic disability could be used clinically to help understand the nature and potential triggers of the episodes.</AbstractText>"}

For that, they incorporated the use of AD's specific biomarkers to reach a diagnosis, including the identification of Aβ and tau depositions, glucose hypometabolism, and cerebral atrophy. These biomarkers created a new concept of the disease, in which AD's main pathological processes have already taken place decades before we can clinically diagnose the first symptoms. Therefore, AD is now considered a dynamic disease with a gradual progression, and dementia is its final stage. With that in mind, new models were proposed, considering the orderly increment of biomarkers and the disease as a continuum, or the variable time needed for the disease's progression. In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) created separate diagnostic recommendations for each stage of the disease continuum-preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. However, new scientific advances have led them to create a unifying research framework in 2018 that, although not intended for clinical use as of yet, is a step toward shifting the focus from the clinical symptoms to the biological alterations and toward changing the future diagnostic and treatment possibilities. This review aims to discuss the role of biomarkers in the onset of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Such studies largely observe that cross-sectionally a higher BMI is associated with shorter sleep and that in longitudinal studies shorter sleep duration is associated with increases in BMI over time, but some research has found no relationship between the two. This narrative review is not exhaustive, but appraises the literature on sleep duration and BMI from perspectives that have previously been unexplored in a single paper. As such, I discuss research in these important areas: bidirectionality, objective vs. subjective sleep duration, how meaningful the effect sizes are and how we have begun to address causality in this area. From the evidence appraised in this review, it is clear that: (i) there is some modest evidence of a bidirectional relationship between BMI and sleep duration in both children and adults; (ii) objective measurements of sleep should be used where possible; (iii) it remains difficult to confirm whether the effect sizes are conclusively meaningful in a clinical setting, but at least in adults this so far seems unlikely; (iv) to date, there is no solid evidence that this relationship (in either direction) is in fact causal. In the near future, I would like to see triangulation of these findings and perhaps a move towards focusing on distinct aspects of the relationship between obesity and sleep that have not previously been addressed in detail, for various reasons.</AbstractText>"}

For this purpose, we developed two distinct FTPs, namely, a guided-breathing meditation program (BP) and a walking program (WP); we adopted the approach of Sasang constitutional (SC) medicine, which categorizes individuals into one of three SC types (SC1, SC2, or SC3) for medical care. The FTPs ran 11 sessions over 11 weeks. We recruited 29/31/28 participants who were 65 years of age or older for the BP/WP/control groups, respectively; obtained electrophysiological measurements via electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), and bioimpedance; and analyzed the intervention effects with analysis of covariance. Compared with the control, the BP and WP resulted in benefits for neural activity and parasympathetic nervous activity (PNA), respectively, and both FTPs yielded distinct beneficial effects on bioimpedance. Constitution-specific effects were also present. The SC1- and SC2-type participants gained positive effects in neural activity from the BP and WP, respectively. The SC3-type participants showed improvements in PNA from the WP. In conclusion, for older individuals, both programs conferred health benefits that would help prevent dementia, and the benefits were program-specific and constitution-specific.</AbstractText>"}

The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term effects of the introduction of FCEMs' policy on the utilization and accessibility of primary healthcare service for elderly beneficiaries. <i>Methods</i>: The retrospective study was conducted in Qidong County in the Jiangsu province, China. A 47-month longitudinal dataset involving 91,444 health insurance claims records of inpatients aged 70 and older in primary healthcare institutions was analyzed. Changes in health service utilization (average length of stay), patient copayments (out-of-pocket expenses), New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) reimbursement rate and daily hospitalization costs per patient were analyzed using interrupted time series analysis. Augment Dicky-Fuller unit root method was used to test the stationarity of the series alongside the Durbin Watson method to test autocorrelation. <i>Results</i>: Average length of stay increased at 0.372 bed-days per month before the implementation of FCEMs policy, whereas the increasing trend was slowed down at 0.003 bed-days per month after the implementation of FCEMs policy (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average out-of-pocket expenses increased by 38.035 RMB monthly in pre-implementation of the policy period, but it decreased at the rate of 5.180 RMB per month after the implementation of the FCEMs policy (<i>p</i> = 0.006). The NRCMS reimbursement rate increased at 0.066% per month in pre-implementation of policy and the increasing trend was sharper at 0.349% in post-implementation of policy (<i>p</i> = 0.135). The daily hospitalization costs per patient decreased by 6.263 RMB (<i>p</i> = 0.030) per month, whereas it increased at the rate of 3.119 RMB (<i>p</i> = 0.002) per month afterwards. <i>Conclusions</i>: Based on interrupted time series analyses, we concluded that FCEMs policy was associated with positive changes of average LOS and average OOP expenses. The FCEMs policy has alleviated the financial burden of the rural seniors and slightly improved the efficiency of primary health service utilization. However, it had no positive effect on daily hospitalization costs. Therefore, in the general framework of FCEMs policy, the Chinese health policy-maker should take necessary supporting measures to curb climbing hospitalization expenditures and promote the rational drug use in primary healthcare institutions.</AbstractText>"}

Their evaluation is based on the following descriptors: mechanical strength, elastic modulus and strain work to fracture. Supposed to reflect factors of environmental degradation conditions, thermal fatigue was simulated with a special computer-controlled device performing algorithms of thermocycling. The specimens intended for the strength test underwent 10<sup>4</sup> hydro-thermal fatigue cycles. This procedure of thermocycling was preceded by aging, which meant immersing the specimens in artificial saliva at 37 °C for 30 days. The strength tests after aging only and after aging and thermocycles were performed in line with the three-point flexural strength (TFS) test, specified in ISO 4049, and the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) test, specifically piston-on-three-ball in accordance with ISO 6872. Based on the results, it can be stated that composites with higher volume content of inorganic particles after aging only show higher strength than materials with lower filler particle content. For example, the average flexural bending strength of the Ex-flow (G) composite was about 45% lower than the value obtained for the Ex-nano (G) material. The residual strength after thermocycles is significantly lower for the experimental composites, whereas a smaller decrease in strength is recorded for the commercial composites. Decreases in strength were about 4% (Filtek Z550), 43% (Ex-nano (G)), and 29% (Ex-flow (G)) for the BFS test; and about 17% (Filtek Z550), 55% (Ex-nano (G)), 60% (Ex-flow (G)) for the TFS test. The elastic modulus of the experimental composites after only aging is higher (about 42%) than that of the commercial composite, but the elastic modulus of the commercial composite increases significantly after thermocycling. A descriptor known as strain work to fracture turns out to be a good descriptor for evaluating the hydro-thermal fatigue of the tested polymer-ceramic composites.</AbstractText>"}

The increase of reactive oxygen species with the advancement of age is responsible for the oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA, enhancing the risk of diseases. The antioxidant response and the activation of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation process represent the first defences activated by organisms at all life stages to counteract damage to cell structures and genomic material. The regulation of poly(ADP ribosyl)ation with age is little known in plants, especially in combination with antioxidant defences modulation. In this study, the relationships between poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant pool have been studied together with the photosynthetic apparatus efficiency in the Mediterranean species <i>Cistus incanus</i> L., examining leaves at different developmental stages: young, mature and senescent. The photosynthetic performance was evaluated by chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence measurement, the total soluble and fat-soluble antioxidant capacity, as well as the activities of enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), were determined by spectrophotometer, PARP activity was assessed by radioactive labelling. The highest photochemical activity was observed in young leaves, together with the highest GST activity. With the progress of the ageing process, the non-enzymatic antioxidant pool (namely ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol) declined, reaching the lowest value in senescent leaves, whereas PARP activity rose significantly. The overall results indicate that the decline of photosynthetic apparatus efficiency during senescence is due to the reduction of specific defences against oxidative damages, which increase the damages to DNA, as demonstrated by PARP activity rise.</AbstractText>"}

Abnormal cholesterol metabolism is linked to numerous disorders, including atherosclerosis. The brain contains the highest level of cholesterol in the body and abnormal cholesterol metabolism links also many neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, PD, Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The blood brain barrier effectively prevents uptake of lipoprotein-bound cholesterol from blood circulation. Accordingly, cholesterol level in the brain is independent from that in peripheral tissues. Because cholesterol metabolism in both peripheral tissue and the brain are quite different, cholesterol metabolism associated with neurodegeneration should be examined separately from that in peripheral tissues. Here, we review and compare cholesterol metabolism in the brain and peripheral tissues.

Further, in situ positron-electron annihilation techniques allow for an investigation of aging processes with increased sensitivity. For the artificial aging temperatures of 180 °C and 210 °C pronounced variations of the Doppler broadening S-parameter reveal (i) the evolution of clusters into larger precipitates and (ii) the time of the formation of [Formula: see text]' precipitates and the role of vacancies in connection to this. Towards higher aging times, the transformation from coherent [Formula: see text]' to semi-coherent [Formula: see text]' precipitates could be verified.

As a neuromodulator, dopamine selectively inhibits or enhances synaptic signaling to coordinate neural output for action, attention, and affect. Humans invariably lose brain dopamine during aging, and this can be exacerbated in disease states such as Parkinson's Disease. Further, it is well established in multiple disease states that cell loss is selective for a subset of highly sensitive neurons within the nigrostriatal dopamine tract. Regional differences in dopamine tone are regulated pre-synaptically, with subcircuits of projecting dopamine neurons exhibiting distinct molecular and physiological signatures. Specifically, proteins at dopamine release sites that synthesize and package cytosolic dopamine, modulate its release and reuptake, and alter neuronal excitability show regional differences that provide linkages to the observed sensitivity to neurodegeneration. The aim of this review is to outline the major components of dopamine homeostasis at neurotransmitter release sites and describe the regional differences most relevant to understanding why some, but not all, dopamine neurons exhibit heightened vulnerability to neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These mice are known for having extended lifespan, healthspan and female reproductive longevity. Seventeen α-estradiol (17α-E2) is reported to increase insulin sensitivity and extend lifespan in male mice, with less robust effects in female mice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ovarian reserve in wild type and GHRKO mice treated with 17α-E2. The mice were divided into four groups, GHRKO mice receiving a standard chow diet, GHRKO mice treated 17α-E2, wild type mice receiving a standard chow diet and WT mice treated with 17α-E2. 17α-E2 was provided in the diet for four months. IGF1 plasma concentrations and changes in body weight were assessed. Histological slides were prepared from the ovaries and the number of follicles was counted. GHRKO mice receiving the control diet had a greater number of primordial follicles and lower numbers of primary follicles compared to the other groups (p &lt; 0.05). 17α-E2 treatment decreased the number of primordial follicles in GHRKO mice (p &lt; 0.05), however had no effect in wild type mice. Treatment with 17α-E2 had no significant effect on the change in body weight during the experiment (p = 0.75). Plasma IGF1 concentrations were significantly lower in GHRKO mice as compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that GHRKO mice displayed lesser primordial follicle activation as compared to wild type mice, but this phenotype was reversed by 17α-E2 administration, suggesting that ovarian aging is increased by 17α-E2 in long-living mice with extended reproductive longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear, though it is known that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is critical for supporting episodic simulation in general. Therefore, individuals who have compromised MTL functioning, such as older adults and those who have undergone resection of medial temporal lobe tissue as treatment for epilepsy (mTLE patients), may not show the prosocial effects of episodic simulation. Our lab previously found that older adults and mTLE patients are impaired on a problem-solving task that requires the simulation of hypothetical scenarios. Using similar logic in the present study, we predicted that older adults and mTLE patients would show reduced effects of episodic simulation on their empathic concern for, and willingness to help, people in hypothetical situations of need, compared to young adults and age-matched healthy controls, respectively. We also predicted that the subjective vividness and the amount of context-specific detail in imagined helping events would correlate with willingness to help and empathic concern. Participants read brief stories describing individuals in situations of need, and after each story either imagined themselves helping the person or performed a filler task. We analyzed the details in participants' oral descriptions of their imagined helping events and also collected subjective ratings of vividness, willingness to help, and empathic concern. Episodic simulation significantly boosted willingness to help in all groups except for mTLE patients, and it increased empathic concern in young adults and healthy controls but not in older adults or mTLE patients. While the level of context-specific detail in participants' oral descriptions of imaged events was unrelated to willingness to help and empathic concern, the effects of episodic simulation on these measures was completely mediated by subjective vividness, though to a significantly lesser degree among mTLE patients. These results increase our understanding not only of how episodic simulation works in healthy people, but also of the social and emotional consequences of compromised MTL functioning.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Late diagnosis at an advanced, inoperable stage makes chemotherapy a treatment of choice, yet, with low response rates. The hedgehog signaling pathway (HHSP) is often reactivated in cancer. We identified miR-182-5p as a regulator of GLI2, a transcriptional regulator of the HHSP, and explored the role of the miR-182-5p/GLI2 axis in carcinogenesis and cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Expression of miRNAs and target genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR, expression of the GLI-protein family in LADC and adjacent lung tissue (n = 27 pairs) by immunohistochemistry. MiR-182-5p was manipulated, and data were generated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis, proliferation/viability, dual-luciferase-, and colony forming assays. MiR-182-5p was down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant LADC cells and directly targeted GLI2. Interference with miR-182-5p or GLI2 silencing resulted in modulation of cell proliferation, clonogenic potential, and cisplatin-sensitivity. HHSP was markedly reactivated in LADC tissue compared to adjacent non-malignant lung tissue. Our results indicate that the miR-182-5p/GLI2 axis modulates tumorigenesis and cisplatin-resistance in LADC cells, by influencing the HHSP. Therefore, this axis might be considered as a potential biomarker and future therapeutic target in LADC patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that old as compared to young antiviral CD8+TM more effectively harness disparate molecular processes (cytokine signaling, trafficking, effector functions, and co-stimulation/inhibition) that in concert confer greater secondary reactivity. The relative reliance on these pathways is contingent on the nature of the secondary challenge (greater for chronic than acute viral infections) and over time, aging CD8+TM re-establish a dependence on the same accessory signals required for effective priming of naïve CD8+T cells in the first place. Thus, our findings reveal a temporal regulation of complementary recall response determinants that is consistent with the recently proposed 'rebound model' according to which aging CD8+TM properties are gradually aligned with those of naïve CD8+T cells; our identification of a broadly diversified collection of immunomodulatory targets may further provide a foundation for the potential therapeutic 'tuning' of CD8+TM immunity.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is unclear if and how older adults with CI modify their activities (i.e., Do individuals continue, monitor, seek help with, change their approach to, or stop different activities?). In the current study, we examined if older adults with CI are concerned about their ability to carry out complex activities, if and how they modify activities based on their concern, and the factors associated with activity modification. We hypothesized that older adults with CI will more frequently be concerned about, and modify, everyday activities than cognitively healthy (HE) older adults, and that higher awareness of memory loss in the CI group would relate to more frequent modification. The sample included 81 older adults (51 HEs; mean age 70.02 (7.34) and 30 CI; mean age 75.97 (8.12)). Compared to HEs, the CI group reported having more concern about, F(3,77) = 5.50, p = 0.02, and modifying a greater number of activities, F(3,77) = 5.02, p = 0.03. Medication management (30%) and completing taxes (33.3%) were among the most frequently modified activities for the CI and HE groups, respectively. In the CI group, higher memory awareness was associated with more concern (r = .53, p = .005) and activity modification (r = 0.55, p = .003). Findings provide novel information about how cognitively diverse older adults navigate complex activities in daily life. We propose a preliminary theoretical model by which self-awareness may influence navigation of everyday activities in the context of CI.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we investigated the effects of CAT on hepatic steatosis and autophagy in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, as well as in hepatocytes. In ob/ob mice, CAT reduced liver weight, liver triglyceride and cholesterol content, and hepatic lipogenic enzyme levels and increased fatty acid oxidase levels. In addition, CAT administration increased LC3-II levels and decreased SQSTM1/P62 levels in ob/ob mice. Similar effects on hepatic steatosis and autophagy were observed in high-fat diet-induced mice after administration of CAT. Additionally, we found that CAT stimulated AMPK and increased nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in obese mice and hepatocytes. Inhibition of AMPK completely blocked the effects of CAT on TFEB nuclear localization, hepatic autophagy, and liver steatosis. These findings revealed that diminished AMPK/TFEB-dependent autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis in obesity, and that CAT might be a novel therapeutic candidate for treatment of this condition.</AbstractText>"}

We found that PCA improved 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced behavioral deficits and dopaminergic cell loss. Moreover, PCA increased the expressions of PLK2, p-GSK3β and Nrf2, following the decrease of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Cell viability was increased and the apoptosis rate was reduced by PCA in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-incubated cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial complex I activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MPP<sup>+</sup>-incubated cells were also ameliorated by treatment with PCA. The neuroprotective effects of PCA were abolished by inhibition or knockdown of PLK2, whereas overexpression of PLK2 strengthened the protection of PCA. Furthermore, GSK3β and Nrf2 were involved in PCA-induced protection. These results indicated that PCA has therapeutic effects on PD by the PLK2/p-GSK3β/Nrf2 pathway.</AbstractText>"}

Important co-morbidities in older patients with heart failure include atrial fibrillation, renal impairment, hypertension and anaemia. Diagnosing and managing heart failure in older patients are complicated due to atypical presentations, co-morbidities and a relative lack of evidence for commonly used treatments in younger patients. The growing epidemic of heart failure is also under-recognised and resourced in most health systems. Despite potential differences, we recommend that the basic approach to manage heart failure patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of &lt;40% should be the same in older and younger. These treatments need to be started at low doses and titrated slowly along with the management of co-morbidities. Older patients with EF 40-49% can be treated in a similar manner to those with &lt;40%, while the treatment of those with EF ≥50% is pragmatic in nature based on symptom control and management of co-morbidities although the evidence base for these recommendations is lacking. Overall management must be holistic and continuous based on the patient's social circumstances and ongoing needs. Finally, there is an urgent need for more research, evidence and resources directed towards older populations with heart failure to improve their care and the quality of life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Despite exponential increase in data generation, systematic identification of key regulatory factors for controlling cellular phenotype to enable cell rejuvenation in disease or ageing remains a challenge. Here, we present SigHotSpotter, a computational tool to predict hotspots of signaling pathways responsible for the stable maintenance of cell subpopulation phenotypes, by integrating signaling and transcriptional networks. Targeted perturbation of these signaling hotspots can enable precise control of cell subpopulation phenotypes. SigHotSpotter correctly predicts the signaling hotspots with known experimental validations in different cellular systems. The tool is simple, user-friendly and is available as web-server or as stand-alone software.

To better understand the independent effects of both processes, we investigated how age and time to death relate to changes in functional health over up to 12 years. Additionally, adopting the disablement process model for an end-of-life perspective, we investigated if both age and time to death moderate associations of information processing speed and subjective well-being with functional health. Data from the German Ageing Survey were used. Our sample consisted of 578 participants who had died between 2002 and 2016 (mean age at death: 76.59 years, range 45-95 years). Information processing speed was measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. The well-being indicators assessed were positive affect and depressive symptoms. Based on longitudinal multilevel regression models, we found that functional health significantly decreased over time in study. Approaching death was a stronger predictor of functional health decline than was chronological age. Regarding moderation effects, controlling for gender, education, and multimorbidity, individuals closer to death at baseline revealed stronger associations of both depressive symptoms and information processing speed with baseline functional health, whereas these associations were not moderated by chronological age. Our findings suggest that change in functional health is more strongly affected by time to death than by chronological age. Moreover, there may be a growing importance of cognitive resources and well-being for functional health with advanced 'tertiary aging,' but not with progression of 'primary aging.'

Studies of social networks and associations with well-being have mostly focused on age-restricted samples of older adults or specific geographic areas, thus limiting their generalizability. We analyzed 2 online surveys conducted with RAND's American Life Panel, a national adult life span sample recruited through multiple probability-based approaches. In Survey 1, 496 participants assessed the sizes of their social networks, including the number of close friends, family members, neighbors, and peripheral others. Of those, 287 rated their social satisfaction and well-being on Survey 2. Older participants reported smaller social networks, largely because of reporting fewer peripheral others. Yet older age was associated with better well-being. Although the reported number of close friends was unrelated to age, it was the main driver of well-being across the life span-even after accounting for the number of family members, neighbors, and peripheral others. However, well-being was more strongly related to social satisfaction than to the reported number of close friends-suggesting that it is the perception of relationship quality rather than the perception of relationship quantity that is relevant to reporting better well-being. We discuss implications for social network interventions that aim to promote well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

By 2030, half of the world is expected to be living in water-stressed conditions, given current climate change scenarios. A key goal of the UN Water Action Decade and Sustainable Development Goal 6 is to improve water security for the three billion people globally affected, but the future looks grim. For many communities, from Cape Town, South Africa to Flint, United States, the imagined dystopian future of severe water shortages has already arrived-shaped not so much by lack of water, but by aging infrastructure, underfunded utilities, social exclusion, politicized commodification, and environmental racism. Stepping off from my biocultural research in Cochabamba, Bolivia, I discuss how recent research is dramatically advancing our understanding of water insecurity, such as new findings around the biocultural causes and consequences of dehydration, contamination, and water stress. But, much more needs be done to support local communities in creating fair and just water systems.

After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The USA Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus, live zoster vaccine (LZV), for clinical use amongst older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), has also been approved. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system.

The review now includes a total of 24 studies involving 88,531 participants. Only three studies assessed the incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan. Fifteen studies used LZV. Nine studies tested an RZV. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Most data for the primary outcome (incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-quality evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6) of mild to moderate intensity (moderate-quality evidence). These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or over. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-quality evidence). There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that there symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All of the other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV and RZV are effective in preventing herpes zoster disease for up to three years (the main studies did not follow participants for more than three years). To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

There is emerging evidence that many of these side effects are caused by drug-induced impairment of mitochondrial function and eventual mitochondrial dysfunction. It is imperative to understand how and why drug-induced side effects occur and how mitochondrial function is affected. In an aging population, age-associated drug toxicity is another key area of focus as the majority of patients on medication are older. Therefore, with an aging population possessing subtle or even more dramatic individual differences in mitochondrial function, there is a growing necessity to identify and understand early on potentially significant drug-associated off-target effects and toxicity issues. This will not only reduce the number of unwanted side effects linked to mitochondrial toxicity but also identify useful mitochondrial-modulating agents. Mechanistically, many successful drug classes including diabetic treatments, antibiotics, chemotherapies and antiviral agents have been linked to mitochondrial targeted effects. This is a growing area, with research to repurpose current medications affecting mitochondrial function being assessed in cancer, the immune system and neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease. Here, we review the effects that pharmacological agents have on mitochondrial function and explore the opportunities from these effects as potential disease treatments. Our focus will be on cancer treatment and immune modulation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

Risk of suicide is particularly high among patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder or severe depression, especially when associated with mixed features or agitation, or with co-occurring substance abuse. Factors contributing to such risk include relative social and geographic isolation and low access to sources of support or clinical care. In addition, unemployment, poverty, demoralisation and opioid abuse have been identified as important risk factors. Notably, overall longevity rates in the US, though rising for many decades, have recently been declining, in part owing to suicide and substance overdoses. A particular circumstance associated with strikingly high rates of suicides and attempts is the days and weeks following discharge from psychiatric hospitalisation. Although the incidence of such events is low, there is a need for more secure aftercare planning and implementation.

{"PMID":31696454,"Title":"Nutrition and Athlete Bone Health.","Journal":"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)","Date":"Dec 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Athletes should pay more attention to their bone health, whether this relates to their longer-term bone health (e.g. risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis) or their shorter-term risk of bony injuries. Perhaps the easiest way to do this would be to modify their training loads, although this advice rarely seems popular with coaches and athletes for obvious reasons. As such, other possibilities to support the athletes' bone health need to be explored. Given that bone is a nutritionally modified tissue and diet has a significant influence on bone health across the lifespan, diet and nutritional composition seem like obvious candidates for manipulation. The nutritional requirements to support the skeleton during growth and development and during ageing are unlikely to be notably different between athletes and the general population, although there are some considerations of specific relevance, including energy availability, low carbohydrate availability, protein intake, vitamin D intake and dermal calcium and sodium losses. Energy availability is important for optimising bone health in the athlete, although normative energy balance targets are highly unrealistic for many athletes. The level of energy availability beyond which there is no negative effect for the bone needs to be established. On the balance of the available evidence it would seem unlikely that higher animal protein intakes, in the amounts recommended to athletes, are harmful to bone health, particularly with adequate calcium intake. Dermal calcium losses might be an important consideration for endurance athletes, particularly during long training sessions or events. In these situations, some consideration should be given to pre-exercise calcium feeding. The avoidance of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is important for the athlete to protect their bone health. There remains a lack of information relating to the longer-term effects of different dietary and nutritional practices on bone health in athletes, something that needs to be addressed before specific guidance can be provided.</AbstractText>"}

This includes increasing expenditures for medicines, although these increases when expressed as a share of overall societal wealth are more moderate than often claimed. An increasing use of generic medicines (currently about 90% of all prescriptions) means that costs for discovery and development of innovative drugs must be recovered on a shrinking percentage of prescriptions. However, the key challenge to affordable drugs is exponentially increasing costs to bring a new medicine to the market, which in turn are largely driven by an about 90% attrition rate after start of clinical development. While many factors will be required in concert to keep innovative medicines affordable, reducing attrition appears to be the factor with the greatest potential to contain escalating drug development costs and thereby medication expenditures.</AbstractText>"}

During this period, 8122 snout swabs or other respiratory specimens from pigs of 5178 herds, mainly from Germany, were investigated for the presence of swine influenza A virus (S-IAV). In total, 1310 S-IAV isolates were collected. Of this collection, the complete genome of 267 H1N2 S-IAV isolates was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The data demonstrate the incursion of human-like swine H1N2 viruses (Gent/1999-like) in 2000 and prevalent circulation until 2010. From 2008 onward, a sustained and broad change of the genetic constellation of the swine H1N2 subtype commenced. The Gent/1999-like swine H1N2 viruses ceased and several new swine H1N2 reassortants emerged and became prevalent in Germany. Of these, the upsurge of the Diepholz/2008-like, Emmelsbuell/2009-like and Papenburg/2010-like viruses is notable. The data reveal the importance of reassortment events in S-IAV evolution. The strong circulation of S-IAV of different lineages in the swine population throughout the year underlines that pigs are important reservoir hosts.</AbstractText>"}

Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task, we investigated the neural substrates of JOL predictions in a group of 105 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Associations of JOL performance and its neural correlates with amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology, two proteinopathies associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging, were also examined. We found that trials judged as learned well relative to trials judged as learned less well (high JOL &gt; low JOL) engaged the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, among other midline regions, in addition to bilateral hippocampi. In this cohort of older adults, greater levels of entorhinal tau deposition were associated with overestimation of memory performance and with lower fMRI signal in midline regions during predicted memory success. No associations with Aβ were found. The findings suggest that tau pathology in unimpaired older adults may play a role in altered metamemory processes.

However, species whose skulls are impacted by strong muscular stresses - particularly those produced through mastication of tough food items - may not display such intrinsic patterns very clearly because of the known plastic response of bone to muscle activity of the individual. In such cases, allometry may not dominate within-species shape variation, even if it is a driver of evolutionary shape divergence; ordination of shape in a geometric morphometric context through principal component analysis (PCA) should reveal main variation in areas under masticatory stress (incisor region/zygomatic arches/mandibular ramus); but this main variation should emerge from high individual variability and thus have low eigenvalues.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Results' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>We assessed the evidence for high individual variation through 3D geometric morphometric shape analysis of crania and mandibles of three species of grazing-specialized wombats, whose diet of tough grasses puts considerable strain on their masticatory system.

Also as expected, the main variation was in the muzzle, zygomatic arches, and masticatory muscle attachments of the mandibular ramus. We then implemented a new test to ask if the landmark variation reflected on PC1 was reflected in individuals with opposite PC1 scores and with opposite shapes in Procrustes space.

Endothelial function was examined <i>in vitro</i> by isometric myography of pulmonary and mesenteric arteries. Lipid peroxidation in blood plasma, heart and lung tissue was used as measures of oxidative stress. Expression and phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase were quantified by Western blot.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Results and Conclusion' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>A single simulated dive was found to induce endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary arteries of ApoE KO rats, and this was more profound in male than female rats. Endothelial dysfunction in males was associated with changing in production or bioavailability of NO; while in female pulmonary arteries an imbalance in prostanoid signaling was observed. No effect of diving was found on mesenteric arteries from rats of either sex. Our findings suggest that changes in endothelial dysfunction were specific for pulmonary circulation. In future, human translation of these findings may suggest caution for divers who are elderly or have prior reduced endothelial function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Berenji Ardestani, Matchkov, Eftedal and Pedersen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Smooth muscle cells (SMC) and pericytes are present in both arterioles and venules, so immunocytochemistry for markers specific to intramural cells (IMC) is unreliable. This study employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a canine brain to produce robust criteria for the correct identification of cerebral arterioles and venules based on lumen:vessel wall area, tested against the less accurate lumen diameter:vessel wall thickness. We first used morphology of IMC to identify two distinct groups of vessels; group 1 with morphology akin to venules and group 2 with morphology akin to arterioles. We then quantitatively assessed these vessels for lumen:vessel wall area ratio and lumen diameter:wall thickness ratio. After assessing 112 vessels, we show two distinct groups of vessels that can be separated using lumen:vessel wall area (group 1, 1.89 -10.96 vs. group 2, 0.27-1.57; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not using lumen diameter:vessel wall thickness where a substantial overlap in ranges between groups occurred (group 1, 1.58-22.66 vs. group 2, 1.40-11.63). We, therefore, conclude that lumen:vessel wall area is a more sensitive and preferred method for distinguishing cerebral arterioles from venules. The significance of this study is wide, as cerebral small vessel disease is a key feature of vascular dementia and understanding the pathogenesis relies on correct identification of vessels.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 MacGregor Sharp, Criswell, Dobson, Finucane, Verma and Carare.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In addition, patients can have a pronounced symptom burden. Herein, contributors to the symptomatic burden, as well as the thrombotic and transformative tendencies are reviewed. From a symptom perspective, some are explained by cytokine release, others by microvascular complications, whereas certain symptoms can herald disease evolution. Thrombosis has multifactorial contributors, including but not limited to gender, and inflammatory stress; investigators have recently hypothesized that microparticles and Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formations may add to thrombotic burden.

SVT presents with a lower incidence than deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs and pulmonary embolism, with portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome being respectively the most and the least common presentations of SVT. SVT is classified as provoked if secondary to a local or systemic risk factor, or unprovoked if the causative trigger cannot be identified. Diagnostic evaluation is often affected by the lack of specificity of clinical manifestations: the presence of one or more risk factors in a patient with a high clinical suspicion may suggest the execution of diagnostic tests. Doppler ultrasonography represents the first line diagnostic tool because of its accuracy and wide availability. Further investigations, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography, should be executed in case of suspected thrombosis of the mesenteric veins, suspicion of SVT-related complications, or to complete information after Doppler ultrasonography. Once SVT diagnosis is established, a careful patient evaluation should be performed in order to assess the risks and benefits of the anticoagulant therapy and to drive the optimal treatment intensity.

Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing mitochondria in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a lipid signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases, lipid transfer proteins and metabolic enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours. Our results identify the mTORC1-LIPIN1-YME1L axis as a post-translational regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis at the interface between metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics.</AbstractText>"}

The lack of effective techniques and the high levels of pollution produced by the conventional extraction of bioactive compounds using organic solvents have highlighted the need to enhance the 'green chemistry' trend. This study evaluates the use of ultrasound to extract bioactive compounds from orange peel. The antioxidant capacity, phenolic content, ascorbic acid, total carotenoids, and HPLC profile of phenolic compounds from orange peel extracts were obtained by a physicochemical evaluation. The results demonstrate that the optimal conditions for the ultrasound-assisted extraction of bioactive orange peel compounds were a power of 400 W, a time of 30 min, and 50% ethanol in water. These conditions were used to obtain a total carotenoid concentration of 0.63 mg ß-carotene/100 g, vitamin C concentration of 53.78 mg AA/100 g, phenolic concentration of 105.96 mg GAE/100 g, and antioxidant capacity of ORAC = 27.08 mM TE and TEAC = 3.97 mM TE.

Dysfunction of these tissues leads to ocular hypertension and increases the risk for developing glaucoma. Previous work by our laboratory revealed dysregulated autophagy in aging and in glaucomatous TM cells. In order to gain more insight in the role of autophagy in the TM pathophysiology, we have conducted transcriptome and functional network analyses of TM primary cells with silenced expression of the autophagy genes Atg5 and Atg7. Atg5/7-deficient TM cells showed changes in transcript levels of several fibrotic genes, including TGFβ2, BAMBI, and SMA. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy was associated with a parallel reduction in TGFβ-induced fibrosis, caused by a BAMBI-mediated reduced activation of Smad2/3 signaling in autophagy-deficient cells. At the same time, TGFβ treatment led to Smad2/3-dependent dysregulation of autophagy in TM cells, characterized by increased LC3-II levels and autophagic vacuoles content. Together, our results indicate a cross-talk between autophagy and TGFβ signaling in TM cells.</AbstractText>"}

Few objective protocols exist for QC following variant calling from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. After applying QC filtering based on Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) best practices, we used genotype discordance of eight samples that were sequenced twice each to evaluate the proportion of potentially inaccurate variant calls. We designed a QC pipeline involving hard filters to improve replicate genotype concordance, which indicates improved accuracy of genotype calls. Our pipeline analyzes the efficacy of each filtering step. We initially applied this strategy to well-characterized variants from the ClinVar database, and subsequently to the full WGS dataset. The genome-wide biallelic pipeline removed 82.11% of discordant and 14.89% of concordant genotypes, and improved the concordance rate from 98.53% to 99.69%. The variant-level read depth filter most improved the genome-wide biallelic concordance rate. We also adapted this pipeline for triallelic sites, given the increasing proportion of multiallelic sites as sample sizes increase. For triallelic sites containing only SNVs, the concordance rate improved from 97.68% to 99.80%.

Material aging and degradation has important implications for lifetime performance of materials and systems. While consensus exists that materials should be studied and designed for degradation, materials inspection during operation is typically performed manually by technicians. The manual inspection makes studies prone to errors and uncertainties due to human subjectivity. In this work, we focus on automating the process of degradation mechanism detection through the use of a fully convolutional deep neural network architecture (F-CNN). We demonstrate that F-CNN architecture allows for automated inspection of cracks in polymer backsheets from photovoltaic (PV) modules. The developed F-CNN architecture enabled an end-to-end semantic inspection of the PV module backsheets by applying a contracting path of convolutional blocks (encoders) followed by an expansive path of decoding blocks (decoders). First, the hierarchy of contextual features is learned from the input images by encoders. Next, these features are reconstructed to the pixel-level prediction of the input by decoders. The structure of the encoder and the decoder networks are thoroughly investigated for the multi-class pixel-level degradation type prediction for PV module backsheets. The developed F-CNN framework is validated by reporting degradation type prediction accuracy for the pixel level prediction at the level of 92.8%.</AbstractText>"}

The disease is characterized by motor, behavioural and cognitive symptoms for which at present there are no disease altering treatments. It has been shown that manipulating the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway using rapamycin or its analogue CCI-779 can improve the cellular and behavioural phenotypes of HD models. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is a major downstream signalling molecule of mTOR, and its activity is reduced by rapamycin suggesting that deregulation of S6K1 activity may be beneficial in HD. Furthermore, S6k1 knockout mice have increased lifespan and improvement in age-related phenotypes. To evalute the potential benefit of S6k1 loss on HD-related phenotypes, we crossed the R6/2 HD model with the long-lived S6k1 knockout mouse line. We found that S6k1 knockout does not ameliorate behavioural or physiological phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model. Additionally, no improvements were seen in brain mass reduction or mutant huntingtin protein aggregate levels. Therefore, these results suggest that while a reduction in S6K1 signalling has beneficial effects on ageing it is unlikely to be a therapeutic strategy for HD patients.</AbstractText>"}

Microarray profiling, STRING analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed to confirm the candidate genes and long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) related to BPH. Collagen Type III (COL3A1) was significantly upregulated by TGFβ1 in prostate stromal cells (PrSCs) and might be involved in DNM3OS function in myofibroblasts upon TGFβ1 stimulation. Upon TGFβ1 stimulation, COL3A1 protein was decreased by DNM3OS silencing. miR-29a and miR-29b could directly bind to the DNM3OS and COL3A1 3' untranslated region (UTR)s to negatively regulate their expression, and by serving as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA), DNM3OS competed with COL3A1 for miR-29a/29b binding, therefore counteracting miR-29a/29b-mediated COL3A1 suppression. The effect of DNM3OS silencing on ECM components and TGFβ1 downstream signaling was similar to that of the TGFβ1 inhibitor SB431542. miR-361 could target DNM3OS and TGFβ1; DNM3OS competed for miR-361 binding to counteract miR-361-mediated TGFβ1 suppression. In conclusion, we identified DNM3OS as a specifically-upregulated lncRNA upon TGFβ1 stimulation in PrSCs; by serving as a ceRNA for the miR-29a/29b cluster and miR-361, DNM3OS eliminated miRNA-mediated suppression of COL3A1 and TGFβ1, thereby promoting TGFβ1-induced PrSC transformation into myofibroblasts.</AbstractText>"}

The voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.1 has a central role in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), raising the possibility that it may also initiate the adaptive response to changes during muscle activity. Here, we revealed the existence of a gene transcription switch of the CaV1.1 β subunit (CaVβ1) that is dependent on the innervation state of the muscle in mice. In a mouse model of sciatic denervation, we showed increased expression of an embryonic isoform of the subunit that we called CaVβ1E. CaVβ1E boosts downstream growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) signaling to counteract muscle loss after denervation in mice. We further reported that aged mouse muscle expressed lower quantity of CaVβ1E compared with young muscle, displaying an altered GDF5-dependent response to denervation. Conversely, CaVβ1E overexpression improved mass wasting in aging muscle in mice by increasing GDF5 expression. We also identified the human CaVβ1E analogous and show a correlation between CaVβ1E expression in human muscles and age-related muscle mass decline. These results suggest that strategies targeting CaVβ1E or GDF5 might be effective in reducing muscle mass loss in aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In contrast, food restriction in honeybees (<i>Apis</i><i>mellifera</i>) shortens lifespan by accelerating a behavioural maturation program that culminates in leaving the nest as a forager. Foraging is metabolically demanding and risky, and foragers experience increased rates of aging and mortality. Food-deprived worker bees forage at younger ages and are expected to live shorter lives. We tested whether suppression of a molecular nutrient sensing pathway is sufficient to accelerate the behavioural transition to foraging and shorten worker life. To achieve this, we reduced expression of the <i>insulin receptor substrate</i> (<i>irs</i>) gene via RNA interference in two selected lines of honeybees used to control for behavioural and genetic variation. <i>irs</i> encodes a membrane-associated protein in the insulin/insulin-like signalling (IIS) pathway that is central to nutrient sensing in animals. We measured foraging onset and lifespan and found that suppression of <i>irs</i> reduced worker bee lifespan in both genotypes, and that this effect was largely driven by an earlier onset of foraging behaviour in a genotype-conditional manner. Our results provide the first direct evidence that an IIS pathway gene influences behavioural maturation and lifespan in honeybees and highlight the importance of considering social environments and behaviours when investigating the regulation of aging and lifespan in social animals.</AbstractText>"}

This is especially important since age is a major risk factor for chronic disease and the proportion of older adults in North America is increasing. Beans can contribute to a food-first approach to healthy aging as they are nutrient-dense and can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. However, studies exploring awareness and knowledge of beans in older adults are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore older adults' awareness of beans in relation to their nutrient content and role in chronic disease risk. Community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years old) were recruited and completed a validated researcher-administered questionnaire (<i>n</i> = 250), which was followed by 10 focus groups (<i>n</i> = 49). Results showed that the majority of older adults considered beans as a healthy food and thought consuming them could improve their health (99.2% and 98.0%, respectively); however, only 51.2% were bean consumers. While the majority (83.6%) of older adults were aware that a serving of beans is high in dietary fibre, bean consumers were significantly more likely to think that consuming beans could improve health areas related to dietary fibre including body weight management and constipation. Furthermore, most (84.8%) older adults thought consuming beans could improve heart health; however, bean consumers were significantly more likely to be aware that one serving of beans is low in nutrients relevant to heart health including total fat, saturated and <i>trans</i> fat as well as cholesterol.

Therefore, silicone resin polymer was used as a kind of innovative fog seal material in this study. Physicochemical properties of solidified silicone resin were characterized. X-ray computed tomography and 3D reconstruction technology were used to evaluate permeability and distribution of silicone resin polymer in an asphalt mixture. Moisture sensitivity and high-temperature performance of the asphalt mixture maintained by silicone resin polymer were also detected. The results show that surface characteristic of silicone resin can effectively isolate moisture, thereby improving moisture resistance of the asphalt mixture. Silicone resin was found to be evenly distributed throughout the pores of a sample when the dosage was 400 or 600 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. The pore filling rate increased by 16.3% when the dosage was changed from 200 to 400 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, whereas it only increased by 3.7% when dosage increased from 400 to 600 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. Moisture damage resistance of asphalt mixtures generally increased as the dosage of silicone was increased. However, as the dosage increased from 400 to 600 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, the growth rate in residual Marshall stability (RMS) and tensile strength ratio (TSR) slowed significantly since the pore filling effect of silicone has reached the upper limit. Dosage of silicone resin has little effect on the results of the rutting test while it has significant influence on Hamburg wheel tracking test (HWT). Furthermore, it was found that 400 mL/m<sup>2</sup> is the optimum silicone dosage for open-graded friction course (OGFC)-13 mixture in consideration of permeability, distribution, performance of mixture, and economic cost.</AbstractText>"}

We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that explored cortical thickness in medication-free patients with MDD, using a newly developed meta-analytic mask compatible with seed-based d mapping (SDM) meta-analytic software. We performed the meta-regression to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics on variation in cortical thickness in MDD. Fifteen studies describing 529 patients and 586 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Medication-free patients with MDD, relative to HCs, showed a complex pattern of increased cortical thickness in some areas (posterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex) and decreased cortical thickness in others (gyrus rectus, orbital segment of the superior frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus). Most findings in the whole sample analysis were confirmed in a meta-analysis of studies recruiting medication-naive patients. Using the new mask specifically developed for SBM studies, this SDM meta-analysis provides evidence for regional cortical thickness alterations in MDD, mainly involving increased cortical thickness in the default mode network and decreased cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal and temporal cortex.</AbstractText>"}

However, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Studying mice, we find that the number of motor units (MUs) can be maintained by counteracting neurotoxic microglia in the aged spinal cord. We observe that marked innervation changes, detected by motor unit number estimation (MUNE), occur prior to loss of muscle function in aged mice. This coincides with gene expression changes indicative of neuronal remodeling and microglial activation in aged spinal cord. Voluntary exercise prevents loss of MUs and reverses microglia activation. Depleting microglia by CSF1R inhibition also prevents the age-related decline in MUNE and neuromuscular junction disruption, implying a causal link. Our results suggest that age-related changes in spinal cord microglia contribute to neuromuscular decline in aged mice and demonstrate that removal of aged neurotoxic microglia can prevent or reverse MU loss.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Cerebral blood flow decreases with aging and is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives disease progression in mouse models of AD and in models of cognitive impairment associated with atherosclerosis, closely recapitulating vascular cognitive impairment. In the present studies, we sought to determine whether mTOR plays a role in cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline during normative aging in rats. Using behavioral tools and MRI-based functional imaging, together with biochemical and immunohistochemical approaches, we demonstrate that chronic mTOR attenuation with rapamycin ameliorates deficits in learning and memory, prevents neurovascular uncoupling, and restores cerebral perfusion in aged rats. Additionally, morphometric and biochemical analyses of hippocampus and cortex revealed that mTOR drives age-related declines in synaptic and vascular density during aging. These data indicate that in addition to mediating AD-like cognitive and cerebrovascular deficits in models of AD and atherosclerosis, mTOR drives cerebrovascular, neuronal, and cognitive deficits associated with normative aging. Thus, inhibitors of mTOR may have potential to treat age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline. Since treatment of age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction in older adults is expected to prevent further deterioration of cerebral perfusion, recently identified as a biomarker for the very early (preclinical) stages of AD, mTOR attenuation may potentially block the initiation and progression of AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

This involves the establishment of alternative therapeutic protocols, such as probiotic microorganisms whose antifungal potential has already been demonstrated using preclinical models (cell cultures, laboratory animals).

In this study, we investigated the prophylactic anti-C. albicans properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35® using the in vitro Caco-2 cell model and the in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model. In Caco-2 cells, we showed that the strain Lcr35® significantly inhibited the growth (~2 log CFU.mL-1) and adhesion (150 to 6,300 times less) of the pathogen. Moreover, in addition to having a pro-longevity activity in the nematode (+42.9%, p = 3.56.10-6), Lcr35® protects the animal from the fungal infection (+267% of survival, p &lt; 2.10-16) even if the yeast is still detectable in its intestine. At the mechanistic level, we noticed the repression of genes of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway and genes involved in the antifungal response induced by Lcr35®, suggesting that the pathogen no longer appears to be detected by the worm immune system. However, the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, implicated in the longevity and antipathogenic response of C. elegans, is activated by Lcr35®.

Active DNA demethylation involves TET-mediated stepwise oxidation of mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine (fC), or 5-carboxylcytosine (caC), excision of fC or caC by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), and subsequent base excision repair. Many elements of this essential process are poorly defined, including TDG excision of caC. To address this problem, we solved high-resolution structures of human TDG bound to DNA with cadC (5-carboxyl-2'-deoxycytidine) flipped into its active site. The structures unveil detailed enzyme-substrate interactions that mediate recognition and removal of caC, many involving water molecules. Importantly, two water molecules contact a carboxylate oxygen of caC and are poised to facilitate acid-catalyzed caC excision. Moreover, a substrate-dependent conformational change in TDG modulates the hydrogen bond interactions for one of these waters, enabling productive interaction with caC. An Asn residue (N191) that is critical for caC excision is found to contact N3 and N4 of caC, suggesting a mechanism for acid-catalyzed base excision that features an N3-protonated form of caC but would be ineffective for C, mC, or hmC. We also investigated another Asn residue (N140) that is catalytically essential and strictly conserved in the TDG-MUG enzyme family. A structure of N140A-TDG bound to cadC DNA provides the first high-resolution insight into how enzyme-substrate interactions, including water molecules, are impacted by depleting the conserved Asn, informing its role in binding and addition of the nucleophilic water molecule.</AbstractText>"}

In studying the influence of prey traits on predation risk, previous researchers have shown that crypsis reduces attack rates on resting prey, predation risk increases with increased prey activity, and rapid locomotion reduces attack rates and increases chances of surviving predator attacks. However, evidence for these conclusions is nearly always based on observations of selected species under artificial conditions. In nature, it remains unclear how defensive traits such as crypsis, activity levels and speed influence realized predation risk across species in a community. Whereas direct observations of predator-prey interactions in nature are rare, insight can be gained by quantifying bodily damage caused by failed predator attacks. We quantified how butterfly species traits affect predation risk in nature by determining how defensive traits correlate with wing damage caused by failed predation attempts, thereby providing the first robust multi-species comparative analysis of predator-induced bodily damage in wild animals. For 34 species of fruit-feeding butterflies in an African forest, we recorded wing damage and quantified crypsis, activity levels and flight speed. We then tested for correlations between damage parameters and species traits using comparative methods that account for measurement error. We detected considerable differences in the extent, location and symmetry of wing surface loss among species, with smaller differences between sexes. We found that males (but not females) of species that flew faster had substantially less wing surface loss. However, we found no correlation between cryptic coloration and symmetrical wing surface loss across species. In species in which males appeared to be more active than females, males had a lower proportion of symmetrical wing surface loss than females. Our results provide evidence that activity greatly influences the probability of attacks and that flying rapidly is effective for escaping pursuing predators in the wild, but we did not find evidence that cryptic species are less likely to be attacked while at rest.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

With the introduction of rod segments, much more complexity and multifunctionality can be achieved in the self-assembly of rod-alt-coil ACPs. Herein, we have performed a simulation study on the self-assembly of rod-alt-coil ACPs in dilute solution through dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations. A morphological phase diagram was constructed as a function of rod and coil length, in which diverse assemblies were found, such as bicontinuous micelles and perforated membranes. Furthermore, the alignment of rod segments in the assemblies has been disclosed in detail. And, we deeply investigated the effects of rod length, coil length and π-π interaction strength on the self-assembly morphologies and rod alignment. With the increase of rod length, a disorder-order transition was observed, and π-π interactions could facilitate the orderly alignment of rods. Besides, our simulation results showed good agreement with available experiments. Furthermore, the unique characteristics in the self-assembly of rod-alt-coil alternating copolymers were discussed; in particular we found that the alternating molecular structures of ACPs could promote the orderly alignment of rod segments.

This repair depends on stimulation pattern, with complex biomimetic patterns being particularly effective, and the presence of cryptochrome, a putative magnetoreceptor. Only repair-promoting LI-rTMS patterns up-regulated genes involved in neuronal repair; almost 40% of were cryptochrome targets. Our data open a new framework to understand the mechanisms underlying structural neuroplasticity induced by electromagnetic stimulation.

However, all <i>BMPR2</i> mutation carriers do not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension, and inflammation could trigger the development of the disease in <i>BMPR2</i> mutation carriers. Circulating levels and/or lung tissue expression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-18 are elevated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and could be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We consequently hypothesized that cytokines could trigger endothelial dysfunction in addition to impaired BMPRII signaling. Our aim was to determine whether impairment of BMPRII signaling might affect endothelium barrier function and adhesiveness to monocytes, in response to cytokines. <i>BMPR2</i> was silenced in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) using lentiviral vectors encoding microRNA-based hairpins. Effects of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 on HLMVEC adhesiveness to the human monocyte cell line THP-1, adhesion molecule expression, endothelial barrier function and activation of P38MAPK were investigated in vitro. Stable <i>BMPR2</i> silencing in HLMVECs resulted in impaired endothelial barrier function and constitutive activation of P38MAPK. Adhesiveness of <i>BMPR2</i>-silenced HLMVECs to THP-1 cells was enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 through ICAM-1 adhesion molecule. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-α induced activation of P38MAPK and disrupted endothelial barrier function in <i>BMPR2</i>-silenced HLMVECs.

Cross-linking of glycation products to proteins results in the formation of cross-linked proteins that inhibit the normal functioning of the cell. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are risk molecules for the cell aging process. These ends products are increasingly synthesized in diabetes and are essentially responsible for diabetic complications. They accumulate in the extracellular matrix and bind to receptors (receptor of AGE [RAGE]) to generate oxidative stress and inflammation. particularly in the cardiovascular system. Treatment methods targeting the AGE system may be of clinical importance in reducing and preventing the complications induced by AGEs in diabetes and old age. The AGE cross-link breaker alagebrium (a thiazolium derivative) is the most studied anti-AGE compound in the clinical field. Phase III clinical studies with alagebrium have been successfully conducted, and this molecule has positive effects on cardiovascular hypertrophy, diabetes, hypertension, vascular sclerotic pathologies, and similar processes. However, the mechanism is still not fully understood. The primary mechanism is that alagebrium removes newly formed AGEs by chemically separating α-dicarbonyl carbon-carbon bonds formed in cross-linked structures. However, it is also reported that alagebrium is a methylglyoxal effective inhibitor. It is not yet clear whether alagebrium inhibits copper-catalyzed ascorbic acid oxidation through metal chelation or destruction of the AGEs. It is not known whether alagebrium has a direct association with RAGEs.

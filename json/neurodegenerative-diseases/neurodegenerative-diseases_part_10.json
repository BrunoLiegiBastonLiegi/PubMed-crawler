Previous evidence showed that in a mouse model of a familial form of ALS expressing high levels of the human mutated protein Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Gly(93)--&gt;Ala, G93A), the firing properties of single motor neurons are altered to induce neuronal hyperexcitability. To determine whether the functionality of the macroscopic voltage-dependent Na(+) currents is modified in G93A motor neurons, in the present work their physiological properties were examined. The voltage-dependent sodium channels were studied in dissociated motor neurons in culture from nontransgenic mice (Control), from transgenic mice expressing high levels of the human wild-type protein [superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)], and from G93A mice, using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp recording technique. The voltage dependency of activation and of steady-state inactivation, the kinetics of fast inactivation and slow inactivation of the voltage-dependent Na(+) channels were not modified in the mutated mice. Conversely, the recovery from fast inactivation was significantly faster in G93A motor neurons than that in Control and SOD1. The recovery from fast inactivation was still significantly faster in G93A motor neurons exposed for different times (3-48 h) and concentrations (5-500 microM) to edaravone, a free-radical scavenger. Clarification of the importance of these changes in membrane ion channel functionality may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications in the pathogenesis of ALS.</AbstractText>"}

The neuroadaptations underlying these effects of chronic alcohol abuse are likely due to altered gene expression. Previous gene expression studies using human post-mortem brain demonstrated that several gene families were altered by alcohol abuse. However, most of these changes in gene expression were small. It is not clear if gene expression profiles have sufficient power to discriminate control from alcoholic individuals and how consistent gene expression changes are when a relatively large sample size is examined. In the present study, microarray analysis (approximately 47,000 elements) was performed on the superior frontal cortex of 27 individual human cases (14 well characterized alcoholics and 13 matched controls). A partial least squares statistical procedure was applied to identify genes with altered expression levels in alcoholics. We found that genes involved in myelination, ubiquitination, apoptosis, cell adhesion, neurogenesis, and neural disease showed altered expression levels. Importantly, genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease were significantly altered suggesting a link between alcoholism and other neurodegenerative conditions. A total of 27 genes identified in this study were previously shown to be changed by alcohol abuse in previous studies of human post-mortem brain. These results revealed a consistent re-programming of gene expression in alcohol abusers that reliably discriminates alcoholic from non-alcoholic individuals.</AbstractText>"}

Since enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with learning and memory, and the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system has been shown to modulate these cognitive functions, we hypothesized that activation of noradrenergic neurotransmission might enhance neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we induced the release of noradrenaline in the hippocampus by blocking presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptors with the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist dexefaroxan. Confocal microscopy showed that noradrenergic afferents make contact with proliferating and differentiating cells, suggesting a direct noradrenergic influence on neurogenesis. Chronic systemic treatment of rats with dexefaroxan did not affect cell proliferation per se in the dentate gyrus (as monitored by bromodeoxyuridine-labeling), but promoted the long-term survival of newborn neurons by reducing apoptosis. Dexefaroxan treatment also enhanced the number and complexity of the dendritic arborizations of polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule-positive neurons. The trophic effects of dexefaroxan on newborn cells might involve an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which was upregulated in afferent noradrenergic fiber projection areas and in neurons in the granule cell layer. By promoting the survival of new endogenously formed neurons, dexefaroxan treatment represents a potential therapeutic strategy for maintaining adult neurogenesis in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, that affect the hippocampus.</AbstractText>"}

Transgenic mice expressing high levels of halpha-syn displayed severe neurological alterations and died prematurely at 6 months of age. Furthermore, mice developed progressive accumulation of halpha-syn-immunoreactive inclusions in oligodendrocytes along the axonal tracts in the brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebellum, corpus callosum, and neocortex. The inclusions also reacted with antibodies against phospho-serine (129) halpha-syn and ubiquitin, and halpha-syn was found in the detergent-insoluble fraction. In high-expresser lines, the white matter tracts displayed intense astrogliosis, myelin pallor, and decreased neurofilament immunostaining. Accumulation of halpha-syn in oligodendrocytes also leads to prominent neurodegenerative changes in the neocortex with decreased dendritic density and to loss of dopaminergic fibers in the basal ganglia. The oligodendrocytic inclusions were composed of fibrils and accompanied by mitochondrial alterations and disruption of the myelin lamina in the axons. Together, these studies support the contention that accumulation of alpha-syn in oligodendrocytes promotes neurodegeneration and recapitulates several of the key functional and neuropathological features of MSA.</AbstractText>"}

The rTg(tau(P301L))4510 mouse expresses the P301L mutation in tau (4R0N) associated with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Transgene expression was driven by a forebrain-specific Ca(2+) calmodulin kinase II promoter system resulting in high levels of expression in the hippocampus and neocortex. Importantly, transgene expression in this model is induced via the tetracycline-operon responsive element and is suppressed after treatment with doxycycline. Continued transgene expression in rTg(tau(P301L))4510 mice results in age-dependent development of many salient characteristics of hereditary human dementia. From an early age, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated abnormal biochemical processing of tau and the presence of pathological conformation- and phosphorylation-dependent epitopes. Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology was first observed in the neocortex and progressed into the hippocampus and limbic structures with increasing age. Consistent with the formation of NFTs, immunoblots indicated an age-dependent transition of accumulating tau species from Sarkosyl soluble 55 kDa to insoluble hyperphosphorylated 64 kDa. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of straight tau filaments. Furthermore, the effects of tau(P301L) expression on spatial reference memory were longitudinally tested using the Morris water maze. Compared with nontransgenic age-matched control littermates, rTg(tau(P301L))4510 mice developed significant cognitive impairments from 4 months of age.

Despite these proteins having widespread and overlapping expression patterns in the brain, a specific and unique subset of neurons exhibits particular vulnerability in each disease. It has been hypothesized that perturbation of normal protein function contributes to the specificity of neuronal vulnerability; however, the normal biological functions of many of these proteins including the HD gene product, Huntingtin (Htt), are unclear. To explore the roles of Htt, we have used antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to observe the effects of Htt deficiency in early zebrafish development. Knockdown of Htt expression resulted in a variety of developmental defects. Most notably, Htt-deficient zebrafish had hypochromic blood due to decreased hemoglobin production, despite the presence of iron within blood cells. Furthermore, transferrin receptor 1 transcripts were increased, suggesting cellular iron starvation. Provision of iron to the cytoplasm in a bio-available form restored hemoglobin production in Htt-deficient embryos. Since erythroid cells acquire iron via receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, these results suggest a role for Htt in making endocytosed iron accessible for cellular utilization. Iron is required for oxidative energy production, and defects in iron homeostasis and energy metabolism are features of HD pathogenesis that are most pronounced in the major region of neurodegeneration. It is therefore plausible that perturbation of Htt's normal role in the iron pathway (by polyglutamine tract expansion) contributes to HD pathology, and particularly to its neuronal specificity.</AbstractText>"}

So far, the biological functions of the synucleins are still unclear, but their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer may provide insights into the pathological processes that result from these two groups of debilitating diseases, and present the possibility to use them as potential targets for early diagnosis and treatment. Recently, elevated levels of gamma-syn proteins have been detected in various types of cancer, especially in advanced stages of the disease. Furthermore, studies to date indicate that overexpression of gamma-syn compromises normal mitotic checkpoint controls, resulting in multinucleation as well as faster cell growth. Gamma-syn has also been shown to promote invasion and metastasis in in vitro assays as well as in animal models. Overexpression of gamma-syn also interferes with drug-induced apoptotic responses. These observations raise questions about the involvement of gamma-syn in the process of tumorigenesis and metastasis, and efforts have already been made to use gamma-syn as a marker for assessing breast cancer progression.

Functional studies of PINK1 were performed utilizing RNA interference in cell culture models. Following inactivity, the PINK1 locus had an opposing regulation pattern (PINK1 was down-regulated while natural antisense PINK1 was up-regulated). In type 2 diabetes skeletal muscle, all transcripts from the PINK1 locus were suppressed and gene expression correlated with diabetes status. RNA interference of PINK1 in human neuronal cell lines impaired basal glucose uptake. In adipose tissue, mitochondrial gene expression correlated with PINK1 expression although remained unaltered following siRNA knockdown of Pink1 in primary cultures of brown preadipocytes. In conclusion, regulation of the PINK1 locus, previously linked to neurodegenerative disease, is altered in obesity, type 2 diabetes and inactivity, while the combination of RNAi experiments and clinical data suggests a role for PINK1 in cell energetics rather than in mitochondrial biogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Using a well characterized reporter system that we developed to allow in vivo observations, we have explored how the osmolyte proline influences the stability and aggregation of a model aggregation-prone protein, P39A cellular retinoic acid-binding protein. Strikingly, we find that the natural osmolyte proline abrogates aggregation both in vitro and in vivo (in an Escherichia coli expression system). Importantly, proline also prevented aggregation of constructs containing exon 1 of huntingtin with extended polyglutamine tracts. Although compatible osmolytes are known to stabilize the native state, our results point to a destabilizing effect of proline on partially folded states and early aggregates and a solubilizing effect on the native state. Because proline is believed to act through a combination of solvophobic backbone interactions and favorable side-chain interactions that are not specific to a particular sequence or structure, the observed effect is likely to be general. Thus, the osmolyte proline may be protective against biomedically important protein aggregates that are hallmarks of several late-onset neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. In addition, these results should be of practical importance because they may enable protein expression at higher efficiency under conditions where aggregation competes with proper folding.</AbstractText>"}

Because amyloid-beta peptides are generally accepted to play a key role in Alzheimer disease, gamma-secretase inhibition holds the promise for a disease-modifying therapy for this neurodegenerative condition. Although recent progress has enhanced the understanding of the biology and composition of the gamma-secretase enzyme complex, less information is available on the actual interaction of various inhibitor classes with the enzyme. Here we show that the two principal classes of inhibitor described in the scientific and patent literature, aspartyl protease transition state analogue and small molecule non-transition state inhibitors, display fundamental differences in the way they interact with the enzyme. Taking advantage of a gamma-secretase enzyme overexpressing cellular system and different radiolabeled gamma-secretase inhibitors, we observed that the maximal binding of non-transition state gamma-secretase inhibitors accounts only for half the number of catalytic sites of the recombinant enzyme complex. This characteristic stoichiometry can be best accommodated with a model whereby the non-transition state inhibitors bind to a unique site at the interface of a dimeric enzyme. Subsequent competition studies confirm that this site appears to be targeted by the main classes of small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug gamma-secretase modulator sulindac sulfide displayed noncompetitive antagonism for all types of inhibitor. This finding suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-type gamma-secretase modulators target an alternative site on the enzyme, thereby changing the conformation of the binding sites for gamma-secretase inhibitors.</AbstractText>"}

CR and IF affect energy and oxygen radical metabolism, and cellular stress response systems, in ways that protect neurons against genetic and environmental factors to which they would otherwise succumb during aging. There are multiple interactive pathways and molecular mechanisms by which CR and IF benefit neurons including those involving insulin-like signaling, FoxO transcription factors, sirtuins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.

The etiology of the most abundant, sporadic forms is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Several environmental pollutants have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders. The present article focuses on results obtained in experimental neurotoxicology studies that indicate a potential pathogenic role of lead and mercury in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Both heavy metals have been shown to interfere with a multitude of intracellular targets, thereby contributing to several pathogenic processes typical of neurodegenerative disorders, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, deregulation of protein turnover, and brain inflammation. Exposure to heavy metals early in development can precondition the brain for developing a neurodegenerative disease later in life. Alternatively, heavy metals can exert their adverse effects through acute neurotoxicity or through slow accumulation during prolonged periods of life. The pro-oxidant effects of heavy metals can exacerbate the age-related increase in oxidative stress that is related to the decline of the antioxidant defense systems. Brain inflammatory reactions also generate oxidative stress. Chronic inflammation can contribute to the formation of the senile plaques that are typical for AD. In accord with this view, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antioxidants suppress early pathogenic processes leading to Alzheimer's disease, thus decreasing the risk of developing the disease. The effects of lead and mercury were also tested in aggregating brain-cell cultures of fetal rat telencephalon, a three-dimensional brain-cell culture system. The continuous application for 10 to 50 days of non-cytotoxic concentrations of heavy metals resulted in their accumulation in brain cells and the occurrence of delayed toxic effects. When applied at non-toxic concentrations, methylmercury, the most common environmental form of mercury, becomes neurotoxic under pro-oxidant conditions. Furthermore, lead and mercury induce glial cell reactivity, a hallmark of brain inflammation. Both mercury and lead increase the expression of the amyloid precursor protein; mercury also stimulates the formation of insoluble beta-amyloid, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD and causes oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in vitro. Taken together, a considerable body of evidence suggests that the heavy metals lead and mercury contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases and emphasizes the importance of taking preventive measures in this regard.</AbstractText>"}

We studied the activity of creatine kinase (CK) and the function of mitochondrial respiratory chain in the brain of aged rats administered with 3-NP with and without previous application of antioxidants CoQ(10)+vitamin E. We used dynamic and steady-state methods of in vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) for determination of the pseudo-first order rate constant (k(for)) of the forward CK reaction, the phosphocreatine (PCr) to adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) ratio, intracellular pH(i) and Mg(i)(2+) content in the brain. The respiratory chain function of isolated mitochondria was assessed polarographically; the concentration of CoQ(10) and alpha-tocopherol by HPLC. We found significant elevation of k(for) in brains of 3-NP rats, reflecting increased rate of CK reaction in cytosol. The function of respiratory chain in the presence of succinate was severely diminished. The activity of cytochromeoxidase and mitochondrial concentration of CoQ(10) was unaltered; tissue content of CoQ(10) was decreased in 3-NP rats. Antioxidants CoQ(10)+vitamin E prevented increase of k(for) and the decrease of CoQ(10) content in brain tissue, but were ineffective to prevent the decline of respiratory chain function. We suppose that increased activity of CK system could be compensatory to decreased mitochondrial ATP production, and CoQ(10)+vitamin E could prevent the increase of k(for) after 3-NP treatment likely by activity of CoQ(10) outside the mitochondria. Results of our experiments contributed to elucidation of mechanism of beneficial effect of CoQ(10) administration in HD and showed that the rate constant of CK is a sensitive indicator of brain energy disorder reflecting therapeutic effect of drugs that could be used as a new in vivo biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

It is characterized by the cerebral accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta peptide assemblies (Abeta). The serine protease plasmin, which is generated from the inactive zymogen plasminogen through its proteolytic cleavage by tissue- (tPA) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator, has been implicated in the catabolism of Abeta peptides. In this report, we studied the regulation of tPA activity in vivo during ageing in normal mice and in a mouse model of AD characterized by an exacerbated endogenous Abeta accumulation. We observed that cerebral tPA activity was decreased during ageing in normal mice and that this effect was worsened in mice overproducing Abeta peptides. These phenomena result, respectively, from a decrease in tPA expression and from an increase in the production of one of the tPA inhibitors, the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). A similar study in sporadic AD and age-matched control brain tissues revealed that the tPA proteolytic activity was negatively correlated to Abeta peptides levels supporting the data observed in mice. Altogether, our data support a model in which amyloid deposition induces a decrease in tPA activity through the overproduction of PAI-1 by activated glial cells.</AbstractText>"}

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transduced with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic component of telomerase, have the potential both to proliferate indefinitely in vitro and to respond to differentiation signals necessary for generating appropriate cells for transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differentiation of neurons from NT2 cells, a model NPC cell line, following hTERT transduction. RT-PCR and telomerase activity data demonstrated that persistent exogenous hTERT expression significantly inhibited the differentiation of neurons from NT2 cells. Following retinoic acid induced differentiation, hTERT-NT2 cells produced only one fourth of the neurons generated by parental and vector-control cells. A differentiation-inhibiting effect of constitutive telomerase activity has not been reported previously in other hTERT-transduced progenitor cell lines, implying a unique role for telomerase in the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs that have tumorigenic potential. Elucidating the mechanism responsible for this effect may aid in understanding the potential role of telomerase activity in the tumorigenicity of NPCs, as well as in optimizing the production of safe, telomerase-engineered, transplantable neurons.</AbstractText>"}

Treatment of rats with 3-NP 30mgkg(-1) i.p. once a day for 5 days induced an increase in calpain activation in rat striatum, measured by the formation of 145kDa fragment of alpha-spectrin breakdown and by an increase in enzymatic calpain activity. In this neurotoxic model, Western blot studies revealed that calpain activity increase was followed by changes in cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) and its activator p25. Our results indicated, after 10 days of treatment with 3-NP, a decrease in myocyte enhancer factor phosphorylation, a neuronal prosurvival factor. Thus, a decrease in its expression indicates a new potential mechanism of neuronal cell death mediated by the neurotoxin 3-NP. Accordingly, in our study we demonstrated in rat striatum the activation of the calpain/cdk5/p25 pathway in the 3-NP model. Previous studies have linked the deregulation of cdk5 with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

These disorders are characterized by ascending degeneration of the upper motor neurons with or without lower motor neuron involvement. Thus far, a total of 12 independent ALS2 mutations, which include a small deletion, non-sense mutation, or missense mutation spreading widely across the entire coding sequence, are reported. They are predicted to result in either premature termination of translation or substitution of an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. Thus, a loss of functions in the ALS2-coded protein accounts for motor dysfunction and/or degeneration in the ALS2-linked MNDs. The ALS2 gene encodes a novel 184kDa protein of 1657 amino acids, ALS2 or alsin, comprising three predicted guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains: the N-terminal RCC1-like domain, the central Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) domains, and the C-terminal vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9) domain. In addition, eight consecutive membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs are noted in the region between DH/PH and VPS9 domains. ALS2 activates Rab5 small GTPase and involves in endosome/membrane trafficking and fusions in the cells, and also promotes neurite outgrowth in neuronal cultures. Further, a neuroprotective role for ALS2 against cytotoxicity; i.e., the mutant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-mediated toxicity, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity, has recently been implied. This review outlines current understandings of the molecular and cellular functions of ALS2 and its related proteins on safeguarding the integrity of motor neurons, and sheds light on the molecular pathogenesis of MNDs as well as other conditions of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, the nuclear targeting of mutant huntingtin increases cellular toxicity, whereas normal huntingtin resides mainly in the cytoplasm, and is associated with membranes or microtubules. Huntingtin is enriched in neurons and its expression is increased during neural development. The inactivation of the HD gene results in embryonic lethality before nervous system development. Thus, huntingtin is critical during early embryonic development. Nevertheless, the function of huntingtin at this stage is unknown, even the distribution of the protein has not been described. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the distribution of huntingtin during the early developmental period in the mouse embryo. At the preimplantation stage, huntingtin was detected in nuclei up to 2.5 days post coitum (dpc), but disappeared from nuclei during the blastocyst stage (3.5 dpc). Following this stage, huntingtin was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and co-localized with mitotic spindles.

Dynamic range, discrimination power, accuracy and reproducibility were determined with standard mRNA 'spiking' studies. Gene expression profiles in dominant and subordinate animals were compared using a 'universal' reference design [Churchill GA (2002) Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays.

Three weeks after the 6-OHDA injections, the rats were killed for estimation of lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, catecholamines, dopaminergic D2 receptor binding and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression. Increased LPO and significant depletion of reduced GSH content in the substantia nigra resulting from the lesion were appreciably prevented with Delphinium treatment. Delphinium extract also dose-dependently attenuated the activities of SOD and CAT in striatum, which had been reduced significantly by lesioning. A significant decrease in the level of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites and an increase in the number of dopaminergic D2 receptors in striatum were observed after 6-OHDA injection, both parameters were significantly recovered with treatment of the extract. Finally, all these results were confirmed by an increase in expression of TH in the ipsilateral striatum of the lesioned groups following treatment with Delphinium extract.

The organotypic slice cultures exhibit native cellular organization as well as dense arborization of neuronal processes and synaptic contacts. The hippocampal slices were exposed to 3-NP for 2-20 days, causing calpain-mediated breakdown of the spectrin cytoskeleton, a loss of pre- and postsynaptic markers, and neuronal atrophy. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine reduced both the cytoskeletal damage and synaptic decline in a dose-dependent manner. 3-NP-induced cytotoxicity, as determined by the release of lactate dehydrogenase, was also reduced by memantine with EC50 values from 1.7 to 2.3 microM. Propidium iodide fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy confirmed memantine neuroprotection against the chronic toxin exposure. In addition, the protected tissue exhibited normal neuronal morphology in the major hippocampal subfields.

Functional genomics approaches currently being undertaken in yeast may lead to novel insights into the genes and pathways that modulate neuronal cell dysfunction and death in these diseases. In addition, the budding yeast constitutes a valuable system for identification of new drug targets, both via target-based and non-target-based drug screening. Importantly, yeast can be used as a cellular platform to analyze the cellular effects of candidate compounds, which is critical for the development of effective therapeutics.

We adapted the technique of photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) to evaluate calcium-induced structural alterations in isolated viable cortical and hippocampal mitochondria. In detecting calcium-induced reductions in light intensity, PCS was more sensitive than absorbance across varying calcium concentrations. Mitochondrial populations encompass a broad distribution of sizes, confirmed by ultrastructural profiles, both which remain unaffected by calcium exposure. Cortical and hippocampal populations show fractional calcium-induced reductions in light scatter compared to subsequent maximal alamethicin-induced reductions. Although reductions in light scatter (refractive index) have been interpreted as mitochondrial swelling, PCS quantification of the mean mitochondrial radius demonstrates that mitochondrial size is unaffected by calcium exposure, but not alamethicin. Likewise, the population distribution histograms remain stable with calcium exposure, but shift to larger radii after alamethicin exposure. Furthermore, hippocampal mitochondrial populations from a neurodegenerative model of traumatic brain injury, lateral fluid percussion, demonstrate greater calcium-induced reductions in scatter intensity, which are associated with an initial population of large mitochondria becoming smaller. The disparate responses to calcium and subsequent alamethicin of mitochondria at 3 and 24 h after injury attest to an acute disruption of membrane permeability in mitochondria from injured brain.

C57Bl/6J mice received an intrastriatal graft of MHP36 neural stem cells 3 days after selective neuronal damage had been induced by global ischaemia.

In particular, a transient A-type K+ current, with a linear increase in its density with distance from soma to distal dendrites in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, has been shown to contribute to dendritic membrane excitability.

Here, we report that manipulation of muscarinic neurotransmission confers drastic changes on antiChE responses in the rat brain. In the brains of naïve, un-stressed rats, the irreversible organophosphate antiChE, diisopropylfluorophosphonate (DFP) induced post-treatment accumulation of catalytically active G1 monomers of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Pre-treatment with the selective M1 muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine, but not the general muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, attenuated this G1 increase. DFP-enhanced AChE gene expression was accompanied by diverted splicing from the primary AChE-S mRNA variant, encoding G4 synaptic membrane AChE-S tetramers, to 'readthrough' AChE-R mRNA, which encodes soluble G1 monomers. Both the mRNA increase and the shifted splicing were long lasting (&gt;24 h) and common to the parietal cortex and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons. Importantly, the splicing shift was maximal under DFP alone, as compared with sham-injected rats, and virtually preventable by pre-treatment with pirenzepine. In contrast, induction of AChE transcription was less dependent on muscarinic function, resulting in AChE-S but not AChE-R increases. Our findings demonstrate distinct regulation of the enhanced transcription and the alternative splicing reactions to antiChE treatment and shed new light on the differential responses to antiChEs of demented patients with increasingly impaired cholinergic neurotransmission.</AbstractText>"}

Studies of animal and in vitro models of disease pathogenesis additionally suggest glial accountability for some CNS degenerative processes. This review provides a critical analysis of the evidence available to date in support of the concept of gliodegeneration, which we propose to represent an essential although largely disregarded component of the spectrum of classical 'neurodegeneration'. Examples from the spectrum of alpha-synucleinopathies are presented.</AbstractText>"}

Three families harbored a previously reported A467T substitution, which was found in compound with the earlier described G848S or the W748S substitution or a novel R574W substitution. Two families harbored the W748S change in compound with either of 2 novel mutations predicted to give an R232H or M1163R substitution. Muscle morphology showed mitochondrial myopathy with cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers in 4 patients. mtDNA analyses in muscle tissue revealed mtDNA depletion in 3 of the children and mtDNA deletions in the 2 sibling pairs. Neuropathologic investigation in 3 children revealed widespread cortical degeneration with gliosis and subcortical neuronal loss, especially in the thalamus, whereas there were only subcortical neurodegenerative findings in another child. The results support the concept that deletions as well as depletion of mtDNA are involved in the pathogenesis of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and add 3 new POLG1 mutations associated with an early-onset neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText>"}

As a result, the synapse needs to be viewed as an important target for the development of novel protective treatments aimed at preventing or slowing disease progression.

We found that divalent mercury (HgCl(2)) inhibited ciliary neurotrophic factor and interferon-gamma receptor-mediated Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway activation in SK-N-BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cell cultures, but did not inhibit the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Results of dichlorofluorescein experiments showed increased levels of oxidative stress in HgCl(2)-treated cells that was similar in magnitude to that caused by treatment with H(2)O(2). The antioxidant agents glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, and sodium ascorbate each protected neurons against HgCl(2)-induced inhibition of STAT activation. HgCl(2) also inhibited Jak-STAT signaling in cultures of chick retina neurons, but did not affect signaling in nonneuronal HepG2 cells and chick skeletal myotubes. The specific inhibition of growth factor-mediated Jak-STAT signaling pathways in neurons by HgCl(2)-induced oxidative stress offers a new mechanism by which mercury may produce neurotoxic symptoms in the developing nervous system, promote neurodegeneration in mature neurons, and inhibit recovery following neurotrauma.</AbstractText>"}

Restoring the expression levels of neuronal genes in diseased neurons therefore seems to be an attractive therapeutic approach. To this end, we have developed a cell-based reporter assay for monitoring RE1/NRSE silencing activity and validated it by genetically inactivating the RE1/NRSE or pharmacologically stimulating global transcription. In a pilot compound screen, we identified three closely related structural analogues that up-regulate reporter expression at low nanomolar concentrations, and follow-up studies have shown that they efficaciously increase endogenous BDNF levels in HD cells. Moreover, one of the compounds increases the viability of HD cells.

As a model of neonatal neuronal cell death, we have examined the role of oxidative stress in Purkinje cell death in the heterozygous Lurcher mutant (+/Lc). Lurcher is a gain of function mutation in the delta2 glutamate receptor (GluRdelta2) that turns the receptor into a leaky membrane channel, resulting in chronic depolarization of +/Lc Purkinje cells starting around the first week of postnatal development. Virtually, all +/Lc Purkinje cells die by the end of the first postnatal month. To investigate the role of oxidative stress in +/Lc Purkinje cell death, we have examined nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and the expression of two markers for oxidative stress, nitrotyrosine and manganese super oxide dismutase (MnSOD), in wild type and +/Lc Purkinje cells at P10, P15, and P25. The results show that NOS activity and immunolabeling for nitrotyrosine and MnSOD are increased in +/Lc Purkinje cells. To determine whether peroxynitrite formation is a prerequisite for +/Lc Purkinje cell death, +/Lc mutants were crossed with an alpha-nNOS knockout mutant (nNOSalpha(-/-)) to reduce the production of NO. Analysis of the double mutants showed that blocking alpha-nNOS expression does not rescue +/Lc Purkinje cells. However, we present evidence for sustained NOS activity and nitrotyrosine formation in the GluRdelta2(+/Lc):nNOS(-/-) double mutant Purkinje cells, which suggests that the failure to rescue GluRdelta2(+/Lc):nNOS(-/-) Purkinje cells may be explained by the induction of alternative nNOS isoforms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Cells express a biochemical defect only when the proportion of mutated mtDNA exceeds a critical threshold, but it is not clear whether the actual cause of this defect is a loss of wild-type mtDNA, an excess of mutated mtDNA, or a combination of the two. Here, we show that segments of human skeletal muscle fibers harboring two pathogenic mtDNA mutations retain normal cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity by maintaining a minimum amount of wild-type mtDNA. For these mutations, direct measurements of mutated and wild-type mtDNA molecules within the same skeletal muscle fiber are consistent with the 'maintenance of wild type' hypothesis, which predicts that there is nonselective proliferation of mutated and wild-type mtDNA in response to the molecular defect. However, for the m.3243A--&gt;G mutation, a superabundance of wild-type mtDNA was found in many muscle-fiber sections with negligible COX activity, indicating that the pathogenic mechanism for this particular mutation involves interference with the function of the wild-type mtDNA or wild-type gene products.</AbstractText>"}

However, Turkish variant LINCL was recently found to be genetically heterogeneous, because mutations in two genes, CLN6 and CLN8, were identified to underlie the disease phenotype in a subset of patients. After a genomewide scan with single-nucleotide-polymorphism markers and homozygosity mapping in nine Turkish families and one Indian family, not linked to any of the known NCL loci, we mapped a novel variant LINCL locus to chromosome 4q28.1-q28.2 in five families. We identified six different mutations in the MFSD8 gene (previously denoted 'MGC33302'), which encodes a novel polytopic 518-amino acid membrane protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporter proteins. MFSD8 is expressed ubiquitously, with several alternatively spliced variants. Like the majority of the previously identified NCL proteins, MFSD8 localizes mainly to the lysosomal compartment. However, the function of MFSD8 remains to be elucidated. Analysis of the genome-scan data suggests the existence of at least three more genes in the remaining five families, further corroborating the great genetic heterogeneity of LINCLs.</AbstractText>"}

General anaesthetics and long-term toxicity in the CNS.","Journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","Date":"Feb 2007","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>We do not know how general anaesthetics cause their desired effects. Contrary to what has been thought until relatively recently, the clinical state of anaesthesia consists of multiple components that are mediated via interaction of the anaesthetic drugs with different targets on the molecular, the cellular, the network and the structural-anatomical levels. The mechanisms by which some of these drugs induce the different components of 'anaesthesia' may be rather specific: discrete mutations of single amino acids in specific proteins profoundly affect the ability of certain anaesthetics to achieve specific endpoints. Despite this potential specificity, inhalational anaesthetics are present in the body at very high concentrations during surgical anaesthesia. Due to their lipid solubility, general anaesthetics dissolve in every membrane, penetrate into organelles and interact with numerous cellular structures in multiple ways. A priori, it is therefore not unreasonable to assume that these drugs have the potential to cause insidious changes in the body other than those acute and readily apparent ones that we routinely monitor for. Some changes may wane within a short time after removal of the drug (e.g. the suppression of immune cell function). Others may persist after complete removal of the drug and even become self-propagating (e.g. spread of malignant cells, the beta-oligomerization of proteins), still others may be irreversible (e.g. the induction of apoptosis in the central nervous system) but of unclear significance. This article will focus on evidence for anaesthetic toxicity in the central nervous system, which appears to be susceptible to anaesthetic neurotoxicity primarily at the extremes of ages but via different pathways: in the neonate, during the period of most intense synaptogenesis, anaesthetics can induce excessive apoptosis; in the aging brain subtle cognitive dysfunction can persist long after clearance of the drug and processes resembling neurodegenerative disorders may be accelerated. At all ages, anaesthetics affect gene expression regulating protein synthesis in poorly understood ways. While it seems reasonable to assume that the vast majority of our patients completely restore homeostasis after general anaesthesia, exposure to these drugs probably has more profound and longer-lasting effects on the brain than heretofore imagined.</AbstractText>"}

In total, 105 adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into seven groups of 15 animals each. The first three groups were injected i.p. with normal saline, AC (300 mg/kg) or PLC (300 mg/kg) for 7 successive days. The next three groups were injected i.p. with the same doses of normal saline, AC or PLC immediately after the induction of 10 min forebrain ischaemia and i.p. injections were continued for 7 successive days. Rats in the seventh group were subjected to sham-operated ischaemia and injected with normal saline for 7 successive days. 3. Seven days after treatment, animals were killed and their brains isolated for histopathological examination and biochemical studies. 4. Forebrain ischaemia resulted in a significant decrease in the number of intact neurons (77%), ATP concentration (51%) and glutathione content (32%), whereas there was a significant increase in the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS; 71%) and total nitrate/nitrite (NOx; 260%) in hippocampal tissues. 5. Administration of either AC or PLC attenuated forebrain ischaemia-induced neuronal damage, manifested by a greater number of intact neurons, ATP and glutathione, as well as a decrease in TBARS and NOx in hippocampal tissues. 6. Results from the present study suggest, for the first time, that PLC attenuates forebrain ischaemia-induced neuronal injury, oxidative stress and energy depletion in the hippocampal CA1 region. Propionyl-L-carnitine has neuroprotective effects similar to AC and could have a potential use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. 7.

Deficiency in almost any of these hydrolases causes accumulation of the undigested material in secondary lysosomes, which manifests itself as a form of lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Mutations in tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP I) underlie the classic late-infantile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (CLN2), the most common neurodegenerative disorders of childhood. TPP I is an aminopeptidase with minor endopeptidase activity and Ser475 serving as an active-site nucleophile. The enzyme is synthesized as a highly glycosylated precursor transported by mannose-6-phosphate receptors to lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic maturation. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding of TPP I biology and molecular pathology of the CLN2 disease process, including distribution of the enzyme, its biosynthesis, glycosylation, transport and activation, as well as catalytic mechanisms and their potential implications for pathogenesis and treatment of the underlying disease.

Genetic loss of either Lxralpha or Lxrbeta in APP/PS1 transgenic mice results in increased amyloid plaque load. LXRs regulate basal and inducible expression of key cholesterol homeostatic genes in the brain and act as potent inhibitors of inflammatory gene expression. Ligand activation of LXRs attenuates the inflammatory response of primary mixed glial cultures to fibrillar amyloid beta peptide (fAbeta) in a receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, LXRs promote the capacity of microglia to maintain fAbeta-stimulated phagocytosis in the setting of inflammation. These results identify endogenous LXR signaling as an important determinant of AD pathogenesis in mice. We propose that LXRs may be tractable targets for the treatment of AD due to their ability to modulate both lipid metabolic and inflammatory gene expression in the brain.</AbstractText>"}

Urinary and erectile dysfunction (ED) symptoms are prominent early features in male MSA patients. Lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this disorder. More than 50% of MSA patients suffer from recurrent lower UTIs and a significant number (approximately 25%) die of complications related to them. Urogenital symptoms in MSA are usually due to a complex mixture of central and peripheral nervous abnormalities, sometimes superimposed on previous local pathological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and perineal laxity. There have been instances were MSA-related urological symptoms were confused with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, leading to unnecessary urological surgery. In this review, we present the phenotypic range and therapeutic approaches for common storage and voiding urological symptoms and ED, in patients with MSA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recent evidence suggests that some of these defects may be due to a loss of normal presenilin activity. Here, we have examined the effect of loss of Drosophila presenilin (psn) function on synaptic plasticity and learning. Basal transmitter release was elevated in psn mutants while both paired pulse synaptic plasticity and post-tetanic potentiation were impaired. These defects in synaptic strength and plasticity were not due to developmental defects in NMJ morphology. We also found that psn null terminals take up significantly less FM 4-64 than control terminals when loaded with high frequency stimulation, suggesting a defect in synaptic vesicle availability or mobilization. To determine whether these reductions in synaptic plasticity had any impact on learning, we tested the larvae for defects in associative learning. Using both olfactory and visual learning assays, we found that associative learning is impaired in psn mutants compared with controls. Both the learning and synaptic defects could be rescued by expression of a full length psn transgene suggesting the defects are specifically due to a loss of psn function. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence of learning and synaptic defects in a Drosophila psn mutant and strongly suggest a presynaptic role for presenilin in normal neuronal function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The change on the 6th day was the most noteworthy. Mitochondrial ATP content and the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis of the hippocampus were also lowered. However, after using EB or genistein, the three indicators returned to normal. It is suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) of the post-menopausal female, and may serve as the target for endogenous estrogen and exogenous phytoestrogen. In addition, genistein, which possesses the properties of estrogen but not its side effects such as carcinogenicity, could reverse the bioenergetic defects of ovariectomized rats and perhaps be used as a substitute for estradiol to prevent or treat central neurodegeneration in post-menopausal women.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we demonstrate that the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) potently inhibits the aggregation of mutant htt exon 1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Dot-blot assays and atomic force microscopy studies revealed that EGCG modulates misfolding and oligomerization of mutant htt exon 1 protein in vitro, indicating that it interferes with very early events in the aggregation process. Also, EGCG significantly reduced polyQ-mediated htt protein aggregation and cytotoxicity in an yeast model of HD. When EGCG was fed to transgenic HD flies overexpressing a pathogenic htt exon 1 protein, photoreceptor degeneration and motor function improved. These results indicate that modulators of htt exon 1 misfolding and oligomerization like EGCG are likely to reduce polyQ-mediated toxicity in vivo.

Many proteins have by immunohistochemical techniques been shown to codeposit with Abeta in AD plaques. It is possible that some of these could seed Abeta aggregation and therefore be found in the actual core of the plaque. Here, we present a highly sensitive method for unbiased biochemical analysis of plaque cores. A mild purification protocol based on centrifugation and filtration was used to purify intact plaque cores from human AD brain. The purified plaques were dispensed on a glass slide and viewed in a laser capture microscope, and plaque cores were catapulted into a tube cap by a laser beam. After dissolution in formic acid, plaques were digested and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled online to electrospray/tandem mass spectrometry. One single plaque was found to be sufficient for positive identification of the main amyloid component. Remarkably, Abeta was the only protein identified when 200 plaques were isolated and analyzed with the present method. Thus, it is possible that no proteins copolymerize with Abeta in the plaque cores and that Abeta alone is sufficient for formation of plaque cores. In support of this notion, core-like structures were observed after incubation of synthetic Abeta for 2 weeks. We suggest that the method described here could be used for the general analysis of amyloid aggregates and inclusion bodies found in other neurodegenerative disorders and that plaque cores in AD brain are molecularly homogeneous structures.</AbstractText>"}

The therapeutic results of levodopa therapy in cases of MSA are difficult to interpret because of their variability. Nevertheless, the simple statement that patients with MSA do not respond to levodopa is false. Clinical and pathologically proven series document levodopa efficacy in about 40-60% of patients with MSA and predominant parkinsonian features.

The diagnosis ideally should be confirmed with additional laboratory tests to determine the cause and evaluate the functional deficit, so as to aid treatment. A number of pharmacological agents with different mechanisms of action have been used in MSA to reduce OH when this is symptomatic. OH can also be alleviated by avoiding aggravating factors, such as the effects of food, micturition, exposure to a warm environment, and physiological diurnal changes, and by using other non-pharmacological strategies.

Before the biological basis of anticipation had been demonstrated, the phenomenon was thought to be due to sampling bias, epigenetic effects, gene conversion, or recombinant events. Since then, the biologic basis for anticipation in a number of neurodegenerative disorders has been shown to be attributable to trinucleotide repeat instability, with expansion of repeats clearly correlated with an earlier age of onset. Recently, telomere shortening has been suggested as the mechanism for anticipation in the autosomal dominant form of dyskeratosis congenita, attributable to mutations in the TERC gene, leading to dysfunctional telomeres (Vulliamy et al. 2004). However, the pattern of anticipation has been observed in other disorders, including cancers, for which no genetic defect has been identified. In this study, we assess the apparent generation effect on cancer incidence in ten extended families with P53 germline mutation, identified through probands diagnosed with childhood sarcoma. The probands were from two sets of systematically ascertained sarcoma patients treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1944 and 1982. From those overall studies, we have identified ten kindreds having germline P53 mutations in more than one generation. We compared the cancer incidence in members of successive generations of these families with P53 mutations (carriers) and with no P53 mutations (noncarriers). In carriers, cancer incidence increased in succeeding generations; there was no evidence for this effect in noncarriers; however, the noncarrier population was too small to rule it out. The apparent lack of increase in incidence in noncarriers argues against a cohort effect explaining the increase in carriers.</AbstractText>"}

Although some ROS production pathways are needed for specific physiological functions, excessive production is detrimental and is regarded as the basis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Among enzymes producing superoxide anions, NADPH oxidase is widespread in mammalian cells and is an important source of ROS in mediating physiological and pathological processes in the cardiovascular and the CNS. ROS production is linked to the alteration of intracellular calcium homeostasis, activation of Ca(2+)-dependent enzymes, alteration of cytoskeletal proteins, and degradation of membrane glycerophospholipids. There is evolving evidence that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase regulate neuronal functions and degrade membrane phospholipids through activation of phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)). This review is intended to cover recent studies describing ROS generation from NADPH oxidase in the CNS and its downstream activation of PLA(2), namely, the group IV cytosolic cPLA(2) and the group II secretory sPLA(2).

Little is known about the role of native cysteine residues in tau assembly because their substitution with other amino acids has no effect on tau filament morphology. To understand the process involved in tau oligomerization, we analysed both heparin-induced assembly of different forms of recombinant human tau and assembly of tau from COS-7 cells transiently expressing different human tau constructs. Here, we demonstrated that tau assembly involves two distinct dimers (cysteine-dependent and cysteine-independent) that differ in resistance to reduction. During assembly, an increase of cysteine-dependent tau oligomer was observed prior to detection of increased thioflavin T fluorescence signals. The latter event was accompanied by an increase of cysteine-independent dimer. Fewer higher-order oligomers and aggregates were assembled from four-repeat tau containing two amino-terminus inserts that have either the C291A/C322A mutation (cysless-4R2N) or a hexapeptide deletion at residues 306-311 (DeltaPHF6-4R2N) compared with those assembled from wild-type tau. Assembly of distinct types of dimers was also observed in lysates from COS-7 cells expressing wild-type 4R2N and brain extracts from mice expressing P301L mutant tau. In contrast, COS-7 cells expressing cysless- or DeltaPHF6-4R2N tau contained very little cysteine-dependent dimer. Together, the results indicate that intermolecular disulfide crosslinking along with PHF6 hexapeptide facilitates tau oligomerization and that this event is accompanied by cysteine-independent intermolecular bridging of microtubule-binding domain, leading to assembly of higher-order oligomers. The levels of these dimers may be used to gauge the potential for tau assembly.</AbstractText>"}

Since C1q is colocalized with thioflavine-positive plaques and the C5b-9 complement membrane attack complex is detected in AD brain at autopsy, it is reasonable to hypothesize that complement activation has a role in the manifestation of AD either by its lytic capacity or as a trigger of glial infiltration and initiation of potentially damaging inflammation. The observed diminished glial activation and reduced loss of neuronal integrity in a murine model overexpressing mutant human APP but lacking the ability to activate the classical complement cascade provide the first direct evidence for a detrimental role of C1q, and presumably activation of the classical complement pathway in an animal model of AD. Research is now focused on generating mouse models that more closely mimic the human disease, so that the role of complement activation and inflammation on the behavioral/learning and memory dysfunction that occurs in this disease can be assessed. In addition, candidate therapies such as targeted inhibition of complement activation will need to be tested in these animal models as a step toward treatment of humans with the disease.

Part A, Discoveries in molecular, cellular, and evolutionary biology","Date":"Sep 2006","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Tryptamine derivatives are a family of biogenic amines that have been suggested to be modulators of brain function at physiological concentrations. However, pharmacological concentrations of these amines display amphetamine-like properties, and they seem to play a role in brain disorders. Amphetamines induce autophagy in nerve cells, and this type of cell death has also been involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work, we clearly demonstrate for the very first time that high concentrations of tryptamine (0.1-1 mM) induce autophagy in HT22 and SK-N-SH nerve cell lines and in primary cultures of astrocytes, glial cells being less sensitive than neurons. Ultrastructural cell morphology shows all of the typical hallmarks of autophagy. There is no nuclear chromatin condensation, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria are swollen, and a great number of double-membraned autophagosomes and residual bodies can be shown in the cytoplasm. Autophagosomes and residual bodies contain mitochondria, membranes, and vesicles and remain unabridged until the cell membrane is disrupted and the cell dies. The same results have been found when cells were incubated with high concentrations of 5-methoxytryptamine (0.1-1 mM). Our results establish a possible link between the role of tryptamine derivatives in brain disorders and the presence of autophagic cell death in these kinds of disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Selective inhibitors of COX-2 have been developed as therapeutics or preventive agents for these diseases. However, recent reports have revealed a significant increase in cardiovascular mortality in long-term users of the COX-2 inhibitors Vioxx and Celebrex, emphasizing the need for noninvasive tests that allow the identification of individuals whose COX-2 levels are overexpressed prior to assignment to treatment with these drugs. In this study, we have prepared a radioiodinated analogue of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, and verified its binding to the COX-2 enzyme in vitro. Biodistribution studies in hamsters demonstrated significantly higher levels of radiotracer in animals treated with the tobacco carcinogen NNK in lung, pancreas, and liver. Assessment of COX-2 levels by whole-body planar nuclear imaging two hours after injection of the radiotracer was suggestive of a distinct increase in COX-2 in the pancreas and liver of a hamster treated for 10 weeks with NNK, in the lungs and liver of a second animal, and in the liver only, in two additional animals from the same treatment group. Immunostains showed selective overexpression of COX-2 in pre-neoplastic lesions of the pancreas and lungs in only those animals that showed tracer accumulation in these organs and in the livers of all NNK-treated hamsters. Immunostains for COX-1 yielded detectable reactions in the intestinal epithelium but not in pancreas, lungs, or liver, supporting the specificity of the tracer for COX-2. Our data provide proof of principle for the hypothesis that molecular imaging with radiolabeled COX-2 inhibitors can be used for the noninvasive monitoring of overexpressed COX-2 levels.</AbstractText>"}

Philanthotoxins bind to the pore-forming region of AMPA receptors, a subtype of glutamate receptors which are important for memory formation and are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that modification of the polyamine moiety of philanthotoxins can lead to very potent and highly selective ligands for the AMPA receptor, as exemplified with philanthotoxin-56. Much less attention has been paid to the importance of the aromatic head group of philanthotoxins, but herein we demonstrate that modification of this moiety leads to a significant improvement in potency relative to philanthotoxin-56 at cloned AMPA receptors. Interestingly, the incorporation of an adamantane moiety is particularly favorable, and the most potent compound has a Ki value of 2 nM, making it the most potent uncompetitive antagonist of AMPA receptors described to date.

The processing of APP is largely provided by three key enzymes, namely the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases. As the latter two contribute to the formation of neurotoxic Abeta fragments while alpha-secretase does not, a decrease in the amyloidogenic products can be brought about either by inhibition of the beta- and gamma-secretases or through the activation of alpha-secretase. It is now known that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) enhances alpha-secretase activity and therefore represents a possible target for the development of agents urgently needed for the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. In the present study, new benzolactam-V8-based PKC activators were synthesized and tested for their binding affinity toward PKCalpha. All compounds tested showed binding values in the nanomolar concentration range. In accordance with previous publications, 9-substitution dramatically increased PKC binding affinity in comparison with the corresponding 8-substituted analogues. In addition to the location of the side chain on the aromatic ring, the binding affinities of these benzolactams were found to depend on the orientation, length, and electronic properties of this appendage. An interesting decrease in binding affinity was found for the 9-thienyl analogue 13, suggesting adverse electronic interactions of the sulfur atom with PKC or parts of the cellular membrane.</AbstractText>"}

Within each of these categories there is a wide range of phenotypic variation that is not encountered in other neurodegenerative disorders. The identification of the prion protein and its key role in the pathogenesis of this diverse group of diseases has allowed a fuller understanding of factors that influence disease phenotype. In particular, the naturally occurring polymorphism at codon 129 in the prion protein gene has a major influence on the disease phenotype in sporadic, familial and acquired prion diseases, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent technical advances have improved our ability to study the isoforms of the abnormal prion protein in the brain and in other tissues. This has lead to the concept of molecular strain typing, in which different isoforms of the prion protein are proposed to correspond to individual strains of the transmissible agent, each with specific biological properties. In sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease there are at least six major combinations of codon 129 genotype and prion protein isotype, which appear to relate to distinctive clinical subgroups of this disease. However, these relationships are proving to be more complex than first considered, particularly in cases with more than a single prion protein isotype in the brain. Further work is required to clarify these relationships and to explain the mechanism of neuropathological targeting of specific brain regions, which accounts for the diversity of clinical features within human prion diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The current experiments test the hypothesis that a vascular insult and aging are co-factors that contribute to dementia by evaluating the neuronal and functional integrity of the hippocampus following small, localized strokes induced by the potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the rat model of hippocampal aging. The neurotoxic effects of a low dose of ET-1 injected into the hippocampus measured by lesion size (volumetrics) and cell death (Fluorojade-B) were amplified in aged rats. The aged rats also showed hippocampal-dependent memory deficits that were not present in young rats. Overall, our pattern of results suggest that the aged hippocampus is more vulnerable to the same insult that has little or no effect on the young hippocampus.</AbstractText>"}

Gene mapping in human clinical materials have in most cases failed to unravel discrete genes, since most genes instrumental in non-Mendelian forms of these complex diseases are likely to modestly affect risk, be evolutionary conserved in the population and vary between individuals. We here describe the exploration of susceptibility to neurodegeneration and inflammatory glial activation in response to mechanical nerve injury using experimental genetic models. The response to ventral root avulsion, which is a simple and reproducible model of nerve injury-induced neurodegeneration and inflammation, was examined in a panel of inbred rat strains. A whole genome scan subsequently performed in a F2(DAxPVG) intercross identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regulating different features of the nerve injury response. Fine mapping in an advanced intercross line revealed polymorphisms in the Mhc2ta gene as being responsible for strain differences in MHC class II expression. Furthermore, a polymorphism in the syntenic human gene, MHC2TA, was associated both with lower expression of MHC class II-associated genes and increased susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. These results provide important insights into the genetic regulation of fundamental physiological responses of the nervous system to damage and demonstrate relevance also for human diseases.</AbstractText>"}

In prion diseases, phospho-tau deposition has been described in a rare genetic form, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, but is not considered part of the neuropathological picture of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Aim of this study was to investigate whether changes related to phospho-tau accumulation are present in the brain of patients with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) that shares with Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease abundant prion protein (PrP) deposition in amyloid form. The analysis was extended to experimental mouse models of vCJD. We detected a large number of phospho-tau-immunoreactive neuritic profiles, often clustered around PrP amyloid deposits, not only in the cerebral cortex, but also in the cerebellum of all vCJD patients examined, in the absence of Abeta. Although less constantly, phospho-tau was localized in some perikaria and dendrites. The biochemical counterpart was the presence of phospho-tau in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cerebral cortex. Phospho-tau-immunoreactive neuronal profiles were also found in association with PrP deposits in mouse models of vCJD. These findings suggest that the abnormal forms of PrP associated with vCJD trigger a tauopathy, and provide a paradigm for the early stages of tau pathology associated with cerebral amyloidoses, including Alzheimer disease.</AbstractText>"}

Over the past ten years, it was suggested that only polyQ tracts longer than a specific threshold adopt a particular structure, which would be the cause of the apparent polyQ length-dependent toxicity threshold observed in polyQ diseases. We have used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to compare the structural properties of polyQ of pathogenic and non-pathogenic lengths under various conditions. We observe that pathogenic and non-pathogenic polyQ, as soluble species and upon interaction with a partner, during aggregation, or as mature aggregates, display very similar structural properties. PolyQ length only influences the aggregation kinetics and, to a lesser extent, the stability of the aggregates. We thus propose that polyQ toxicity does not depend on a structural transition occurring above a specific threshold, but rather that polyQ tracts are inherently toxic sequences, whose deleterious effect gradually increases with their length. We discuss how polyQ properties and other cellular factors may explain the existence of an apparent polyQ length-dependent toxicity threshold.</AbstractText>"}

These data have consequently added great impetus to the research in this field. In fact, many Glu receptor antagonists acting at the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA), and/or kainic acid (KA) receptors have been developed as research tools and potential therapeutic agents. Ligands showing competitive antagonistic action at the AMPA type of Glu receptors were first reported in 1988, and the systemically active 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) was first shown to have useful therapeutic effects in animal models of neurological disease in 1990. Since then, the quinoxaline template has represented the backbone of various competitive AMPA receptor antagonists belonging to different classes which had been developed in order to increase potency, selectivity and water solubility, but also to prolong the 'in vivo' action. Compounds that present better pharmacokinetic properties and less serious adverse effects with respect to the others previously developed are undergoing clinical evaluation.

Because of the long incubation time and highly complex disease pathogenesis, the management of nerve damage in leprosy, as in other demyelinating diseases, is extremely difficult. Therefore, an important challenge in therapeutic interventions is to identify the molecular events that occur in the early phase before the progression of the disease. Here we provide evidence that M. leprae-induced demyelination is a result of direct bacterial ligation to and activation of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling without ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization, a previously unknown mechanism that bypasses the neuregulin-ErbB3-mediated ErbB2 phosphorylation. MEK-dependent Erk1 and Erk2 (hereafter referred to as Erk1/2) signaling is identified as a downstream target of M. leprae-induced ErbB2 activation that mediates demyelination. Herceptin (trastuzumab), a therapeutic humanized ErbB2-specific antibody, inhibits M. leprae binding to and activation of ErbB2 and Erk1/2 in human primary Schwann cells, and the blockade of ErbB2 activity by the small molecule dual ErbB1-ErbB2 kinase inhibitor PKI-166 (ref. 11) effectively abrogates M. leprae-induced myelin damage in in vitro and in vivo models.

The critical role of NADPH oxidase for GIF and PACAP38 neuroprotection against LPS-induced DA neurotoxicity was demonstrated using neuron-glia cultures from mice deficient in NADPH oxidase (PHOX(-/-)), where PACAP38 and GIF reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha production and were neuroprotective only in PHOX(+/+) cultures and not in PHOX(-/-) cultures.

At 30 min and 60 min p.i., (18)F-FDG uptake was significantly higher in the frontal cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum of Brattleboro rats than in LE rats when measured by PET in vivo (p&lt;0.05), but only a trend towards higher values was found ex vivo. Our results show for the first time that brain glucose metabolism is modified in Brattleboro rats. This altered brain glucose metabolism in Brattleboro rats may be related to the observed cognitive and behavioral disorders. Functional analyses of brain metabolism are promising to investigate cognitive behavioral disturbances observed in Brattleboro rats and their link to diabetes insipidus.</AbstractText>"}

Several small-molecule inhibitors of tau aggregation have been developed for this purpose. One of them, 3,3'-bis(beta-hydroxyethyl)-9-ethyl-5,5'-dimethoxythiacarbocyanine iodide (N744), is a cationic thiacarbocyanine dye that inhibits recombinant tau filament formation when present at submicromolar concentrations. To prepare dosing regimens for testing N744 activity in biological models, its full concentration-effect relationship in the range 0.01-60muM was examined in vitro by electron microscopy and laser light scattering methods. Results revealed that N744 concentration dependence was biphasic, with fibrillization inhibitory activity appearing at submicromolar concentration, but with relief of inhibition and increases in fibrillization apparent above 10muM. Therefore, fibrillization was inhibited 50% only over a narrow concentration range, which was further reduced by filament stabilizing modifications such as tau pseudophosphorylation. N744 inhibitory activity also was paralleled by changes in its aggregation state, with dimer predominating at inhibitory concentrations and large dye aggregates appearing at high concentrations. Ligand dimerization was promoted by the presence of tau protein, which lowered the equilibrium dissociation constant for dimerization more than an order of magnitude relative to controls. The results suggest that ligand aggregation may play an important role in both inhibitory and disinhibitory phases of the concentration-effect curve, and may lead to complex dose-response relationships in model systems.</AbstractText>"}

The present study examines responses to the 28-item Dementia Behaviour Disturbance Scale (DBD; Baumgarten, Becker, &amp; Gauthier, 1990) among a national sample of persons with dementia (PWD) in Canada. A 3-factor solution appears to best reflect DBD responses for both institutionalized and community-dwelling PWD. This finding is notable given that the former was significantly more impaired and presented with significantly greater levels of behavioural disturbance. Support for the factorial validity of these constructs is provided relative to caregiver burden and depressive symptomatology. Of note, only 14 of 28 DBD items were retained in our analyses; on this basis, we propose the use of an abridged version of the scale. These findings can be generalized with greater confidence given the random and representative nature of the PWD and caregiver samples.</AbstractText>"}

Locomotion acutely stimulated by the mGlu5 antagonist [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP)] was absent in mGlu5 knock-out (KO) mice and was potentiated by an A2A antagonist KW-6002 [(E)-1,3-diethyl-8-(3,4-dimethoxystyryl)-7-methylxanthine], both in normal and in dopamine-depleted (reserpinized) mice.

In contrast, motor stimulation by a D1 dopamine agonist was not attenuated in the KO mice. The A2A receptor dependence of MPEP-induced motor stimulation was investigated further using a postnatal forebrain-specific conditional (Cre/loxP system) KO of the A2A receptor. MPEP loses the ability to stimulate locomotion in conditional KO mice, suggesting that this mGlu5 antagonist effect requires the postdevelopmental action of striatal A2A receptors. The potentiation of mGlu5 antagonist-induced motor stimulation by an A2A antagonist and its dependence on both D2 and forebrain A2A receptors highlight the functional interdependence of these receptors.

In contrast to YAC128 mice, the R6/1 mouse model of HD, which expresses exon 1 of mutant htt, exhibits non-selective, widespread atrophy along with non-selective nuclear detection of mutant htt at 10 months of age. Our findings suggest that selective nuclear localization of mutant htt may contribute to the selective degeneration in HD and that appropriately regulated expression of full-length mutant htt in YAC128 mice results in a pattern of degeneration remarkably similar to human HD.</AbstractText>"}

The current working hypothesis is that polyglutamine diseases are caused by misfolding and aggregation of the proteins with a process dictated by the polyglutamine tracts, although increasing evidence suggests an involvement of the protein context in modulating these properties. Here, we show that the AXH domain of ataxin-1, the protein involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type-1, is the region responsible for the transcriptional repression activity of ataxin-1 and participates in protein aggregation. In vitro, the isolated domain undergoes a conformational transition towards a beta-enriched structure associated with aggregation and amyloid fibre formation spontaneously and without need for destabilizing conditions. Using a transfected cell line, we demonstrate that, while determined by polyglutamine expansion, ataxin-1 aggregation is noticeably reduced by deletion of AXH or by replacement with the homologous sequence from the transcription factor HBP1, which has no known tendency to aggregate. These results provide the first direct evidence of an involvement of a region other than the polyglutamine tract in polyglutamine pathologies.</AbstractText>"}

Conversely, inactivation of Gsk3beta by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt is an important neuroprotective mechanism. Previous studies have shown that agonist activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can increase neuronal survival and prevent apoptosis. However, little is known about the signaling pathways that couple mGluR5 to neuroprotection. In this report, we investigated whether activation of the PI3K/Akt/Gsk3beta pathway, which has been shown to have an important neuroprotective mechanism, is required for mGluR5 activation mediated neuroprotection against beta-amyloid. We found that brief incubations of mouse hippocampal slices with (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) resulted in increased phosphorylation of Akt and Gsk3beta. The PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, blocked the DHPG-induced increased phosphorylation of Akt and Gsk3beta. Similar results were observed in rat primary hippocampal cultures. Finally, we found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 can block (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) mediated neuroprotection against beta-amyloid. Thus, these findings suggest that mGluR5 can modulate the PI3K/Akt/Gsk3beta pathway in the hippocampus, and that modulation of this signaling pathway can reverse beta-amyloid-induced neuronal toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

To determine specificity of these changes for ND, we extended the scope of our investigation to three neurological conditions that do not result in neurodegeneration (non-ND).

Increased phosphorylation of NR2B Tyr-1472 was observed after 24 h of exposure of neurons to 600 pm gp120. This effect occurred only when neurons were treated in the presence of glial cells and was abolished by the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Gp120-induced phosphorylation of NR2B resulted in a sustained elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) in neurons and in a significant increase of NR2B binding to PSD95. Increased intracellular Ca(2+) was prevented by 10 mum ifenprodil, that selectively inhibits receptors containing the NR2B, by interleukin-1ra and by Ca-pYEEIE, a Src family SH2 inhibitor peptide. These last two inhibitors, prevented also NR2B binding to PSD95. Finally, gp120 reduced by 35% of the total PSD95 positive spine density after 48 h of treatment and induced by 30% of the neuronal death. Again, both of these effects were blocked by Ca-pYEEIE. Altogether, our data show that gp120 releasing interleukin-1beta from glia increases tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to the sensitization of the receptor increasing its function and synaptic localization.

This glycoprotein differs in secondary structure from its normal, cellular isoform PrPC, which is physiologically expressed mostly by neurons. Scrapie is a prion disease first described in the 18th century in sheep and goats, and has been established as a model in rodents to study the pathogenesis and pathology of prion diseases. Assuming a multitude of molecular parameters change in the tissue in the course of the disease, FTIR microspectroscopy has been proposed as a valuable new method to study and identify prion-affected tissues due to its ability to detect a variety of changes in molecular structure and composition simultaneously. This paper reviews and discusses results from previous FTIR microspectroscopic studies on nervous tissue of scrapie-infected hamsters in the context of histological and molecular alterations known from conventional pathogenesis studies. In particular, data from studies reporting on disease-specific changes of protein structure characteristics, and also results of a recent study on hamster dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are discussed. These data include an illustration on how the application of a brilliant IR synchrotron light source enables the in situ investigation of localized changes in protein structure and composition in nervous cells or tissue due to PrPSc deposition, and a demonstration on how the IR spectral information can be correlated with results of complementary studies using immunohistochemistry and x-ray fluorescence techniques. Using IR microspectroscopy, some neurons exhibited a high accumulation of disease-associated prion protein evidenced by an increased amount of beta-sheet at narrow regions in or around the infected nervous cells. However, not all neurons from terminally diseased hamsters showed PrPSc deposition. Generally, the average spectral differences between all control and diseased DRG spectra are small but consistent as demonstrated by independent experiments. Along with studies on the purified misfolded prion protein, these data suggest that synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy is capable of detecting the misfolded prion protein in situ without the necessity of immunostaining or purification procedures.</AbstractText>"}

Possible rationalizations include cell replacement, trophic factors delivery, and immunomodulation. Cell replacement theory is based on the idea that replacement of degenerated neural cells with alternative functioning cells induces long-lasting clinical improvement. It is reasoned that the transplanted cells survive, integrate into the endogenous neural network, and lead to functional improvement. Trophic factor delivery presents a more practical short-term approach. According to this approach, MSC effectiveness may be credited to the production of neurotrophic factors that support neuronal cell survival, induce endogenous cell proliferation, and promote nerve fiber regeneration at sites of injury. The third potential mechanism of action is supported by the recent reports claiming that neuroinflammatory mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, inhibiting chronic inflammatory stress might explain the beneficial effects induced by MSC transplantation. Here, we assemble evidence that supports each theory and review the latest studies that have placed MSC transplantation into the spotlight of biomedical research.</AbstractText>"}

However non-selective blockade of COX was found to have pro-inflammatory properties, because they have the ability to alter the plasma glucocorticoid levels that play a critical role in the control of the innate immune response. The present study investigated the role of non-selective (ketorolac or indomethacin) or specific inhibitors of COX-1 (SC-560) and COX-2 (NS-398) in these effects. Mice challenged systemically with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited a robust hybridization signal for numerous inflammatory genes in vascular-associated cells of the brain and microglia across the cerebral tissue. Ketorolac, indomethacin and NS-398 significantly increased the ability of LPS to trigger such an innate immune response at time 3 h post challenge, whereas SC-560 failed to change gene expression in the brain of animals treated with the endotoxin. These data together with the crucial role of COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the increase of glucocorticoids during systemic immune stimuli provide evidence that inhibition of this pathway results in an exacerbated early innate immune reaction. This may have a major impact on the use of these drugs in diseases where inflammation is believed to be a contributing and detrimental factor.</AbstractText>"}

The spatial memory was assessed using the Morris (water maze) test; the immunological status was characterized by ELISA with antibodies to prefibrillar beta-amyloid(25-35), S100b protein, and protofilaments of equine lysozyme, which are the molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The control (sham-operated) animals during the Morris test preferred a sector where the safety platform was placed during the learning session. Bulbectomized animals treated with saline failed to recognize this sector, while bulbectomized animals treated with noopept (0.01 mg/kg for 21 days) restored this predominance, thus demonstrating the improvement of the spatial memory. These animals also demonstrated an increase in the level of antibodies to beta-amyloid(25-35)--the effect, which was more pronounced in the sham-operated than in bulbectomized mice. The latter demonstrated a profound decrease of immunological reactivity in a large number of tests. Noopept, stimulating the production of antibodies to beta-amyloid(25-35), can attenuate the well-known neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid.

Dominant mutations in the human SPG4 gene, encoding spastin, are responsible for the most frequent form of HSP. Spastin is an ATPase that binds microtubules and localizes to the spindle pole and distal axon in mammalian cell lines. Furthermore, its Drosophila homolog, Drosophila spastin (Dspastin), has been recently shown to regulate microtubule stability and synaptic function at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Here we report the generation of a spastin-linked HSP animal model and show that in Drosophila, neural knockdown of Dspastin and, conversely, neural overexpression of Dspastin containing a conserved pathogenic mutation both recapitulate some phenotypic aspects of the human disease, including adult onset, locomotor impairment, and neurodegeneration. At the subcellular level, neuronal expression of both Dspastin RNA interference and mutant Dspastin cause an excessive stabilization of microtubules in the neuromuscular junction synapse. In addition, we provide evidence that administration of the microtubule targeting drug vinblastine significantly attenuates these phenotypes in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that loss of spastin function elicits HSP-like phenotypes in Drosophila, provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of spastin mutations, and raise the possibility that therapy with Vinca alkaloids may be efficacious in spastin-associated HSP and other disorders related to microtubule dysfunction.</AbstractText>"}

Our detailed understanding of the molecular processes that mediate mitochondrial gene expression and the structure-function relationships of the OXPHOS components could be greatly improved if we were able to transfect mitochondria and manipulate mtDNA in vivo. Increasing our knowledge of this process is not merely of fundamental importance, as mutations of the mitochondrial genome are known to cause a spectrum of clinical disorders and have been implicated in more common neurodegenerative disease and the ageing process. In organellar or in vitro reconstitution studies have identified many factors central to the mechanisms of mitochondrial gene expression, but being able to investigate the molecular aetiology of a limited number of cell lines from patients harbouring mutated mtDNA has been enormously beneficial. In the absence of a mechanism for manipulating mtDNA, a much larger pool of pathogenic mtDNA mutations would increase our knowledge of mitochondrial gene expression. Colonic crypts from ageing individuals harbour mutated mtDNA. Here we show that by generating cytoplasts from colonocytes, standard fusion techniques can be used to transfer mtDNA into rapidly dividing immortalized cells and, thereby, respiratory-deficient transmitochondrial cybrids can be isolated.

In isolated cells, such toxicity has been shown to result from increased membrane permeability with disruption of ion homeostasis and oxidative stress. Here we microinjected into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis of rat brains aggregates of an Src homology 3 domain and the N-terminal domain of the prokaryotic HypF, neither of which is associated with amyloid disease. Prefibrillar aggregates of both proteins, but not their mature fibrils or soluble monomers, impaired cholinergic neuron viability in a dose-dependent manner similar to that seen in cell cultures.

Caspases, members of the cysteine protease family, are known to be critical effectors in central nervous system cellular apoptosis. More recently, the calcium-dependent proteases, calpains, have been implicated in cellular apoptotic processes. Indeed, several members of the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulators, nuclear transcription factors (p53) and caspases themselves are processed by calpains. Progressive regional loss of neurons underlies the irreversible pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease in adult brain. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular plaques of amyloid-beta peptide aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau leading to apoptotic cell death. In this review, we summarize the arguments showing that calpains modulate processes that govern the function and metabolism of these two key proteins in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. To conclude, this article reviews our understanding of calpain-dependent apoptotic neuronal cell death and the ability of these proteases to regulate intracellular signaling pathways leading to chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Further research on these calpain-dependent mechanisms which promote or prevent cell apoptosis should help us to develop new approaches for preventing and treating neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Many novel interaction pairs such as valosin-containing protein/autocrine motility factor receptor, CHIP/caytaxin, or amphiphysin II/DLP4 were identified and subsequently confirmed by pull-down, two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, assays were performed to validate the interactions functionally.

Termination of synaptic glutamate transmission and the prevention of excitotoxicity depend on rapid removal of glutamate by high affinity Na+-dependent transporters. The astroglial transporter GLT1 is the predominant subtype, responsible for the bulk of extracellular clearance and for limiting excitotoxicity. This protein is crucial in the prevention of chronic glutamate neurotoxicity, and is markedly decreased in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent studies have shown that GLT1 expression can be induced in vitro and in vivo by various factors, but little is known about the signaling pathways mediating its regulation. The FK506-binding protein (FKBP) immunophilins are ubiquitous cytosolic proteins, concentrated in neural tissue (neuroimmunophilins). GPI-1046 is a synthetic, nonimmunosuppressive derivative of FK506 shown to exert neuroprotective and neuroregenerative actions in several systems. In the present study, we demonstrated that GPI-1046 induces selective expression of GLT1 in vitro and in vivo, associated with a marked increase in DHK-sensitive Na+-dependent glutamate transport. Furthermore, treatment with GPI-1046 was shown to protect motor neurons in an in vitro model of chronic excitotoxicity, and to prolong the survival of transgenic ALS mice.

It is a progressive, incurable disease whose predominant clinical manifestation is memory loss, and which always ends in death. The classic neuropathological diagnostic markers for AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but our understanding of the role that these features of AD play in the etiology and progression of the disease remains incomplete. Research over the last decade has revealed that cell cycle abnormalities also represent a major neuropathological feature of AD. These abnormalities appear very early in the disease process, prior to the appearance of plaques and tangles. Growing evidence suggests that neuronal cell cycle regulatory failure, leading to apoptosis, may be a significant component of the pathogenesis of AD. A number of signaling pathways with the potential to activate aberrant cell cycle re-entry in AD have been described. The relationships among these signaling cascades, which involve the amyloid precursor protein (APP), cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), and the cell cycle protein Pin1, have not yet been fully elucidated, but details of the individual pathways are beginning to emerge. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge with respect to specific neuronal signaling events that are thought to underlie cell cycle regulatory failure in AD brain. The elements of these pathways that represent potential new therapeutic targets for AD are described. Drugs and peptides that can inhibit molecular steps leading to AD neurodegeneration by intervening in the activation of cell cycle re-entry in neurons represent an entirely new approach to the development of treatments for AD.</AbstractText>"}

The possibility of determining the genetic status of an at-risk person for the disorder which run in his family raises questions because of the absence of preventive and curative treatments in most instances. In addition, being carrier does not tell you when the disease will start and how it will evolve, impairing the possibilities of planning the future. A pluridisciplinary approach to predictive testing with care before, during and after the test taking into account the medical, social and psychological aspects of the disease is good practice. At the present time, only a minority of at-risk individuals request presymptomatic testing and almost 50 % do not pursue until the results. The consequences of the test may be harmful, more frequently after an unfavorable than after a favorable result. Although the motivations and the outcome in terms of request for prenatal testing after a carrier result are different in Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias, our experience underlines the benefit of pluridisciplinary care and of time for decision taking. For other disorders like familial Alzheimer's disease, or familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the experience in presymptomatic testing is still limited but the situation seems similar to Huntington's disease because of the presence of dementia. It will be interesting to study the motivations and the outcome of the tests in disorders like autosomal dominant spastic paraplegias which usually do not reduce the life expectancy. Nevertheless, the overall situation might change greatly when efficient treatments will become available in these disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Neurons expressing nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS-I), which is upregulated in many human chronic neurodegenerative diseases, are highly susceptible to neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that chronic production of NO in damaged neurons may increase their intrinsic excitability via modulation of resting or 'leak' K+ currents. Peripheral XIIth nerve injury in adult rats induced de novo NOS-I expression and an increased incidence of low-threshold motor units, the latter being prevented by chronic inhibition of the neuronal NO/cGMP pathway. Accordingly, sustained synthesis of NO maintained an enhanced basal activity in injured motoneurons that was slowly reverted (over the course of 2-3 h) by NOS-I inhibitors. In slice preparations, persistent, but not acute, activation of the NO/cGMP pathway evoked a robust augment in motoneuron excitability independent of synaptic activity. Furthermore, chronic activation of the NO/cGMP pathway fully suppressed TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ (TASK) currents through a protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent mechanism. Finally, we found evidence for the involvement of this long-term mechanism in regulating membrane excitability of motoneurons, because their pH-sensitive currents were drastically reduced by nerve injury. This NO/cGMP/PKG-mediated modulation of TASK conductances might represent a new pathological mechanism that leads to hyperexcitability and sensitizes neurons to excitotoxic damage.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important opportunistic pathogen infecting the central nervous system, where it may remain latent for life, following transplacental transmission. Cyclosporine (Cs), an immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation, where its use is associated with CMV reactivation, suppressed murine CMV (MCMV) infection in cultured NSPCs but not in fibroblasts. This activity of Cs appears to be mediated via cyclophilin (CyP) rather than via calcineurin. First, the calcineurin-specific inhibitor FK506 failed to suppress replication. Second, the CyP-specific inhibitor NIM811 strongly suppressed replication in NSPC. NSPCs maintained in the presence of NIM811 retained viral genomes for several weeks without detectable viral gene expression or obvious deleterious effects. The withdrawal of NIM811 reactivated viral replication, suggesting that the inhibitory mechanism was reversible. Finally, inhibition of endogenous CyP A (CyPA) by small interfering RNA also inhibited replication in NSPCs. These results show that MCMV replication depends upon cellular CyPA pathways in NSPCs (in a specific cell type-dependent fashion), that CyPA plays an important role in viral infection in this cell type, and that inhibition of viral replication via CyP leads to persistence of the viral genome without cell damage.

In this paper, focusing mainly on the research consent context, we examine the idea that persons suffering from neurodegenerative disorders may retain significant abilities-including sufficient capacity for delegating one's authority for giving consent to research-even if they are not capable of giving independent consent themselves.

Among the symptoms of the CLN1 disease are accumulation of autofluorescent lysosomal storage bodies in neurons and other cell types, seizures, motor and cognitive decline, blindness, and premature death. Development of an effective therapy for this disorder will be greatly assisted by the availability of suitable animal models. A mouse PPT-1 gene knockout model has recently been generated. Studies were performed to determine whether the mouse model exhibits ocular features of the human CLN1 disorder. A progressive accumulation of autofluorescent storage material in all layers of the retina was observed in the PPT-1 knockout mice. Accompanying the storage body accumulation was a modest loss of cells with nuclei in the outer and inner nuclear layers. As indicated by electroretinogram (ERG) responses, retinal function was only mildly impaired at 4 months of age but was severely impaired by 8 months, despite only modest changes in retinal morphology. The pupillary light reflex (PLR), on the other hand, was exaggerated in the knockout mice. The apparent anomaly between the ERG and the PLR findings suggests that disease-related PLR changes may be due to changes in extraocular signal processing. The pronounced ocular phenotype in the PPT-1 knockout mice makes these animals a good model for testing therapeutic interventions for treatment of the human CLN1 disorder.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The purpose of this Forum review is to discuss the possibility that highly nucleophilic cysteine thiolate groups within catalytic triads of synaptic proteins represent specific and necessary targets for electrophilic neurotoxicants. Most of these toxicants share the ability to adduct or otherwise modify nucleophilic sulfhydryl groups. It is also now recognized that synaptic activity is regulated by the redox state of certain cysteine sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Electrophilic neurotoxicants might, therefore, produce synaptic toxicity by modifying these thiols. Because most proteins contain cysteine residues, target specificity is an issue that significantly detracts from the mechanistic validity of this hypothesis. However, recent research indicates that these thiolates are receptors for the endogenous nitric oxide (NO) pathway and that subsequent reversible S-nitrosylation finely regulates a broad spectrum of synaptic activities. We hypothesize that electrophilic neurotoxicants selectively adduct/derivatize NO-receptor thiolates in catalytic triads and that the resulting loss of fine gain control impairs neurotransmission and produces neurotoxicity. This proposal has mechanistic implications for a large class of electrophilic chemicals used in the agricultural and industrial sectors. In addition, research based on this hypothesis could provide mechanistic insight into neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease that presumably involve endogenous production of neurotoxic electrophiles (e.g., acrolein, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal). The proposed mechanism of electrophilic neurotoxicants represents a new and exciting experimental framework for mechanistic research in human neuropathological conditions associated with toxicant exposure or disease-based processes.</AbstractText>"}

However, as we review here, recent advances have blurred this distinction. On the one hand, the classical inflammatory diseases of the brain also exhibit profound and early neurodegenerative features - remarkably, it has been known for more than a century that neuronal damage is a key feature of multiple sclerosis pathology, yet this was neglected until very recently.

Here we focused on the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in Huntington's disease (HD). We assayed peripheral lymphocytes from HD patients and healthy controls, and found that the activity of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), was dramatically decreased (down to less than 10%) in HD compared to healthy subjects. Concomitantly, the endogenous levels of AEA were approximately 6-fold higher in HD versus healthy lymphocytes, while the other elements of the endocannabinoid system were not affected by HD. Low FAAH activity in HD lymphocytes was not due to down-regulation of protein expression, but rather to blockage of enzyme activity by a cytosolic and irreversible inhibitor. Finally, pre-HD patients showed defective FAAH activity, as did the brain of HD patients compared with healthy controls. Taken together, our data indicate that FAAH activity in lymphocytes mirrors some of the metabolic changes which take place in the brain, it is a measurable non-genetic peripheral marker that segregates with the HD mutation, and it might serve as a target to test chemicals active on the widespread toxic effects of the mutant protein.</AbstractText>"}

Thus far, the definitive diagnosis of these dementias can only be confirmed at post-mortem. However, it is known that the loss of smell (anosmia) is an early symptom in patients who develop dementia, and the use of the smell test has been proposed as an early diagnostic procedure. The aim of this study was to understand further the extent of Lewy pathology in the olfactory system of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Post-mortem tissue from 250 subjects was obtained from the OPTIMA brain bank. Five areas of the olfactory pathway were examined by immunolabelling for alpha-synuclein - a major component of Lewy pathology: the olfactory tract/bulb (n = 79), the anterior olfactory nucleus in the lateral olfactory gyrus (n = 193), the region of olfactory projection to the orbito-frontal cortex (n = 225), the hippocampus (n = 236) and the amygdala (n = 201). Results show that Lewy pathology affects different parts of the olfactory pathways differentially, suggesting a specific pattern of development of pathology. Clinical Parkinson's disease is most likely to be identified if the orbito-frontal cortex is affected, while the diagnosis is less likely if the pathology is restricted to the olfactory bulb or tract. These results suggest that pathology in the olfactory bulb and tract occurs prior to clinical signs of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the results presented here provide further evidence supporting the possible value of a smell test to aid the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Two independent genes responsible for this neurodegenerative disorder have been identified, but the precise functions of the encoded Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and C2 (NPC2) proteins are not yet known. We developed a cell-free assay for measuring intermembrane lipid transport and examined the ability of bovine NPC2 (bNPC2) for intermembrane cholesterol transfer. NPC2 specifically extracts cholesterol from phospholipid bilayers and catalyzes intermembrane transfer to acceptor vesicles in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This transfer activity is dependent on temperature, pH, ionic strength, lipid composition of the model membranes, and the ratio of donor to acceptor vesicles. In model membranes, the presence of the lysosomal anionic phospholipids bis(monooleoylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidyl inositol significantly stimulated cholesterol transfer by NPC2, whereas bis(monomyristoylglycero)phosphate, phosphatidyl serine, and phosphatidic acid had no effect. Moreover, ceramide stimulated cholesterol transfer slightly, whereas sphingomyelin reduced cholesterol transfer rates. With our assay system we identified for the first time the ability of other lysosomal proteins, most notably the GM2-activator protein, to mediate intermembrane cholesterol transfer. This assay system promises to be a valuable tool for further quantitative and mechanistic studies of protein-mediated lipid transfer.</AbstractText>"}

We confirmed previous results showing that a single injection of 250 microg of allopregnanolone on postnatal day 7 significantly extended the life span of Npc1(-/-) mice. This caused a marked difference in the weight curves of the treated mice but no statistical difference in the Rota-Rod performance. T2-weighted MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of treated mice showed values of signal intensity and fractional anisotropy closer to those of wild-type mice than those of untreated Npc1(-/-) mice. Neuropathology showed that day-7 treatment markedly suppressed astrocyte reaction and significantly reduced microglial activation. Furthermore, the steroid treatment also increased myelination in brains of Npc1(-/-) mice. Similar effects of allopregnanolone treatment were observed in Npc1(-/-), mdr1a(-/-) double-mutant mice, which have a deficient blood-brain barrier, resulting in increased steroid uptake. The effects on survival and weight loss of a single injection on day 7 followed by injections every 2 weeks were also evaluated in Npc1(-/-) mice, and the beneficial effects were found to be greater than with the single injection at day 7.

Objective measurement of disease severity is of increasing importance for detecting symptomatic disease, as well as monitoring disease progression and the response to novel therapeutic interventions. Using a newly-developed infra-red scleral oculometer, we measured saccadic latencies and durations in HD patients exhibiting a broad range of symptoms (n=24) and control subjects of comparable ages (n=20) to see whether these parameters might reflect the presence or severity of HD. Latency distributions were characterised by creating reciprobit plots for each subject, whilst parametric statistics were applied to durations. Compared with the control group, we found the HD group had a significantly increased median latency, and early saccades were more prominent. In addition, HD patients exhibited an increased saccadic duration and variability of duration. Using Bayesian (likelihood) analysis, we obtained saccadic support values for the presence of clinical HD, which correlated with the motor Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score in these patients. A sensitivity/specificity analysis of all 44 participants showed that the use of this multivariate support measure was highly successful in predicting HD status, correctly diagnosing 75% of the HD patients, and (95%) of the controls; with a different criterion, these figures were 96 and 15%. Furthermore, we correctly predicted absence of disease in two additional subjects subsequently confirmed to be genetically unaffected. This strongly suggests that multivariate support values derived from saccadic parameters may provide an objective, quantitative biomarker of HD, especially the degree of motor impairment. However, larger longitudinal studies are required to determine whether they can reliably detect the earliest presymptomatic disease, or faithfully reflect disease progression.</AbstractText>"}

As a biological response modifier (BRM), the polysaccharides isolated from P. vulgaris have been shown to up-regulate the immune responses of monocytes/macrophages. However, the immune stimulatory effects seem to contradict its well-known anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that the anti-microbial effects exhibited by the polysaccharides isolated from P. vulgaris encompass both anti-inflammatory and immune stimulatory effects. One of the polysaccharide fractions PV2IV markedly stimulated the production of superoxide and nitrite representing nitric oxide from murine macrophage RAW264.7 and brain macrophage BV2 cells. The amount of nitrite and superoxide produced after PV2IV stimulation was as high as that stimulated by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, PV2IV also increased cellular protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Similar to the effects of a high dose of LPS, the fraction PV2 could trigger activation-induced cell death (AICD) by stimulating caspase-3 activity and reduction of MTT uptake in monocytes/macrophages.

CC4 lacked the agonist properties of cytisine and was a potent antagonist (IC50=220 nM) on nAChRs. Chronic treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 1 mM CC4 for 48 h increased the expression of 3H-epibatidine (3H-Epi; 3-4-fold) or 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin (125I-alphaBgtx; 1.2-fold) sensitive receptors present on the cell membrane and in the intracellular pool. Comparable data were obtained with nicotine or cytisine, but not with carbamylcholine, d-tubocurarine, di-hydro-beta-erythroidine or hexametonium. Immunoprecipitation and immunopurification studies showed that the increase in 3H-Epi-binding receptors was due to the enhanced expression of alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta2beta4 subtypes without changes in subunit mRNA transcription or receptor half-life. The upregulation was not dependent on agonist/antagonist properties of the drugs, and did not concern muscarinic or serotonin receptors. Whole-cell patch clamp analysis of CC4-treated cells demonstrated larger nicotine-evoked inward currents with augmented sensitivity to the blockers alpha-conotoxin MII or methyllycaconitine. In conclusion, chronic treatment with CC4 increased the number of nAChRs containing beta2 and alpha7 subunits on the plasma membrane, where they were functionally active.

Two plastic processes, synaptic remodeling and neurogenesis, have been the subject of numerous studies due to their involvement in the maturation of the nervous system, their prevalence and re-activation in adulthood, and therapeutic relevance. However, most of the research looking for the mechanistic and molecular events underlying synaptogenic phenomena has been focused on the extensive synaptic reorganization occurring in the developing brain. In this stage, a vast number of synapses are initially established, which subsequently undergo a process of activity-dependent refinement guided by target-derived signals that act as synaptotoxins or synaptotrophins, promoting either loss or consolidation of pre-existing synaptic contacts, respectively. Nitric oxide (NO), an autocrine and/or paracrine-acting gaseous molecule synthesized in an activity-dependent manner, has ambivalent actions. It can act by mediating synapse formation, segregation of afferent inputs, or growth cone collapse and retraction in immature neural systems. Nevertheless, little information exists about the role of this ambiguous molecule in synaptic plasticity processes occurring in the adult brain. Suitable conditions for elucidating the role of NO in adult synaptic rearrangement include physiopathological conditions, such as peripheral nerve injury. We have recently developed a crush lesion model of the XIIth nerve that induces a pronounced stripping of excitatory synaptic boutons from the cell bodies of hypoglossal motoneurons. The decline in synaptic coverage was concomitant with de novo expression of the neuronal isoform of NO synthase in motoneurons. We have demonstrated a synaptotoxic action of NO mediating synaptic withdrawal and preventing synapse formation by cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent and, probably, S-nitrosylation-mediated mechanisms, respectively. This action possibly involves the participation of other signaling molecules working together with NO. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a target-derived synaptotrophin synthesized and released postsynaptically in an activity-dependent form, is a potential candidate for effecting such a concerted action. Several items of evidence support an interrelationship between NO and BDNF in the regulation of synaptic remodeling processes in adulthood: i) BDNF and its receptor TrkB are expressed by motoneurons and upregulated by axonal injury; ii) they promote axon arborization and synaptic formation, and modulate the structural dynamics of excitatory synapses; iii) NO and BDNF each control the production and activity of the other at the level of individual synapses; iv) the NO/cGMP pathway inhibits BDNF secretion; and finally, v) BDNF protects F-actin from depolymerization by NO, thus preventing the collapsing and retracting effects of NO on growth cones. Therefore, we propose a mechanism of action in which the NO/BDNF ratio regulates synapse dynamics after peripheral nerve lesion. This hypothesis also raises the possibility that variations in this NO/BDNF balance constitute a common hallmark leading to synapse loss in the progression of diverse neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.</AbstractText>"}

By using a Drosophila model of tauopathy, we studied the relationship between tau phosphorylation and degradation. We showed that in vivo reduction of proteasome activity results in an accumulation of high-molecular-weight forms of hyperphosphorylated tau. We also found that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta-mediated hyperphosphorylated forms of tau are degradable by the proteasomal machinery. Unexpectedly, GSK-3beta inactivation resulted in a very large accumulation of high-molecular-weight species consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau, suggesting that, depending on the kinase(s) involved, tau phosphorylation state affects its degradation differently. We thus propose a model for tauopathies in which, depending on toxic challenges (e.g., oxidative stress, exposure to amyloid peptide, etc.), abnormal phosphorylation of tau by kinases distinct from GSK-3beta leads to progressive accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau oligomers that are resistant to degradation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

These results and our previous observations suggest that NUB1 indeed targets synphilin-1 to the proteasome for its efficient degradation, which, because of the resultant reduction in synphilin-1, suppresses the formation of synphilin-1-positive inclusions.</AbstractText>"}

Hence, HLDF6 not only enhanced allocentric spatial learning and reference memory (water maze) but also improved temporal, spatial and working memory processes in the DMTP behavioural paradigm. Immunoreactivity blotting analysis of HLDF (the protein precursor of HLDF6) was performed and the following rank order of visual intensities from brain structures was noted: hippocampus cerebral cortex cerebellum hypothalamus striatum. Subsequently, we found that the highest absolute levels of HLDF were expressed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex as detected by ELISA. We also demonstrated that HLDF6 enhanced [(3)H]-thymidine and [(14)C]-leucine incorporation into whole brain and hippocampal homogenates (maxima occurring within the range 10 (-12)-10 (-6) M) suggesting that this hexapeptide promoted de novo DNA and protein biosynthesis.

Another isoform arose from a proposed initiation at a leucine codon and was not processed further. The fifth isoform was postulated to arise from an alternative splicing event and was found to encode an inactive protein. Fourteen mutant PanK2 proteins with single amino acid substitutions, associated with either early or late onset disease, were evaluated for activity. The PanK2(G521R), the most frequent mutation in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, was devoid of activity and did not fold properly. However, nine of the mutant proteins associated with disease possessed catalytic activities that were indistinguishable from wild type, including the frequently encountered PanK2(T528M) missense mutation. PanK2 was extremely sensitive to feedback inhibition by CoA thioesters (IC50 values between 250 and 500 nM), and the regulation of the active PanK2 mutants was comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Coexpression of the PanK2(G521R) and wild-type PanK2 did not interfere with wild-type enzyme activity, arguing against a dominant negative effect of the PanK2(G521R) mutation in heterozygous patients. These data described the unique biochemical features of the PanK2 isoforms and suggested that catalytic defects may not be the sole cause for the neurodegenerative phenotype.</AbstractText>"}

There are comparable reports on increases in schizophrenia spectrum disorders following exposure to ionizing radiation as a result of atomic bombing, nuclear weapons testing, the Chernobyl accident, environmental contamination by radioactive waste, radiotherapy, and also in areas with high natural radioactive background. The results of experimental radioneurobiological studies support the hypothesis of schizophrenia as a neurodegenerative disease. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes brain damage with limbic (cortical-limbic) system dysfunction and impairment of informative processes at the molecular level that can trigger schizophrenia in predisposed individuals or cause schizophrenia-like disorders. It is supposed that ionizing radiation can be proposed as a risk factor for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The hypothesis that ionizing radiation is a risk factor for schizophrenia spectrum disorders can be tested using data from the Chernobyl accident aftermath.

Of paramount importance is ridding cells of mutant or post-translationally modified proteins that otherwise tend to aggregate into insoluble complexes and form inclusions. Such inclusions are characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases and implicate protein misfolding and aggregation as common aspects of pathogenesis. In the most common familial form of ALS, mutations in SOD1 promote misfolding of the protein and target it for degradation by proteasomes. Although proteasomes can degrade the mutant proteins efficiently, altered solubility and aggregation of mutant SOD1 are features of the disease and occur most prominently in the most vulnerable cells and tissues. Indeed, lumbar spinal cord of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice show early reduction in their capacity for protein chaperoning and proteasome-mediated hydrolysis of substrates, and motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to aggregation of mutant SOD1. A high threshold for upregulating key pathways in response to the stress of added substrate load may contribute to this vulnerability. The broad spectrum neuroprotective capability and efficacy of some chaperone-based therapies in preclinical models makes these pathways attractive as targets for therapy in ALS, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms governing the regulation of protein chaperones and UPS components would facilitate development of treatments that upregulate these pathways in a coordinated manner in neural tissue without long term toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we investigated whether MAPT gene variants contribute to the pathogenesis process including the age at onset in Japanese PD.

Techniques have been lacking, however, for measuring the different components of microglial activation independently in vivo. We describe a method for measuring microglial proliferation rates in vivo using heavy water (2H2O) labeling, and its application in screening for drugs that suppress neuro-inflammation. Brain microglia were isolated by flow cytometry as F4/80+, CD11b+, CD45(low) cells, and 2H enrichment in DNA was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Basal proliferation rate was approximately 1%/week and systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) markedly increased this rate in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice by MOG(35-55) peptide stimulated proliferation of CD45(low) microglia, which could be distinguished from the proliferation of CD45(high) infiltrating monocytes. Minocycline (45 mg/kg/day, i.p.) inhibited resident microglial proliferation in both the LPS and EAE models. Thirteen drugs were then screened for their ability to inhibit LPS-stimulated microglia proliferation. Female C57BL/6 mice were given LPS (1 mg/kg), and concomitant drug treatment while receiving 2H2O label for 7 days. Among the drugs screened, treatment with isotretinoin dose-dependently reduced LPS-induced microglial proliferation, representing an action of retinoids unknown previously. Follow-up studies in the EAE model confirmed that isotretinoin not only inhibited proliferation of microglia but also delayed the onset of clinical symptoms. In conclusion, 2H2O labeling represents a relatively high-throughput, quantitative, and highly reproducible technique for measuring microglial proliferation, and is useful for screening and discovering novel anti-neuroinflammatory drugs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Evidence is now emerging that some dietary 'antioxidants' influence signaling pathways and the expression of genes relevant in atherosclerosis by mechanisms other than antioxidative ones. By concrete examples we show that (1) vitamin E has gene regulatory functions which might be more important than acting as an antioxidant in vivo, (2) selenium itself is not an antioxidant at all, and even not in general when incorporated into glutathione peroxidases, and (3) a moderate oxidative stress is beneficial rather than detrimental since it can induce defense mechanisms counteracting xenobiotic and oxidative stress.

LRRK2 is the most recently identified familial PD gene, although its role in sporadic disease is unknown. In this study, we have performed the first comprehensive evaluation of common genetic variation within LRRK2 and investigated its contribution to risk of sporadic PD. We first characterized the linkage disequilibrium within LRRK2 using a panel of densely spaced SNPs across the gene. We then identified a subset of tagging-SNPs (tSNP) that capture the majority of common variation within LRRK2. Both single tSNP and tSNP haplotype analyses, using a large epidemiologically matched sporadic case-control series comprising 932 individuals, yielded significant evidence for disease association. We identified a haplotype that dramatically increases disease risk when present in two copies (OR=5.5, 95%CI=2.1-14.0, P=0.0001).

From the early observation that low circulating serum ceruloplasmin levels served as a marker for Wilson's disease to the recent characterization of a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a complete lack of serum ceruloplasmin, the link between Cp and neuropathology has strengthened. The mechanisms associated with these different central nervous system abnormalities are very distinct. In Wilson's disease, a defect in the P-type ATPase results in abnormal hepatic copper accumulation that eventually leaks into the circulation and is abnormally deposited in the brain. In this case, copper deposition results in the neurodegenerative phenotype observed. Patients with autosomal recessive condition, aceruloplasminemia, lack the ferroxidase activity inherent to the multi-copper oxidase ceruloplasmin and develop abnormal iron accumulation within the central nervous system. In the following review ceruloplasmin gene expression, structure and function will be presented and the role of ceruloplasmin in iron metabolism will be discussed. The molecular events underlying the different forms of neurodegeneration observed will be presented. Understanding the role of ceruloplasmin within the central nervous system is fundamental to further our understanding of the pathology observed. Is the ferroxidase function more essential than the antioxidant role? Does Cp help maintain nitrosothiol stores or does it oxidize critical brain substrates? The answers to these questions hold the promise for the treatment of devastating neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It is essential to further elucidate the mechanism of the neuronal injury associated with these disorders.</AbstractText>"}

The measurement of striatal atrophy using the bicaudate ratio on CT scanner images has therefore been used for years to assess disease progression, but this measure only takes into account unidimensional changes in the head of the caudate nucleus. Recently, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), which permits automated statistical comparisons of whole-brain MRI images, has been proposed to quantify striatal atrophy. However, VBM was not originally designed to study subcortical structures, and severe deep brain deformations that occur in HD may hamper the automatic processing of VBM. Here, we validate the use of the optimised protocol of VBM to quantify subcortical atrophy in HD by comparing results obtained with this method to those provided by manual segmentation of subcortical structures. We studied 20 patients with early HD and 12 controls matched for age, sex and handedness using an improved T1-weighted sequence that eased grey matter segmentation. Both manual and automated methods evidenced the dorso-ventral gradient of striatal atrophy, a loss of grey matter in the globus pallidus and the thalamus, and similar correlations between clinical scores and subcortical atrophy. Furthermore, we were able to detect with VBM grey matter loss in the substantia nigra, the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the insular cortex and the premotor and sensorimotor cortices. Finally, VBM provided results consistent with previous post mortem results and proved to be a sensitive biomarker capable of correctly managing subcortical distortions throughout HD patients' brains.</AbstractText>"}

Each neurotrophin is able to bind to the p75NTR and a specyfic Trk tyrosine kinase receptor. Traditional view is that trophic factors are relesed from target cells, retrogradely transported along their axons, and rapidly degraded upon arrival in cell bodies. But several trophic factors can move anterogradely along axons. NGF-responsive cells are known to belong to the hemopoetic-immune system and to populations in the brain involved in neuroendocrine function. The concentration of NGF is elevated in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune states in conjuction with increased accumulation of mast cells. Neurotrophins can also regulate adult nervous system plasticity by promoting neuronal survival and stimulating nerve regrowth following injury.

Conversely, silencing ITSN or inhibiting JNK attenuated aggregate formation. Using a Drosophila model for polyQ repeat disease, we observed that ITSN enhanced polyQ-mediated neurotoxicity. A reciprocal relationship was observed between ITSN and Htt.

In the immune-mediated demyelinating-neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS), only the myelin sheaths of the CNS are lost, while Schwann cell myelin of the PNS remains normal. This, and the finding that Schwann cells can myelinate CNS axons, has focussed interest on Schwann cell transplants to repair myelin in MS. However, the experimental use of these cells for myelin repair in animal models has revealed a number of problems relating to the incompatibility between peripheral glial cells and the CNS glial environment. Here, we have tested whether these difficulties can be avoided by using an earlier stage of the Schwann cell lineage, the Schwann cell precursor (SCP). For direct comparison of these two cell types, we implanted Schwann cells from post-natal rat nerves and SCPs from embryo day 14 (E14) rat nerves into the CNS under various experimental conditions. Examination 1 and 2 months later showed that in the presence of naked CNS axons, both types of cell form myelin that antigenically and ultrastructurally resembles that formed by Schwann cells in peripheral nerves. In terms of every other parameter we studied, however, the cells in these two implants behaved remarkably differently. As expected from previous work, Schwann cell implants survive poorly unless the cells find axons to myelinate, the cells do not migrate significantly from the implantation site, fail to integrate with host oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and form little myelin when challenged with astrocyte-rich environment in the retina. Following SCP implantation, on the other hand, the cells survive well, migrate through normal CNS tissue, interface smoothly and intimately with host glial cells and myelinate extensively among the astrocytes of the retina. Furthermore, when implanted at a distance from a demyelinated lesion, SCPs but not Schwann cells migrate through normal CNS tissue to reach the lesion and generate new myelin. These features of SCP implants are all likely to be helpful attributes for a myelin repair cell. Since these cells also form Schwann cell myelin that is arguably likely to be resistant to MS pathology, they share some of the main advantages of Schwann cells without suffering from the disadvantages that render Schwann cells less than ideal candidates for transplantation into MS lesions.</AbstractText>"}

Analysis of striatal tissue dopamine (DA) and metabolites using HPLC revealed no difference between hMT1 mice and their non-transgenic littermates. Pre-synaptic DA transporters were studied using in vitro autoradiography with [(3)H]mazindol, a ligand for the membrane DA transporter, and [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine, a ligand for the vesicular monoamine transporter. No difference in the density of striatal DA transporter or vesicular monoamine transporter binding sites was observed. Post-synaptic receptors were studied using [(3)H]SCH-23390, a ligand for D(1) class receptors, [(3)H]YM-09151-2 and a ligand for D(2) class receptors. There were again no differences in the density of striatal binding sites for these ligands. Using in vivo microdialysis in awake animals, we studied basal as well as amphetamine-stimulated striatal extracellular DA levels. Basal extracellular DA levels were similar, but the response to amphetamine was markedly attenuated in the hMT1 mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates (253 +/- 71% vs. 561 +/- 132%, p &lt; 0.05, two-way anova). These observations suggest that the mutation in the torsinA protein responsible for DYT1 dystonia may interfere with transport or release of DA, but does not alter pre-synaptic transporters or post-synaptic DA receptors. The defect in DA release as observed may contribute to the abnormalities in motor learning as previously documented in this transgenic mouse model, and may contribute to the clinical symptoms of the human disorder.</AbstractText>"}

Slowly, protein accumulation events increase causing axonopathy, synaptic deterioration, and subsequent cell death. As toxic species accumulate, autophagy-lysosomal protein degradation pathways are activated. Responses include autophagic vacuoles that degrade damaged cellular components and long-lived proteins, as well as enhanced levels of lysosomal hydrolases. Although such changes correlate with neuronal atrophy in age-related neurodegenerative disorders and in related models of protein accumulation, the autophagic/lysosomal responses appear to be compensatory reactions. Recent studies indicate that protein oligomerization/ aggregation induces autophagy and activates lysosomal protein degradation in an attempt to clear toxic accumulations. Such compensatory responses may delay cell death and account for the gradual nature of protein deposition pathology that can extend over months/years in model systems and years/decades in the human diseases. Correspondingly, enhancement of compensatory pathways shifts the balance from pathogenesis to protection. Positive modulation of protein degradation processes represents a strategy to promote clearance of toxic accumulations and to slow the synaptopathogenesis and associated cognitive decline in aging-related dementias.</AbstractText>"}

A growing body of evidence suggests that in familial ALS (FALS) it is the molecular behavior of the metal-depleted SOD1 dimer that leads to a gain of toxic properties by misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation. Structural studies have so far provided static snapshots on the behavior of the wild-type enzyme and some of the FALS mutants. New approaches are required to map out the structural trajectories of the molecule. Here, using our 1.15-A resolution structure of fully metallated human SOD1 and highly parallelized molecular dynamics code on a high-performance capability computer, we have undertaken molecular dynamics calculations to 4,000 ps to reveal the first stages of misfolding caused by metal deletion. Large spatial and temporal fluctuations of the 'electrostatic' and 'Zn-binding' loops adjacent to the metal-binding sites are observed in the apo-enzyme relative to the fully metallated dimer. These early misfolding events expose the beta-barrels of the dimer to the external environment, allowing close interactions with adjacent molecules. Protection of the beta-edge of the protein can be partially restored by incorporating a single Zn molecule per dimer. These calculations reveal an essential step in the formation of the experimentally observed self-aggregations of metal-depleted FALS mutant SOD1.

Patients with ORE frequently harbor PrP aggregates, but other factors may contribute to pathology, as they often present with unexplained phenotypic variability. We created chimeric yeast-mammalian prion proteins to examine the influence of the PrP ORE on prion properties in yeast. Remarkably, all chimeric proteins maintained prion characteristics. The largest repeat expansion chimera displayed a higher propensity to maintain a self-propagating aggregated state. Strikingly, the repeat expansion conferred increased conformational flexibility, as observed by enhanced phenotypic variation. Furthermore, the repeat expansion chimera displayed an increased rate of prion conversion, but only in the presence of another aggregate, the [RNQ+] prion. We suggest that the PrP ORE increases the conformational flexibility of the prion protein, thereby enhancing the formation of multiple distinct aggregate structures and allowing more frequent prion conversion.

We used mutagenesis to change the assembly state of Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. In vitro, the 'Arctic' mutation (AbetaE22G) accelerated Abeta fibrillization but decreased the abundance of nonfibrillar Abeta assemblies, compared with wild-type Abeta. In human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice carrying mutations adjacent to Abeta that increase Abeta production, addition of the Arctic mutation markedly enhanced the formation of neuritic amyloid plaques but reduced the relative abundance of a specific nonfibrillar Abeta assembly (Abeta*56). Mice overexpressing Arctic mutant or wild-type Abeta had similar behavioral and neuronal deficits when they were matched for Abeta*56 levels but had vastly different plaque loads. Thus, Abeta*56 is a likelier determinant of functional deficits in hAPP mice than fibrillar Abeta deposits. Therapeutic interventions that reduce Abeta fibrils at the cost of augmenting nonfibrillar Abeta assemblies could be harmful.</AbstractText>"}

Autophagy was documented in several neurodegenerative diseases, and under stress conditions the autophagic process can lead to cell death (type II programmed cell death). Beclin 1 is a Bcl-2 interacting protein that was previously found to promote autophagy. We have used Beclin 1 protein as a marker for autophagy following traumatic brain injury in mice. We demonstrated a dramatic elevation in Beclin 1 levels near the injury site. Interestingly Beclin 1 elevation starts at early stages post injury (4 h) in neurons and 3 days later in astrocytes. In both cell types it lasts for at least three weeks. Neuronal cells, but not astrocytes, that overexpress Beclin 1 may exhibit damaged DNA but without changes in nuclear morphology. These observations may indicate that not all the Beclin1 overexpressing cells will die. The elevation of Beclin 1 at the site of injury may represent enhanced autophagy as a mechanism to discard injured cells and reduce damage to cells by disposing of injured components.</AbstractText>"}

The discovery of 'classic' mitochondrial diseases where bioenergetic deficiencies were associated with causal mutations or deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generated a search for similar abnormalities in AD samples. At least three-dozen studies since 1992 have failed to find consistent mutational abnormalities in AD mtDNA beyond those associated with aging, with most studies carried out in postmortem brain. Historically, the publication of a new mutation or deletion is followed by other studies that fail to confirm the initial finding. Promising recent findings include heteroplasmic mutations in the D-loop control region. AD brain mtDNA consistently has more oxidative damage beyond that due to aging, providing the potential for generation of mutations/deletions and postgenomic problems with transcriptional regulation. To date no AD brain studies have examined individual neurons to search for clonal expansions of deleted mtDNA's like two recent reports in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra. Cybrid (cytoplasmic hybrid) models, in which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from accessible tissue (platelets) of living AD patients is expressed in replicating human neural cells initially devoid of their own endogenous mtDNA (rho(0) cells) revealed that decreased cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity, increased oxidative stress, increased beta amyloid production, activation of detrimental intracellular signaling and caspases, accelerated mtDNA proliferation, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology and transport can be transmitted through expression of mtDNA from living AD patients. Carrying these cybrid observations into AD brain is necessary to demonstrate any causality of brain mtDNA to contribute to pathogenesis. A novel protein transfection technology that allows transfer of mtDNA into mitochondria of cells ('protofection') will allow this question to be examined. The contribution of altered mtDNA to pathogenesis and progression of AD is suggestive, not proven, and likely very heterogenous.</AbstractText>"}

Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a hallmark of beta peptide induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease. A general change in glucose utilization, increased oxidative stress, and Ca;{2+} deregulation are additional metabolic defects in the AD brain that may also be associated with defective mitochondrial function the result is a cycle of increased mitochondrial dysfunction causing increased oxidative damage until the cellular energy supply falls below the threshold for cellular survival. In a series of studies on the morphological and morphometric estimation of mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease, by electron microscopy we noticed substantial morphological and morphometric changes in the neurons of the hippocampus, the acoustic cortex, the frontal cortex, the cerebellar cortex, the climbing fibers, the thalamus, the globus pallidus, the red nucleus and the locus coeruleus. The morphological alterations consisted of considerable changes of the mitochondrial cristae, accumulation of osmiophilic material, and decrease of their size, in comparison with the normal controls. Mitochondrial alterations were particularly prominent in neurons, which showed loss of dendritic spines and abbreviation of the dendritic arborization. The ultrastructural study of large number of neurons in the thalamus and the red nucleus revealed that the mitochondrial alterations did not coexist with cytoskeletal pathology and accumulation of amyloid deposits, though they were prominent in neurons, which demonstrated fragmentation of the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Morphometric analysis showed that mitochondria are significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between the site and extent of mitochondrial abnormalities and the synaptic alterations suggests an intimate and early association between these features in Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, issues of thrombotic and neoplastic risks must be factored into the design of estrogen alternatives developed to prevent age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, as well as other climacteric symptoms such as hot flush and sleep dysfunction. One strategy to address these issues is to develop molecules that selectively target and activate estrogen mechanisms of action in the brain while avoiding activation of estrogen receptors peripheral to the brain, particularly in reproductive organs. An overview of recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of estrogen action is discussed in the context of designing an efficacious NeuroSERM that will activate cellular, biochemical and genomic events required for the promotion of memory function and neuronal survival. Pharmacological analyses of estrogen receptor subtypes and the case for a membrane-associated estrogen receptor splice variant in mediating these mechanisms are provided along with a summary of the activation profiles of existing clinically relevant estrogen alternatives or SERMs in neurons.

The homeobox transcription factor Pitx3 is similarly and selectively expressed in the same neurons. Pitx3 deficiency in a natural mouse mutant, the aphakia mouse, was correlated with the loss of these neurons and with a deficit in locomotor activity. We now report that the locomotor deficit of aphakia mice is established by 40 days of age and that it can be rescued by injection of l-dopa. We further show that downstream striatal correlates of the midbrain neuronal losses in aphakia mice, as assessed by dopamine transporter binding and expression of dopamine receptors, enkephalin, dynorphin and neurotensin, are highly similar to neuroadaptive responses observed following rapid neurodegeneration induced by neurotoxin administration in adult animals or following the progressive neurodegenerative processes as seen in Parkinson patients. Taken collectively, these data support the idea that the aphakia mice represent a selective model of dopaminergic deficiency that closely resembles the midbrain and striatal neuropathology associated with Parkinson's disease, and this suggests that these mice are a good model to assess therapies for Parkinson's disease as well as to understand the susceptibility of these neurons to neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

The Wnt proteins were initially implicated in viral carcinogenesis experiments associated with mammary tumors, but since this period investigations focusing on the Wnt pathways and their transmembrane receptors termed Frizzled have been advanced to demonstrate the critical nature of Wnt for the development of a variety of cell populations as well as the potential of the Wnt pathway to avert apoptotic injury. In particular, Wnt signaling plays a significant role in both the cardiovascular and nervous systems during embryonic cell patterning, proliferation, differentiation, and orientation. Furthermore, modulation of Wnt signaling under specific cellular influences can either promote or prevent the early and late stages of apoptotic cellular injury in neurons, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes. A number of downstream signal transduction pathways can mediate the biological response of the Wnt proteins that include Dishevelled, beta-catenin, intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Interestingly, these cellular cascades of the Wnt-Frizzled pathways can participate in several neurodegenerative, vascular, and cardiac disorders and may be closely integrated with the function of trophic factors. Identification of the critical elements that modulate the Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway should continue to unlock the potential of Wnt pathway for the development of new therapeutic options against neurodegenerative and vascular diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The hallmark pathologic feature of PD is dopamine deficiency, caused by the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Current treatments for PD mainly address the dopaminergic features of the disease; however they do not modify the progression of neurodegeneration. The need for newer and more effective agents is consequently receiving a great deal of attention. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic factor family, can promote survival of injured dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in the rodent. Postmortem studies have suggested that BDNF deficiency may play a role in PD pathogenesis. This is further supported by the finding that BDNF administration has a therapeutic effect in animal models of PD. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a collection of synthetic polypeptides approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that peripheral GA administration can enhance central BDNF activity and augment neurogenesis. Furthermore, PD has been associated with an inflammatory process in the brain. Animal studies have demonstrated that GA administration has a central anti-inflammatory effect through the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. From the above evidence, GA could act as a potential therapeutic agent for PD by increasing central BDNF and by exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. With the recent finding that GA administration can prevent neuronal loss and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease double-transgenic mice, early GA treatment may also prevent neurodegeneration and manifestations of PD symptoms in subjects with familial Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Pin1 was essential in HeLa cells, while Pin1-deficient mice showed no lethal phenotypes. We here identified a novel murine Pin1 isoform (mPin1L) consisting of the WW domain and the PPIase domain. Murine Pin1L shares 92% sequence identity with the wild-type Pin1 and shows wide tissue distribution with highest levels in mouse testis. The recombinant mPin1L is enzymatically active, but is approximately three times less efficient than Pin1 in catalyzing the cis/trans isomerization. These data suggest that mPin1L may serve as a surrogate for Pin1.

These broad effects on survival and function arise from direct downstream activation of antiapoptotic pathways, inhibition of proapoptotic pathways, and stimulation of functionally important cellular mechanisms including ERK/MAP kinase and CREB. Thus, as a class, growth factors offer the potential to treat neurodegenerative disorders for the first time by preventing neuronal degeneration rather than compensating for cell loss after it has occurred. Different growth factors affect distinct and specific populations of neurons: the first nervous system growth factor identified, nerve growth factor, potentially stimulates the survival and function of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, suggesting that nerve growth factor could be a means for reducing the cholinergic component of cell degeneration in Alzheimer disease. This review will discuss the transition of growth factors from preclinical studies to human clinical trials in Alzheimer disease. The implementation of clinical testing of growth factor therapy for neurologic disease has been constrained by the dual need to achieve adequate concentrations of these proteins in specific brain regions containing degenerating neurons, and preventing growth factor spread to nontargeted regions to avoid adverse effects. Gene therapy is one of a limited number of potential methods for achieving these requirements.</AbstractText>"}

The present study investigated whether TWEAK plays a role in the regulation of the permeability of the neurovascular unit (NVU). We found that intracerebral injection of TWEAK in wild-type mice induces activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in the brain with resultant disruption in the structure of the NVU and increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). TWEAK did not increase MMP-9 activity or BBB permeability when injected into mice genetically deficient in the NF-kappaB family member p50.

The rationale for this indication is strongly related to the physiological and pathological role of glutamate in neurotransmission. Glutamate is an agonist of NMDA, kainate and AMPA (ionotropic) receptors, where its influence on NMDA receptors plays an important role with regard to neuronal plasticity effecting memory and learning. Excessive levels of glutamate result in neurotoxicity, in part by overactivation of NMDA receptors. Memantine acts as an uncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors and therefore compensates for this overactivation. Furthermore, memantine is a neuroprotective agent in various animal models based on both neurodegenerative and vascular processes, as it ameliorates cognitive and memory deficits. Memantine was effective and safe in several clinical studies, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. The compound is completely absorbed after oral intake and undergoes little metabolism.

After cochlear ablation, abnormal microglial activation accompanied by increased neuronal loss within the auditory brainstem occurs in motheaten (me/me) mice deficient in the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. To determine whether abnormally activated microglia contribute to neuronal death in me/me mice, primary microglial cultures from me/me and wild-type mouse cortices were stimulated by the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to evaluate the secretion of the neurotoxic mediators nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Me/me microglia release significantly greater amounts of all three mediators compared with wild-type microglia. However, the increased release of these compounds in microglia lacking SHP-1 does not appear to occur through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 kinase subgroups of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, or increases in NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). These results suggest that abnormal microglial activation and release of neurotoxic compounds may potentiate neuronal death in deafferented cells and can thus potentiate neurodegeneration in the me/me brainstem.

Recently, in vitro display technologies have come to prominence due to the isolation of high-affinity human antibodies by phage display, the development of novel scaffolds for ribosome display, and the discovery of novel protein-protein interactions. In vitro display represents an emerging and innovative technology for the rapid isolation and evolution of high-affinity peptides and proteins. So far, only one clinical drug candidate produced by in vitro display technology has been approved by the FDA for use in humans, but several are in clinical or preclinical testing.

Activation of these receptors by nicotine or endogenously released acetylcholine enhances activity-dependent synaptic plasticity processes. Deficits in the cholinergic system produce impairment of cognitive functions that are particularly relevant during senescence and in age-related neurodegenerative pathologies. In particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and nAChRs in particular regions controlling memory processes such as the cortex and the hippocampus. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in order to examine whether nicotine was able to regulate induction of long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from adult anti-NGF transgenic mice (AD 11), a comprehensive animal model of AD, in which cholinergic deficits due to nerve growth factor depletion are accompanied by progressive Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration. Both AD 11 and wild-type (WT) mice exhibited short- and long-lasting synaptic plasticity processes that were boosted by nicotine. The effects of nicotine on WT and AD 11 mice were mediated by both alpha7- and beta2-containing nAChRs. In the presence of GABA(A) receptor antagonists, nicotine failed to boost synaptic plasticity in AD 11 but not in WT mice, indicating that in anti-NGF transgenic mice GABAergic interneurons are able to compensate for the deficit in cholinergic modulation of glutamatergic transmission. This compensation may occur at different levels and may involve the reorganization of the GABAergic circuit. However, patch-clamp whole-cell recordings from principal cells failed to reveal any change in spontaneous release of GABA following pressure application of nicotine to nearby GABAergic interneurons. Together, these experiments indicate that in AD 11 mice a rearrangement of the GABAergic circuit can 'rescue' nicotine-induced potentiation of synaptic plasticity. This may be relevant for developing proper therapeutic tools useful for the treatment of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Repeat instability has been extensively studied in bacterial plasmids, where repeats undergo deletion at high rates.

In strain AB1157, deletion rates for 25-60 (CAG) x (CTG) repeats integrated in the chromosome ranged from 6.88 x 10(-9) to 1.33 x 10(-10), or approximately 6,300 to 660,000-fold lower than in plasmid pBR325. In contrast to the situation in plasmids, deletions occur at a higher rate when (CTG)(43), rather than (CAG)(43), comprised the leading template strand, and complete rather than partial deletions were the predominant mutation observed. Repeats were also stable on long term growth following multiple passages through exponential and stationary phase. Mutations in priA and recG increased or decreased deletion rates, but repeats were still greatly stabilized in the chromosome. The remarkable stability of (CAG)(n) x (CTG)(n) repeats in the E. coli chromosome may result from the differences in the mechanisms for replication or the probability for recombination afforded by a high plasmid copy number. The integration of (CAG)(n) x (CTG)(n) repeats into the chromosome provides a model system in which the inherent stability of these repeats reflects that in the human genome more closely.</AbstractText>"}

While physiological concentrations of E2 have consistently been shown to be protective in vivo, direct protection of neurons remains controversial, suggesting that while direct protection of neurons may occur in some instances, an alternative or parallel pathway for protection may exist which could involve another cell type in the brain. In the present review, we summarize the data in support of a possible role for astrocytes in the mediation of neuroprotection by E2. We also summarize the data suggesting a non-classical estrogen receptor may underlie some of the protective effects of E2 by activating cellular signaling pathways, such as extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. A possible indirect pathway involving astrocytes may act in concert with the proposed direct pathway to achieve a widespread, global protection of both ER positive and negative neurons.</AbstractText>"}

Mouse models of ALS, such as one carrying the G93A mutant of the human Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase gene[SOD1(G93A)], develop motor neuron pathology and clinical symptoms similar to those observed in ALS patients. There is compelling evidence that both direct and indirect glutamate toxicity contribute to the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration. However, the therapeutic effect of various glutamate receptor antagonists has not been clearly demonstrated. Memantine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It has been shown to protect neurons against NMDA- or glutamate-induced toxicity in vitro and in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we have examined the therapeutic efficacy of memantine in an ALS mouse model carrying a high copy number of SOD1(G93A). Memantine treatment significantly delayed the disease progression and increased the life span of SOD1(G93A) mice, from 121.4 +/- 5.5 to 129.7 +/- 4.5 days (P = 0.032). Furthermore, NMDA receptor subunits were reliably detected in the spinal cord of SOD1(G93A) mice and their expression levels were similar to those in the wild-type littermate control. Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of memantine in SOD1(G93A) mice is most probably due to the inhibition of spinal cord NMDA receptors. In view of the long-term usage of memantine for dementia patients, with excellent tolerance and safety, these data suggest that memantine may be used in ALS patients alone or in combination with other therapies to prolong survival.</AbstractText>"}

Dopamine neurons in substantia nigra are the major site of neurodegeneration associated with alpha-synuclein deposition in Parkinson disease. Here we establish transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (TG worms) that overexpresses wild-type or familial Parkinson mutant human alpha-synuclein in dopamine neurons. The TG worms exhibit accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the cell bodies and neurites of dopamine neurons, and EGFP labeling of dendrites is often diminished in TG worms expressing familial Parkinson disease-linked A30P or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein, without overt loss of neuronal cell bodies. Notably, TG worms expressing A30P or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein show failure in modulation of locomotory rate in response to food, which has been attributed to the function of dopamine neurons. This behavioral abnormality was accompanied by a reduction in neuronal dopamine content and was treatable by administration of dopamine.

Toxicity exceeds that of other Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor types and is influenced by agonist binding site mutations, ability to desensitize, and extracellular Ca(2+) levels. Significantly, toxicity also depends on GluR2's constitutive surface trafficking, a function dependent on GluR2 C-terminal domain interaction with NSF, a specialized chaperone. We have exploited the interaction between unedited GluR2 and NSF to reduce GluR2 surface levels.

Alteration of neurotransmitter receptors, particularly glutamate and dopamine receptors, is a pathological hallmark of Huntington's disease. We therefore analyzed neurotransmitter receptors in symptomatic YAC128 Huntington's disease mice. We found significant increases in N-methyl-d-aspartate, AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptor binding, which were not due to increases in receptor subunit mRNA expression levels. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed increased levels of glutamate receptor subunits in synaptic membrane fractions from YAC128 mice. We found no changes in dopamine, GABA or adenosine receptor binding, nor did we see alterations in dopamine D1, D2 or adenosine A2a receptor mRNA levels. The receptor abnormalities in YAC128 transgenic mice thus appear limited to glutamate receptors. We also found a significant decrease in preproenkephalin mRNA in the striatum of YAC128 mice, which contrasts with the lack of change in levels of mRNA encoding neurotransmitter receptors. Taken together, the abnormal and selective increases in glutamate receptor subunit expression and binding are not due to increases in receptor subunit expression and may exert detrimental effects. The decrease in preproenkephalin mRNA suggests a selective transcriptional deficit, as opposed to neuronal loss, and could additionally contribute to the abnormal motor symptoms in YAC128 mice.</AbstractText>"}

Observations here summarized indicate that neuroactive steroids, such as progesterone, testosterone and their reduced metabolites, might represent a promising therapeutic option. Peripheral nerves are able to synthesize and metabolize neuroactive steroids and are a target for these molecules, since they express classical and non-classical steroid receptors. Neuroactive steroids modulate the expression of key transcription factors for Schwann cell function, regulate Schwann cell proliferation and promote the expression of myelin proteins involved in the maintenance of myelin multilamellar structure, such as myelin protein zero and peripheral myelin protein 22. These actions may result in the protection and regeneration of peripheral nerves affected by different forms of pathological alterations. Indeed, neuroactive steroids are able to counteract biochemical, morphological and functional alterations of peripheral nerves in different experimental models of neuropathy, including the alterations caused by aging, diabetic neuropathy and physical injury. Therefore, neuroactive steroids, pharmacological agents able to increase their local synthesis and synthetic ligands for their receptors have a promising potential for the treatment of different forms of peripheral neuropathy.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that Cr(3+) may also benefit cardiovascular disease (CVD) and atypical depression. We have found that cholesterol, a lipid implicated in both CVD and neurodegenerative disorders, also influences cellular glucose uptake. A recent study in our laboratory shows that exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to chromium picolinate (CrPic, 10 nM) induces a loss of plasma membrane cholesterol. Concomitantly, accumulation of intracellularly sequestered glucose transporter GLUT4 at the plasma membrane was dependent on the CrPic-induced cholesterol loss. Since CrPic supplementation has the greatest benefit on glucose metabolism in hyperglycemic insulin-resistant individuals, we asked here if the CrPic effect on cells was glucose-dependent. We found that GLUT4 redistribution in cells treated with CrPic occurs only in cells cultured under high glucose (25 mM) conditions that resemble the diabetic-state, and not in cells cultured under non-diabetic (5.5 mM glucose) conditions. Examination of the effect of CrPic on proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis revealed that the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a membrane-bound transcription factor ultimately responsible for controlling cellular cholesterol balance, was upregulated by CrPic. In addition, ABCA1, a major player in mediating cholesterol efflux was decreased, consistent with SREBP transcriptional repression of the ABCA1 gene. Although the exact mechanism of Cr(3+)-induced cholesterol loss remains to be determined, these cellular responses highlight a novel and significant effect of chromium on cholesterol homeostasis.

The stable expression of the Sec-8H4 intrabodies induces proteasome degradation of endogenous prion protein but does not influence its glycosylation profile and maturation. Moreover, we found a dramatic diverting of PrP(C) traffic from its vesicular secretion and, most importantly, a total inhibition of PrP(Sc) accumulation in NGF-differentiated Sec-8H4 PC12 cells. These results confirm that perturbing the intracellular traffic of endogenous PrP(C) is an effective strategy to inhibit PrP(Sc) accumulation and provide convincing evidences for application of intracellular antibodies in prion diseases.</AbstractText>"}

It was recently shown to induce production of the neurotrophic factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and to rescue neuronal-like PC-12 cells from neurotrophic factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that AS101 improves functional outcome and reduces brain damage in a mouse model of focal ischemic stroke. Both pre-stroke and post-stroke intraperitoneal treatments with AS101 reduced infarct size and edema and improved the neurological function of the animals. AS101 treatments reduced both apoptotic and inflammatory caspase activities, and also inhibited protein tyrosine nitration suggesting that AS101 suppresses oxidative stress. Studies of cultured neurons showed that AS101 confers protection against apoptosis induced by either glucose deprivation or the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal. Moreover, AS101 treatment reduced glutamate-induced intracellular calcium elevation, a major contributor to neuronal death in stroke. As AS101 has an excellent safety profile in humans, our pre-clinical data suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of AS101 in patients suffering from stroke and other neurodegenerative conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Among these modifications, protein nitration is thought to play a critical role in the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases. While previously considered a late-stage epiphenomenon, nitration of protein tyrosine residues appears to be an early event in the lesions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The advent of highly specific biochemical and immunological detection methods reveals that nitration occurs in vivo with biological selectively and site specificity. In fact, nitration of only a single Tyr residue is often sufficient to induce profound changes in the activity of catalytic proteins and the three-dimensional conformation of structural proteins. Presumably, nitration modifies protein function by altering the hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic properties within the targeted protein. Most importantly, however, nitrative injury may represent a unifying mechanism that explains how genetic and environmental causes of neurological disease manifest a singular phenotype. In this review and synthesis, we first examine the pathways of protein nitration in biological systems and the factors that influence site-directed nitration. Subsequently, we turn our attention to the structural implications of site-specific nitration and how it affects the function of several neurodegeneration-related proteins. These proteins include Mn superoxide dismutase and neurofilament light subunit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alpha-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase in Parkinson's disease, and tau in Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Its importance is emphasized by the involvement of oxidative stress in injury to the central nervous system and neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, alpha-TOH transfer protein (TTP), is believed to play a significant role in maintaining the vitamin status but the presence of alpha-TOH in membranes is required but not sufficient to protect the membranes against lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) formation. The lipid-radical theory presented in this review considers the role of two membrane factors--alpha-tocopherol and cytochrome b5; these factors secure the functioning of lipid-radical cycles and the participation of lipid-radical reactions in the key membrane processes. The prominent intermembrane reaction realized via a protein-lipid interaction, during which electron transport from cytochrome b5--located in the outer membrane--to peroxyl radical (LOO*)--located in inner membrane--causes reduction of the peroxyl radical: cyt.b5red + LOO* --&gt; cyt.b5ox + LOO(-). This secures an interaction of alpha-TOH with other intermediate, LOO(- )excepting the LOOH formation. The discussion will be focused on the consequences of ineffective electron transfer to LOO* and excessive oxidative pathway of metabolism of the PUFA (LOO* --&gt; LOOH). Assuming the operation of cytochrome b5/alpha-tocopherol-controlled lipid-radical cycles and considering the role of the cycles in membrane bioenergetics we arrive at a model for effective function of adenine nucleotide translocator and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. This paper summarizes our experimental evidence that the oxidative and non-oxidative pathways of metabolism of PUFA via their respective intermediates occur in the cells. While this fact is not widely appreciated it may be relevant to elucidation of new mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We present information from a series of 1136 consecutive patients presenting with cognitive disorders and show possible significant contribution of toxic environmental and occupational exposures to pathological aging (21% of patients) and interactions of these exposures with common polymorphisms that affect cell injury and inflammation. Such exposures may lower age of onset to same degree as APOE4/4. Common polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E (APOE), hemochromatosis gene (Hfe) and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) are present in up to 40+% of patients and may partially account for differences in clinical syndrome, age of onset and rate of progression. Strategies for the study of these disorders must also consider the role and treatment of common co-morbid illnesses such as alcohol use, nutritional deficiencies, sleep disorders, and pre-existing affective disorder. APOE, Hfe, and AAT genes are expressed in liver tissue and in macrophages and are involved in the host innate immune response to stress, inflammation and infections. Hfe and AAT are involved in iron metabolism and their polymorphisms may contribute to hepatosteatosis and altered homeostasis of lipids (role of APOE), iron, and trace minerals. Some of these responses may be adaptive. Hfe and AAT modulate the apparent effects of toxic exposures on age of onset and progression rate. C282Y polymorphism paradoxically reverses APOE4/4 effect on age of onset. S and Z AAT polymorphisms may attenuate earlier age of onset in persons with toxic or environmental exposure. AAT S or Z polymorphisms are present in 25% of persons with anxiety disorder and 42% of persons with bipolar disorder compared to 10% of control group without pre-existing affective disorder. Common genetic polymorphisms that affect the response to inflammation and cell injury provide a beginning strategy for dissecting neurodegenerative disorders. The effects of APOE, Hfe, and AAT on glucose, lipid, iron and trace mineral homeostasis may affect normal development and aging of the nervous system in addition to their effects on outcome of toxic environmental and occupational exposures and susceptibility and outcome of neurodegenerative illnesses.</AbstractText>"}

Elevation of NSP level in CSF indicates an actual neudegenerative process. Serum levels of NSP are determined by the balance between the elimination of NSP from the brain, on the one hand, and their metabolism and the response of the immune system to the appearance of these autoantigenes in the blood stream, on the other. Basing on their own data on the dynamics of NSP (NSE, GFAR, and MBP) concentrations and the proportions of these proteins in CSF and serum (coefficient of elimination) in rats after ischemic, hypoxic, and autoimmune cerebral lesions, the authors offer an algorithm of pathogenetic evaluation, including, on the one part, a conclusion on the presence or absence of a neurodegenerative process, and, on the other, a conclusion on a normal or lowered rate of NSP elimination (metabolism).

As microglial transformation to an activated state is closely linked to progressive changes in brain disease, the detection of activated microglia can provide information about disease distribution and rate of disease progression. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C](R)-PK11195, a specific ligand of the PBBS, have been used to study systematically microglial activation in vivo. Significant microglial activation is present in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative dementia even at early and possibly preclinical stages of the disease with a spatial distribution reflecting different clinical phenotypes.

Stable dose use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen and vitamin E was allowed, as was the use of most other medications in the treatment of co-morbidities. We demonstrated that atorvastatin treatment produced significantly (P = 0.003) improved performance on cognition and memory after 6 months of treatment (ADAS-cog) among patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

The failure to demonstrate a transfer of cholesterol from the circulation into the brain in humans and experimental animals makes it difficult to explain the link between hypercholesterolemia and AD. In contrast to cholesterol itself, side-chain oxidized cholesterol metabolites such as 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol are able to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Formation of 24S-hydroxycholesterol is the quantitatively most important mechanism for elimination of cholesterol from the brain and we recently demonstrated a significant net uptake of 27-hydroxycholesterol by the brain from the circulation. We have also shown that patients with AD have increased brain levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol, which may affect the production of beta-amyloid in the brain. The levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation are correlated with the levels of cholesterol and the possibility must be considered that the flux of 27-hydroxycholesterol into the brain is the missing link between hypercholesterolemia and Alzheimer's disease.

Two examples of how the structure of apoE4 determines the pathological outcome in neurons include apoE4 potentiation of amyloid beta-induced lysosomal leakage and apoptosis and the proteolytic cleavage of apoE synthesized by neurons. Thus, a new therapeutic target is to identify small molecules to modulate the inherent neuropathological structure of apoE4, i.e. to prevent domain interaction and to convert apoE4 to an apoE3-like molecule. A second therapeutic target is to inhibit the apoE-cleaving enzyme. This would prevent the generation of the reactive carboxyl-terminal fragments of apoE that enter the cytosol, disrupt the cytoskeleton, and cause neurodegeneration. ApoE4 is more susceptible than apoE3 to proteolytic cleavage and is thus more likely to cause detrimental effects in the central nervous system. It is predictable that apoE4 acts through various pathways to cause cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Interactions with metal ions affect dramatically the kinetics of fibrillation of AS in vitro and are proposed to play a potential role in vivo. We recently showed that Cu(II) binds at the N-terminus of AS with high affinity (K(d) approximately 0.1 microM) and accelerates its fibrillation. In this work we investigated the binding features of the divalent metal ions Fe(II), Mn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II), and their effects on AS aggregation. By exploiting the different paramagnetic properties of these metal ions, NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information about the protein-metal interactions at the atomic level. The divalent metal ions bind preferentially and with low affinity (millimolar) to the C-terminus of AS, the primary binding site being the (119)DPDNEA(124) motif, in which Asp121 acts as the main anchoring residue. Combined with backbone residual dipolar coupling measurements, these results suggest that metal binding is not driven exclusively by electrostatic interactions but is mostly determined by the residual structure of the C-terminus of AS. A comparative analysis with Cu(II) revealed a hierarchal effect of AS-metal(II) interactions on AS aggregation kinetics, dictated by structural factors corresponding to different protein domains. These findings reveal a strong link between the specificity of AS-metal(II) interactions and the enhancement of aggregation of AS in vitro. The elucidation of the structural basis of AS metal binding specificity is then required to elucidate the mechanism and clarify the role of metal-protein interactions in the etiology of Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

In this context, we investigated here if the exposure of bovine chromaffin cells to the potent nAChR agonist epibatidine protected against rotenone (30 micromol/L) plus oligomycin (10 micromol/L) (rot/oligo) toxicity, an in vitro model of mitochondrial ROS production. Epibatidine induced a concentration- and time-dependent protection, which was maximal at 3 mumol/L after 24 h. Pre-incubation with dantrolene (100 micromol/L) (a blocker of the ryanodine receptor channel), chelerythrine (1 micromol/L) (a protein kinase C inhibitor), or PD98059 (50 micromol/L) (a MEK inhibitor), aborted epibatidine-elicited cytoprotection. Mitochondrial depolarization, ROS, and caspase 3 active produced by rot/oligo were also prevented by epibatidine. Epibatidine doubled the amount of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a critical cell defence enzyme against oxidative stress. Furthermore, the HO-1 inhibitor Sn(IV) protoporphyrin IX dichloride reversed the epibatidine protecting effects and HO-1 inducer Co (III) protoporphyrin IX dichloride exhibited neuroprotective effects by itself. The results of this study point to HO-1 as the cytoprotective target of nAChR activation through the following pathway: endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release activates the protein kinase C/extracellular regulated kinase/HO-1 axis to mitigate mitochondrial depolarization and ROS production.

It has been long thought that the COX-2-mediated neuronal injury/degeneration is attributed to the increased production of AA-derived prostaglandins. Recent studies show that endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a natural substrate for COX-2, and it can be oxygenated by COX-2 to form prostaglandin glyceryl esters. In this study, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E(2) glyceryl ester (PGE(2)-G), a major COX-2 oxidative metabolite of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, enhanced hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission indicated by the increased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents, and induced neuronal injury/death revealed by the terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining and caspase 3 activation. The actions of PGE(2)-G are not mediated via a cannabinoid receptor 1, but mediated through ERK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IP(3), and NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways. In addition, the PGE(2)-G-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by blockade of the NMDA receptors.

A small proportion, about 2%, is associated with a mutation in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, and mice expressing this mutant gene exhibit a progressive, ALS-like neurodegenerative disease. Studies of these animals, as well as of human post mortem tissue, reveal the presence of multiple pathological processes, including oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial degeneration, alterations in neurofilaments and neurotubules, mitochondrial damage, aggregation of proteins, abnormalities in growth factors, and apoptosis. We propose that alterations in the disposition of zinc ions may be important in the initiation and development of ALS. SOD1 binds zinc, and many of the mutant forms of this enzyme associated with ALS show altered zinc binding. Alterations in the expression of metallothioneins (MTs), which regulate cellular levels of zinc, have been reported in mutant SOD1 mice, and deletion of MTs in these animals accelerates disease progression. Zinc plays a key role in all the pathological processes associated with ALS. Our zinc hypothesis also may help explain evidence for environmental factors in some cases of ALS, such as in the Chamorro tribe in Guam and in the Gulf War.</AbstractText>"}

Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a nontoxic antiulcer drug, has been shown to potently induce HSP expression in various tissues, including the central nervous system. In a cell model of SBMA, GGA increased the levels of Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp105 and inhibited cell death and the accumulation of pathogenic AR. Oral administration of GGA also up-regulated the expression of HSPs in the central nervous system of SBMA-transgenic mice and suppressed nuclear accumulation of the pathogenic AR protein, resulting in amelioration of polyglutamine-dependent neuromuscular phenotypes. These observations suggest that, although a high dose appears to be needed for clinical effects, oral GGA administration is a safe and promising therapeutic candidate for polyglutamine-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, including SBMA.</AbstractText>"}

Neither the precipitating event nor biology underlying the MV infection is understood, nor is their any satisfactory treatment. We report the creation of a transgenic mouse model that mimics the cardinal features of SSPE. This was achieved by initially infecting mice expressing the MV receptor with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Cl 13, a virus that transiently suppressed their immune system. Infection by MV 10 days later resulted in persistent MV infection of neurons. Analysis of brains from infected mice showed the biased U to C hypermutations in the MV M gene and T and B lymphocyte infiltration. These sera contained high titers of antibodies to MV. Thus, a small animal model is now available to both molecularly probe the pathogenesis of SSPE and to test a variety of therapies to treat the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Abnormal inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS), activation of macrophage/microglia and involvement of proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested as primary factors in the pathogenesis of HAD. Impairment of neuronal function and neuronal cell death are believed to be the end pathophysiological result of HAD. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF family of cytokines, was suggested to participate in apoptotic cell death during HAD. As a death ligand, TRAIL was originally thought to target only tumor cells. TRAIL is not typically present in CNS; however, emerging data show that TRAIL can be induced by immune stimuli on macrophage and microglia, major disease effector cells during HAD. Upregulated TRAIL may then cause neuronal apoptosis through direct interaction with TRAIL receptors on neurons or through macrophage death-mediated release of neurotoxins. In this review, we summarize the pivotal role of TRAIL in HAD and TRAIL-initiated intracellular death cascades that culminate in neuronal apoptosis as observed in HAD.</AbstractText>"}

MP immunoregulatory responses include secretion of neurotoxic factors, mobilization of adaptive immunity, and cell chemotaxis. This incites tissue remodelling and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. As disease progresses, MP secretions engage neighboring cells in a vicious cycle of autocrine and paracrine amplification of inflammation leading to tissue injury and ultimately destruction. Such pathogenic processes tilt the balance between the relative production of neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors and to disease progression. The ultimate effects that brain MP play in disease revolves 'principally' around their roles in neurodegeneration. Importantly, common functions of brain MP in neuroimmunity link highly divergent diseases (for example, human immunodeficiency virus type-one associated dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease).

Sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases produces Abeta1-40/42, but beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the major beta-secretase, also generates Abeta11-40/42, and BACE1 overexpression in cultured cells results primarily in secretion of Abeta11-40/42. The ratio of Abeta11-40/42 to Abeta1-40/42 depends on the ratio of BACE1 to APP, and Abeta11-40/42 can be generated from both full-length APP and its carboxy-terminal fragment (C99). Here, we investigated the role of Abeta11-40/42 in the pathogenesis of AD and Down's syndrome (DS) brains. We demonstrated significant amount of Abeta11-42 in DS brains by Western blots. While pyroAbeta11-42-modified Abeta species existed predominantly in mature SP cores in AD brain sections, both unmodified free Abeta11-40 and pyro-modified Abeta11-40 are detected in vascular amyloid deposits by immunohistochemistry. Using novel ELISAs for quantifying free Abeta11-40/42 and pyroAbeta11-40/42, we showed that insoluble Abeta11-42 predominated in extracts of AD and DS brains.

Although little is known about the early functional or ultrastructural changes associated with AD, it has been proposed that a stage of synaptic dysfunction might precede neurodegeneration in the development of this disease. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that underlie such synaptic dysfunction remain largely unknown. Recently we have shown that beta-amyloid (Abeta), the main component of senile plaques, induced a significant decrease in dynamin 1, a protein that plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle recycling, and hence, in the signaling properties of the synapse. We report here that this dynamin 1 degradation was the result of calpain activation induced by the sustained calcium influx mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in hippocampal neurons. In addition, our results showed that soluble oligomeric Abeta, and not fibrillar Abeta, was responsible for this sustained calcium influx, calpain activation, and dynamin 1 degradation. Considering the importance of dynamin 1 to synaptic function, these data suggest that Abeta soluble oligomers might catalyze a stage of synaptic dysfunction that precedes synapse loss and neurodegeneration. These data also highlight the calpain system as a novel therapeutic target for early stage AD intervention.</AbstractText>"}

To study the association between environmental mitochondrial toxin exposure and neurodegeneration, mice were intravitreally microinjected with rotenone in one eye and with the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide in the contralateral eye, as a within-subject control. The retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) of eyes injected with rotenone became significantly thinner than that of the control eyes after 24 h, but not as early as 0.5 h. This reduction was observed using complex I histochemistry and with Nissl staining of cell bodies. After 24 h, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was reduced by 89% and the number of GCL cells was reduced by 21% in rotenone-treated eyes. Cellular morphometric data (soma area, perimeter, and diameter) did not show overall differences, but there was a preferential reduction in the proportion of larger cells. Therefore, the reduction in GCL thickness 24 h after rotenone microinjection could be accounted for by cell loss and nerve fiber shrinkage, but not by overall soma size change. Rotenone-induced degeneration of the ganglion cell layer may be used as a convenient way to (1) evaluate mechanisms and treatments for the neurodegeneration produced by mitochondrial dysfunction and (2) investigate environmental pesticide contributions to neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

It was observed that single-stranded circular DNA induce alpha-helix conformation in alpha-synuclein while plasmid supercoiled DNA has dual effect inducing a partially folded conformation and alpha-helix under different experimental conditions. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein showed a specificity for GC* nucleotide sequence in its binding ability to DNA. The aggregation kinetics data showed that DNA which induced partially folded conformation in alpha-synuclein promoted the fibrillation while DNA which induced alpha-helix delayed the fibrillation, indicating that the partially folded intermediate conformation is critical in the aggregation process. Further, the mechanism of DNA-induced folding/aggregation of alpha-synuclein was studied using effect of osmolytes on alpha-synuclein as a model system. Among the five osmolytes used, Glycerol, trimethylamine-N-oxide, Betaine, and Taurine induced partially folded conformation and in turn enhanced the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. The ability of DNA and osmolytes in inducing conformational transition in alpha-synuclein, indicates that two factors are critical in modulating alpha-synuclein folding: (i) electrostatic interaction as in the case of DNA, and (ii) hydrophobic interactions as in the case of osmolytes. The property of DNA inducing alpha-helical conformation in alpha-synuclein and inhibiting the fibrillation may be of significance in engineering DNA-chip based therapeutic approaches to PD and other amyloid disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Since its initial description twenty years ago, advances in cell and molecular biology along with those in neuroimaging have furthered our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. The clinical and neuropsychological profile of ADC is generally consistent with a 'frontal-subcortical' pattern of injury. Neuropathogenesis is largely driven by indirect mechanisms mediated by infected, or more commonly, immune activated macrophages, which secrete viral and host-derived factors. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a robust in vivo method to measure the inflammatory and neurotoxic events triggered by these factors and their associated signals. Although the use of combined or highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) has significantly improved survival rates, cerebral injury and cognitive impairment remain common events. Factors such as aging and chronic infection will likely impact the course of this disease, its pathogenesis, and treatment.

ROS scavenging activities of intact proteins are weaker than those of misfolded proteins or equivalent concentrations of their constituent amino acids. Protein oxidation and enhanced proteolytic degradation, therefore, have been suggested to cause a net increase in ROS scavenging capacity. However, certain oxidized proteins are poorly handled by cells, and together with possible alterations in the rate of production of oxidized proteins, may contribute to the observed accumulation and damaging actions of oxidized proteins during ageing and in pathologies such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.

Where activated microglia fall in this spectrum seems to be highly dependent on the type of stimulation provided. We begin by addressing the classical roles of peripheral innate immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells, which seem to define the edges of this continuum. We then discuss various types of microglial stimulation, including Toll-like receptor engagement by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, microglial challenge with myelin epitopes or Alzheimer's beta-amyloid in the presence or absence of CD40L co-stimulation, and Alzheimer disease 'immunotherapy'. Based on the wide spectrum of stimulus-specific microglial responses, we interpret these cells as immune cells that demonstrate remarkable plasticity following activation.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (T/C) in intron 2 of CYP46 gene has been found to confer the risk for AD. The water soluble 24(S)-hydroxysterol is the product of the CYP46A1, and elevated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid hydroxysterol concentrations have been found in AD, reflecting increased brain cholesterol turnover or cellular degradation, due to the neurodegenerative process.

All these mechanisms maintain innate immunity. Deficiency in this immunity is sometimes accompanied by frequent bacterial and viral infections. When innate immunity is permanently stimulated and the intensity of the reactions is stronger, these mechanisms may be directed against the host and subsequently stimulate acquired immunity (antibody and cellular immunity). A higher production of cytokines, oxidative stress, and a high production of NO accompany autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. The possible participation of innate immune receptors, cytokines, and other factors in the development of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases is discussed. The importance and possible role of blood-derived microglial cells in the prevention or elimination of amyloid deposits and plaque formation is described. A possible regulatory system, based on the presence of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), receptors of the Tyro-3 family, adenosine and adenosine phosphates, and IL-10, is reviewed.

Hsp90 inhibitors are unique in that, although they are directed towards a specific molecular target, they simultaneously inhibit multiple cellular signalling pathways. By inhibiting nodal points in multiple overlapping survival pathways utilized by cancer cells, combination of an Hsp90 inhibitor with standard chemotherapeutic agents may dramatically increase the in vivo efficacy of the standard agent. Hsp90 inhibitors may circumvent the characteristic genetic plasticity that has allowed cancer cells to eventually evade the toxic effects of most molecularly targeted agents. The mechanism-based use of Hsp90 inhibitors, both alone and in combination with other drugs, should be effective toward multiple forms of cancer. Further, because Hsp90 inhibitors also induce Hsf-1-dependent expression of Hsp70, and because certain mutated Hsp90 client proteins are neurotoxic, these drugs display ameliorative properties in several neurodegenerative disease models, suggesting a novel role for Hsp90 inhibitors in treating multiple pathologies involving neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Autophagy might be involved in some neurodegenerative processes, including lateral amyotrophic sclerosis (SLA). The exact mechanism leading to progressive motor neuron (MN) loss remains unclear, but glutamate-mediated mechanism is thought to be responsible. Previous ultrastructural studies by the authors performed on a model of SLA in vitro, based on chronic glutamate excitotoxicity, revealed a subset of morphological features characteristic to different modes of neuronal death, including autophagic degeneration. The contribution of this pathway of MNs death is evaluated in organotypic cultures of rat lumbar spinal cord chronically exposed to specific glutamate uptake blockers: DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (THA) and L-transpyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC). The study documents the various steps of authophagy in slowly evolving process of MN neurodegeneration. The cells undergoing autophagy usually exhibited sequestration of some parts of cytoplasm with normal and/or degenerated organelles, whereas other parts of cytoplasm as well as neuronal nucleus remained unchanged. The advanced autophagic changes were often associated with other modes of MN death, especially with apoptosis. Numerous MNs revealed apoptotic nuclear features with typical peripheral margination of nuclear chromatin, accompanied by severe autophagic or autophagic-necrotic degeneration of the cytoplasm. These results support the opinion of unclear distinction between different modes of cell death and indicate the involvement of autophagey in MNs neurodegeneration in vitro.</AbstractText>"}

A large proportion of FTD patients (35-50%) have a family history of dementia, consistent with a strong genetic component to the disease. In 1998, mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) were shown to cause familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17q21 (FTDP-17). The neuropathology of patients with defined MAPT mutations is characterized by cytoplasmic neurofibrillary inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, in multiple FTD families with significant evidence for linkage to the same region on chromosome 17q21 (D17S1787-D17S806), mutations in MAPT have not been found and the patients consistently lack tau-immunoreactive inclusion pathology. In contrast, these patients have ubiquitin (ub)-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and characteristic lentiform ub-immunoreactive neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Here we demonstrate that in these families, FTD is caused by mutations in progranulin (PGRN) that are likely to create null alleles. PGRN is located 1.7 Mb centromeric of MAPT on chromosome 17q21.31 and encodes a 68.5-kDa secreted growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes including development, wound repair and inflammation. PGRN has also been strongly linked to tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGRN expression is increased in activated microglia in many neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease. Our results identify mutations in PGRN as a cause of neurodegenerative disease and indicate the importance of PGRN function for neuronal survival.</AbstractText>"}

FTDU-17 patients have consistently been shown to lack a tau-immunoreactive pathology, a feature characteristic of FTD with parkinsonism linked to mutations in MAPT (FTDP-17). Furthermore, in FTDU-17 patients, mutations in MAPT and genomic rearrangements in the MAPT region have been excluded by both genomic sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization on mechanically stretched chromosomes. Here we demonstrate that FTDU-17 is caused by mutations in the gene coding for progranulin (PGRN), a growth factor involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes including tumorigenesis. Besides the production of truncated PGRN proteins due to premature stop codons, we identified a mutation within the splice donor site of intron 0 (IVS0 + 5G &gt; C), indicating loss of the mutant transcript by nuclear degradation. The finding was made within an extensively documented Belgian FTDU-17 founder family. Transcript and protein analyses confirmed the absence of the mutant allele and a reduction in the expression of PGRN. We also identified a mutation (c.3G &gt; A) in the Met1 translation initiation codon, indicating loss of PGRN due to lack of translation of the mutant allele. Our data provide evidence that PGRN haploinsufficiency leads to neurodegeneration because of reduced PGRN-mediated neuronal survival. Furthermore, in a Belgian series of familial FTD patients, PGRN mutations were 3.5 times more frequent than mutations in MAPT, underscoring a principal involvement of PGRN in FTD pathogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

The rapid clinical progression, change in protein conformation, cross-species transmission and massive neuronal degeneration are some key features of this devastating degenerative condition. Although the etiology is unknown, aberrant processing of cellular prion proteins is well established in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Normal cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is highly conserved in mammals and expressed predominantly in the brain. Nevertheless, the exact function of the normal prion protein in the CNS has not been fully elucidated. Prion proteins may function as a metal binding protein because divalent cations such as copper, zinc and manganese can bind to octapeptide repeat sequences in the N-terminus of PrP(c). Since the binding of these metals to the octapeptide has been proposed to influence both structural and functional properties of prion proteins, alterations in transition metal levels can alter the course of the disease. Furthermore, cellular antioxidant capacity is significantly compromised due to conversion of the normal prion protein (PrP(c)) to an abnormal scrapie prion (PrP(sc)) protein, suggesting that oxidative stress may play a role in the neurodegenerative process of prion diseases. The combination of imbalances in cellular transition metals and increased oxidative stress could further exacerbate the neurotoxic effect of PrP(sc).

The aim of this article is to illustrate the practical scientific applications of the 3T system in the neuroradiological filed. From the clinical point of view, we focused on the usefulness of 3T system for the diagnosis of several neurological disorders, such as brain tumors, vascular lesions, hemorrhagic lesions, acute cerebral infarcts and degenerative diseases. The greatest advantage of high-field MR system is a higher signal to noise ratio. This higher spatial resolution can provide precise anatomical information for brain tumor itself and its surrounding structures. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) also benefits from the higher signal to noise ratio and offers useful information for tumor characteristics. Navigation system with diffusion tensor tractgraphy is also available for surgical operation of brain tumors. Parallel imaging enables to improve the quality of tractgraphy by reducing susceptibility artifacts. 3T TOF (time-of-flight) MR angiography (MRA) demonstrates superior depiction of intracranial aneurysms compared with that of 1.5T TOF MRA. 3T TOF MRA is also useful for the evaluation and follow-up of stenoocclusive diseases including moyamoya disease. Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent)-sensitive method for visualizing anatomical features such as small cerebral veins in high detail. Therefore, 3T system has advantages for obtaining detailed, high spatial resolution images of the venous network. SWI is useful for detection of hemorrhagic lesions and early diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic infarcts. SWI also can detect embolus and evaluate functional changes showing dilatation of medullary veins in the area of acute cerebral infarcts. Neuromelanin imaging using 3T system can directly demonstrate the locus ceruleus and substantia nigra by the neuromelanin content and have the potential to become a powerful tool in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders with Parkinsonism. Hyperintense putaminal rim can be often observed in clinically normal subjects on fast spin echo T2-weighted images at 3T system. This finding should not be mistaken for multiple system atrophy. 3T MR system indeed offers new potential because of a substantial increase in signal intensity provided by the higher magnetic field. Routine neuroradiologic imaging would benefit from higher magnetic field.

Our theoretical model of praxis (Buxbaum, 2001) postulates that left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) gesture representations store information about postures and movements of the body and hand for skillful manipulation of familiar objects; in contrast, bilateral fronto-parietal dynamic calculations provide constantly-updated information about the current position and movement of the body and hand for both familiar and novel, transitive and intransitive movements. This account predicts distinct patterns of IM in patients with left IPL damage versus bilateral fronto-parietal involvement. Consistent with predictions, 16 stroke patients with left IPL damage were more impaired with transitive than intransitive gestures, whereas 4 patients with bilateral fronto-parietal damage due to corticobasal degeneration (CBD) were not [F (1, 18) = 8.5 p &lt; .01]. Additionally, the hand posture component of transitive gestures was the most impaired aspect of gesture in CVA, but tended to be the least impaired aspect of gesture in CBD [F (3, 54) = 5.1, p &lt; .005]. Finally, CVA patients were more impaired with transitive hand postures than meaningless or intransitive hand postures, whereas CBD patients showed the opposite pattern. These data indicate that the left IPL mediates representations of skilled hand-object interactions, as distinct from dynamic coding of the body in space, and suggest that the IPL maps between representations of object identity in the ventral stream and spatial body representations mediated by the dorsal system.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, it was first shown that the subunits of K(ATP) channels are expressed in BV-2 cells, and then it was investigated whether K(ATP) channel was involved in regulating inflammatory factor production from BV-2 cells activated by rotenone. It was found that K(ATP) channel was expressed in BV-2 cell and formed by the combination of Kir 6.1 and SUR 2A/2B. K(ATP) channel openers (KCOs) including pinacidil, diazoxide and iptakalim (Ipt) exerted beneficial effects on rotenone-induced morphological alterations of BV-2 cells, decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production and the expression and activity of inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Either glibenclamide or 5-hydroxydecanoate acid (a selective mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker) could abolish the effects of KCOs, suggesting that K(ATP) channels, especially mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoK(ATP) channels), played a crucial role in preventing the activation of BV-2 cells, and subsequently the production of a variety of proinflammatory factors. Therefore, activation of K(ATP) channel might be a new therapeutic strategy for treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Aging changes occur in most brain regions and, in the hippocampus, have been linked to declining cognitive performance in both humans and animals. Age-related changes in hippocampal regions also may be harbingers of more severe decrements to come from neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain aging, AD and impaired function has been difficult because of the complexity of the networks that drive these aging-related changes. Gene microarray technology allows massively parallel analysis of most genes expressed in a tissue, and therefore is an important new research tool that potentially can provide the investigative power needed to address the complexity of brain aging/neurodegenerative processes. However, along with this new analytic power, microarrays bring several major bioinformatics and resource problems that frequently hinder the optimal application of this technology. In particular, microarray analyses generate extremely large and unwieldy data sets and are subject to high false positive and false negative rates. Concerns also have been raised regarding their accuracy and uniformity. Furthermore, microarray analyses can result in long lists of altered genes, most of which may be difficult to evaluate for functional relevance. These and other problems have led to some skepticism regarding the reliability and functional usefulness of microarray data and to a general view that microarray data should be validated by an independent method. Given recent progress, however, we suggest that the major problem for current microarray research is no longer validity of expression measurements, but rather, the reliability of inferences from the data, an issue more appropriately redressed by statistical approaches than by validation with a separate method. If tested using statistically defined criteria for reliability/significance, microarray data do not appear a priori to require more independent validation than data obtained by any other method. In fact, because of added confidence from co-regulation, they may require less. In this article we also discuss our strategy of statistically correlating individual gene expression with biologically important endpoints designed to address the problem of evaluating functional relevance. We also review how work by ourselves and others with this powerful technology is leading to new insights into the complex processes of brain aging and AD, and to novel, more comprehensive models of aging-related brain change.</AbstractText>"}

Long considered a rather static post-translational modification of marginal interest, it seems that arginine methylation has now joined the group of signaling pathways that operate via pairs of antagonistic enzymes. However, many questions remain unanswered, especially concerning the removal mechanism and its implication for the physiological role of arginine methylation. I propose that, in addition to the broadly discussed function as regulator of protein activity, arginine methylation might serve a second purpose: protection of arginine residues against attack by endogenous reactive dicarbonyl agents, such as methylglyoxal, which are natural by-products of normal metabolic pathways. Inefficient detoxification of these highly cytotoxic compounds results in inactivation of proteins that is causally linked to diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and pathophysiologies of aging. This new concept of 'arginine protection' might have far-reaching implications for the development of drugs that exploit a natural protection mechanism for medical purposes.</AbstractText>"}

Neuropathologically, Alzheimer's disease is defined by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid protein deposited senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormal and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, regionalized neuronal death, and loss of synaptic connections within selective brain regions. Evidence has suggested a critical role for amyloid-beta peptide metabolism and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and progression. Among the other indices of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease brain are protein carbonyls and 3-nitrotyrosine, which are the markers of protein oxidation. Thus, in this review, we discuss the application of redox proteomics for the identification of oxidatively modified proteins in Alzheimer's disease brain and also discuss the functions associated with the identified oxidized proteins in relation to Alzheimer's disease pathology. The information obtained from proteomics may be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease as well as of other neurodegenerative disorders.

In neuronal networks, 'gain-of-function' of channels in excitatory neurotransmission could lead to hyper-excitation while 'loss-of-function' in inhibitory transmission impairs neuronal inhibitory system, both of which can result in epilepsy. A working hypothesis to view epilepsy as a disorder of channel or 'channelopathy' seems rational to explore the pathogenesis of epilepsy. However, the imbalance resulting from channel dysfunction is not sufficient to delineate the pathogenesis of all epilepsy syndromes of which the underlying channel abnormalities have been verified. Mutations identified in epilepsy, mainly in genes encoding subunits of GABA(A) receptors, undermine intracellular trafficking, thus leading to retention of channel molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process may cause ER stress followed by apoptosis, which is a known pathomechanism of certain neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the pathomechanism of 'channel trafficking abnormality' may provide a new paradigm to channelopathy to unsolved questions underlying epilepsy, such as differences between generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, which share the causative genetic abnormalities in the same genes and hence are so far considered to be within the spectrum of one disease entity or allelic variants.</AbstractText>"}

Together these observations raise the possibility that old age, and perhaps other factors (genetic and epigenetic) adversely affect viability and self-renewal capacity of microglia, resulting in the generation of senescent and/or dysfunctional cells.

The recent identification of autophagosomes in neurons in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders has, therefore, sparked controversy about whether these structures are contributing to neuronal cell death or protecting against it. Emerging evidence supports the view that induction of autophagy is a neuroprotective response and that inadequate or defective autophagy, rather than excessive autophagy, promotes neuronal cell death in most of these disorders.

ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination within the central and peripheral nervous system, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma, fibroblasts and tissues. The overall incidence of ALD is 1:17,000 including hemizygotes and heterozygotes who are frequently symptomatic. There are two main ALD phenotypes: 1) a cerebral demyelinating form which affects boys between 5-12 years, but also 35% of adult males; 2) a form that mainly involves the spinal cord (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN) in adult males between 20-50 years and 50% of heterozygous women after the age of 40 years. AMN presents with progressive spastic paraparesis. Addison's disease may be the first symptom of ALD in boys and adult males. These patients are at risk to develop cerebral ALD or AMN for life. ALD results from mutations in the ABCD1 gene without correlation between genotype and phenotype. The diagnosis of ALD relies upon the measurement of plasma VLCFA levels that allows the identification of 100% affected males and of 80-95% heterozygous women. Because of these false-negative, it is therefore mandatory to search for a mutation in the ABCD1 gene in all women at risk to be heterozygous for ALD. The ABCD1 gene encodes a peroxisomal transmembrane protein (ALD protein) with the structure of an half ATP-binding cassette transporter. It is possible that ALD protein imports VLCFA or VLCFA-CoA into peroxisomes in which they are degraded by a peroxisomal beta-oxidation system. Elongation of VLCFAs is enhanced in fibroblasts from ALD patients and likely contributes to the load of VLCFA in tissues. The underlying mechanisms that lead to cerebral demyelination, axonal degeneration in spinal cord and adrenal insufficiency are unknown. The 'toxic' role of VLCFA accumulation remains to be demonstrated. The mechanisms that lead to the inflammatory reaction in cerebral ALD might involve abnormal acylation of gangliosides and phospholipids by VLCFA that would result in immune reaction of brain macrophages and astrocytes bearing CD1 molecules that recognize lipid antigens. De novo mutation of ABCD1 occurs in less than 8% of ALD patients. The genetic counseling aims to identify: 1) women who are at risk to be heterozygous; 2) neurologically asymptomatic boys. It is only at this stage that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has clinical benefit; 3) ALD patients who have Addison's disease that can lead to sudden death. Prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villus samples, cultured amniotic fluid cells) relies upon DNA based mutation detection techniques, expression of ALD protein and measurement of VLCFA levels. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the only treatment that provides a permanent cure when the procedure is performed at an early stage of cerebral demyelination, i.e when the patients are asymptomatic despite abnormal brain MRI. Treatment of Addison's disease is mandatory but does not modify the course of neurological symptoms. Dietary therapy failed to halt the neurologic progression in cerebral ALD and AMN. It might have a partial preventive effect in boys treated before 6 years of age.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between high-resolution typing of HLA alleles and disease severity as measured by brain MRI quantitative markers of demyelinating and destructive pathology in patients with MS. In 41 MS patients (27 relapsing-remitting, 7 secondary progressive, and 7 primary progressive), we performed high-resolution typing of alleles HLA-DRB1*04, -DQB1*03, -DRB1*15, -DQB1*06, and of haplotypes -DRB1*04-DQB1*03 and -DRB1*15-DQB1*06.

Of 41 included patients, 13 were men and 28 were women. Mean age was 43.3 (SD 11.4) years, mean disease duration 10.3 (SD 7.8) years, and mean EDSS 2.3. DNA extraction and genomic typing were obtained with the sequence-specific primers method using primer pairs that amplified the HLA alleles. All patients underwent a 1.5-T MRI examination of the brain. Disease severity was assessed by clinical measures [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)] and MRI measures. T2- and T1-lesion volumes (LVs) and brain atrophy measures [fractions of brain parenchyma (BPF), gray matter (GMF), and white matter (WMF)] were calculated. We used general linear model analysis (GML), controlled for age, disease duration, and treatment status, to compare the MRI measures according to allele and haplotype status. The following significant results were found: HLA-DRB1*1501 positive patients had significantly lower GMF (0.493 vs 0.526, p &lt; 0.001), lower BPF (0.784 vs 0.815, p = 0.018), and higher T1-LV (2.8 vs 0.7ml, p = 0.036); -DQB1*0301 positive patients had significantly higher T2-LV (34.1 vs 0.7 ml, p = 0.041), and showed a trend for lower BPF (0.790 vs 0.846, p = 0.064); -DQB1*0302 positive patients had significantly lower T1-LV (2.4 vs 0.9 ml, p = 0.016); and -DQB1*0602 positive patients had significantly lower GMF (0.492 vs 0.521, p = 0.007) and lower BPF (0.781 vs 0.811, p = 0.023). No differences were found in the indices of MRI disease severity according to HLA haplotype associations. Both in correlation and in regression analyses, we observed significant associations between HLA-DRB1*1501 and lower GMF and BPF and higher T1-LV, between -DQB1*0301 and higher T2-LV and disease duration, between -DQB1*0302 and lower GMF and higher T1- and T2-LV, between -DQB1*0602 and lower GMF and BPF, and between -DQB1*0603 and higher T1-LV and EDSS.

Here we present solid-state NMR studies of PrP(89-143)(P101L) fibrils, probing the conformation of residues in the hydrophobic segment 112-124 with chemical shifts. The conformations of glycine residues were analyzed using doubly (13)C=O labeled peptides by two-dimensional (2D) double-quantum correlation, and double-quantum filtered dephasing distance measurements. MQ-NMR experiments were carried out to probe the relative alignment of the individual peptides fibrils. These NMR studies indicate that the 112-124 segment adopts an extended beta-sheet conformation, though not in a parallel, in register alignment.

Molecular actions of serine proteases include multiple cellular events like activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARs belong to a family of G protein-coupled receptors that can be stimulated through their proteolytic cleavage by ligands. PAR-2 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including astrogliosis. Although recent studies have shown that low concentration of trypsin activates PAR-2, its role in morphological changes in primary astrocytes has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PAR-2 in astrocyte stellation in rat primary astrocyte culture. Both trypsin (0.1-1 U/ml) and a PAR-2-activating peptide SLIGRL-NH2 (1-50 microM) significantly reversed the stellation induced by serum deprivation in rat astrocytes. Treatment of astrocytes with trypsin or SLIGRL-NH2 resulted in a transient rise of the intracellular Ca2+ level and trypsin-induced morphological changes were blocked by BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator. In addition, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide significantly inhibited the trypsin-induced morphological changes, whereas activation of PKC by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate acted as trypsin. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of PAR-2 by trypsin caused reversal of stellation in cultured astrocytes, in part, via the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKC.</AbstractText>"}

The activities of AChE in red blood cells (RBC-AChE) and BChE in serum can be used as potential biomarkers of suppressed and/or heightened activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Exposure to organophosphate (OP) chemical warfare agents (CWAs), pesticides, anesthetics, and a variety of drugs such as cocaine, as well as some neurodegenerative and liver disease states, selectively reduces AChE or BChE activity. In humans, the toxicity of pesticides is well documented. Therefore, blood cholinesterase activity can be exploited as a tool for confirming exposure to these agents and possible treatments. Current assays for measurement of RBC-AChE and serum BChE require several labor-intensive processing steps, suffer from wide statistical variation, and there is no inter-laboratory conversion between methods. These methods, which determine only the serum BChE or RBC-AChE but not both, include the Ellman, radiometric, and deltapH (modified Michel) methods. In contrast, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Whole Blood (WRAIR WB, US Patent #6,746,850) cholinesterase assay rapidly determines the activity of both AChE and BChE in unprocessed (uncentrifuged) whole blood, uses a minimally invasive blood sampling technique (e.g., blood from a finger prick), and is semi-automated for high-throughput using the Biomek 2000 robotic system. To date, the WRAIR whole blood assay was used to measure AChE and BChE activities in human blood from volunteers in FDA clinical trials. In the first FDA study, 24 human subjects were given either 30 mg PB orally (n = 19) or placebo (n = 5). Blood samples were obtained pre-dosing and 2.5, 5, 8, and 24 h post-dosing. The samples were analyzed for AChE and BChE activity using the WRAIR WB robotic system, and for PB concentration by HPLC. We found that maximal inhibition of AChE (26.2%) and concentration of PB (17.1 ng/mL) occurred at 2.5 h post-PB dosing. AChE activity returned to almost 100% of pre-dose values by 6 h. A dose-dependent linear correlation was found between the amount of PB measured in the blood and the inhibition of AChE. Following soman (GD) exposure, recovered AChE activity was similar to levels that were reversibly protected by the PB administration. Therefore, the WRAIR ChE WB data clearly supports the conclusion that PB is an effective pre-treatment drug for nerve agent exposure (GD). In the second FDA human study for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the WRAIR ChE WB assay was used to determine the RBC-AChE and serum BChE profile of healthy elderly volunteers receiving Huperzine A. Huperzine A is a plant-derived reversible and selective AChE inhibitor compared to BChE, and is a more potent inhibitor of AChE than PB. Huperzine A is available as a nutraceutical, a natural supplement reported to improve memory, and has a variety of neuroprotective effects. Individuals received an increasing dose regimen of huperzine A (final dose 200 microg after 4 weeks), which produced more than 50% inhibition of RBC-AChE. Huperzine A was well tolerated by these patients at doses that sequestered more RBC-AChE than PB, and thus warrants further study as a prophylaxis for OP poisoning in addition to Alzheimer's therapy. Due to the documented use of OPs by terrorists and in warfare around the globe, Federal, State, and local authorities need a reliable, fast, inexpensive, and standard method for confirming such an assault in order to initiate appropriate containment, decontamination, and treatment measures. This assay is ideal for prescreening military personnel for atypical ChE activities that would preclude their deployment to areas of potential CWA exposure. The WRAIR WB ChE assay will fulfill the requirement for rapid and reliable monitoring of such exposure in military and civilian populations.</AbstractText>"}

Developmental delay occurred from the age of 8 months, and the patient subsequently showed strabismus, loss of head control, failure to thrive and irregular respiration. She was admitted to our hospital at the age of 18 months. A definite diagnosis of Gaucher's disease type 2 was made from the presence of Gaucher cells and reduced glucocerebrosidase activity. Clinically, limited ocular movements, poor facial expression and bulbar palsy indicated disturbances in the nuclei of oculomotor, trochlear, abducent, facial and ambiguous nerves, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) failed to visualize any structural changes in the brain including the brainstem. Neurophysiologically, auditory brainstem response and somatosensory evoked potential demonstrated lesions in the cochlear nucleus and medial lemniscus, respectively. On polysomnography, disturbed sleep parameters during rapid eye movement sleep, in addition to the lack of modification of respiratory patterns by sleep stage, suggested dysfunctions in the locus ceruleus, raphe nuclei and pontine reticular formations. It is likely that these neurophysiological tests can be useful to identify functional lesions that are not detectable by MRI, and should help exploit new treatments for child-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Gaucher's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Last century, the priority in nutrition and food production was to achieve a high protein diet and somatic growth and function. The dietary content of omega-3 (N-3) required by the brain was neglected although evidence for the essentiality of certain fatty acids was published in 1929 and specifically re-affirmed for omega 3 in the brain in the 1970s. Cognitive decline with age and neurodegenerative disorder with dementia are now rising. This review describes signs of N-3 deficit in Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease, where maximum change involves the primary sites: olfactory cortex and the hippocampus. The olfactory agnosia observed in schizophrenia supports an N-3 deficit as does a reduction of key ologodendrocyte- and myelin-related genes in this disorder and affective disorder, where a rise in dementia accords with a deficit of N-3 also in this disorder. N-3 normalizes cerebral excitability at all levels. That the two disorders are localized at the extremes of excitability, is supported by their opposing treatments: convulsant neuroleptics and anti-epileptic anti-depressants. An adequate N-3 diet will probably prevent most psychotic episodes and prove that neurodegenerative disorder with dementia is also to a large extent not only preventable but avoidable.</AbstractText>"}

The etiology of ALS is still uncertain, but males are at increased risk for the disease than females. Several studies have suggested that motoneurons in ALS might be subjected to the double insult of increased DNA oxidative damage and deficiencies in DNA repair systems. Particularly, increased levels of 8-oxoguanine and impairments of the DNA base excision repair system have been observed in neurons of ALS patients. There is evidence that the Ser326Cys polymorphism of the human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) gene is associated with a reduced DNA repair activity. To evaluate the role of the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in sporadic ALS (sALS), we screened 136 patients and 129 matched controls. In the total population, we observed association between both the Cys326 allele (p=0.02) and the combined Ser326Cys+Cys326Cys genotype (OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.06-2.88) and increased risk of disease.

The copper-transporting P-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B are key molecules required for the regulation and maintenance of mammalian copper homeostasis. Their absence or malfunction leads to the genetically inherited disorders, Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively. These proteins have a dual role in cells, namely to provide copper to essential cuproenzymes and to mediate the excretion of excess intracellular copper. A unique feature of ATP7A and ATP7B that is integral to these functions is their ability to sense and respond to intracellular copper levels, the latter manifested through their copper-regulated trafficking from the transGolgi network to the appropriate cellular membrane domain (basolateral or apical, respectively) to eliminate excess copper from the cell. Research over the last decade has yielded significant insight into the enzymatic properties and cell biology of the copper-ATPases. With recent advances in elucidating their localization and trafficking in human and animal tissues in response to physiological stimuli, we are progressing rapidly towards an integrated understanding of their physiological significance at the level of the whole animal. This knowledge in turn is helping to clarify the biochemical and cellular basis not only for the phenotypes conferred by individual Menkes and Wilson disease patient mutations, but also for the clinical variability of phenotypes associated with each of these diseases. Importantly, this information is also providing a rational basis for the applicability and appropriateness of certain diagnostic markers and therapeutic regimes.

Aberrant production or decreased clearance of amyloid-beta peptides is widely accepted to be causative for AD. Amyloid-beta peptides are produced by sequential processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by the two aspartyl-type proteases beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Because proteases are generally classified as druggable, these secretases are a centre of attraction for various drug discovery efforts. Although a large number of specific drug-like gamma-secretase inhibitors have been discovered, progress towards the clinic has been slowed by the broad substrate specificity of this unusual intramembrane-cleaving enzyme. In particular, the Notch receptor depends on gamma-secretase for its signalling function and, thus, gamma-secretase inhibition produces distinct phenotypes related to a disturbance of this pathway in preclinical animal models. The main task now is to define the therapeutic window in man between desired central efficacy and Notch-related side effects. In contrast, most studies with knockout animals have indicated that beta-secretase inhibition may have minimal adverse effects; however, the properties of the active site of this enzyme make it difficult to find small-molecule inhibitors that bind with high affinity. In most instances, inhibitors are large and peptidic in nature and, therefore, unsuitable as drug candidates. Thus, there are many issues associated with the development of protease inhibitors for AD that must be addressed before they can be used to test the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' in the clinic. The outcomes of such trials will provide new directions to the scientific community and hopefully new treatment options for AD patients.</AbstractText>"}

Addressing this neurodegenerative component of the disease is an important treatment objective, since axonal injury is believed to underlie the accumulation of disability and disease progression. The precise relationship between the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components in multiple sclerosis remains poorly elucidated, although neurodegeneration appears to be at least partially independent from neuroinflammation. The mechanisms underlying axonal injury appear complex and are likely to be multifactorial. Specific treatment strategies need to be developed that act within the central nervous system to prevent neurodegeneration and need to be provided from the earliest stages of disease. It is likely that immunomodulatory treatments acting purely in the periphery will provide only indirect and not direct neuroprotection. A promising approach is to enhance neuroprotective autoimmunity inside the brain, believed to be mediated, at least in part, by the release of neurotrophic factors within the nervous system from infiltrating immune cells. Such a beneficial process would be inhibited by a non-selective immunosuppressive strategy. In summary, treatments of multiple sclerosis should take into account the heterogeneous pathophysiology of the disease. The pathogenic process in the central nervous system itself should be the major focus in multiple sclerosis therapy in order to protect against demyelination and axonal loss and to promote remyelination and regeneration directly in the target tissue, independently of peripheral immune status. In conclusion, selective treatment strategies aimed at preventing axonal injury within the central nervous system are required to complement existing, peripherally acting treatments targeting the immune system.</AbstractText>"}

The inflammatory lesions are characterized by massive infiltration by a heterogeneous population of cellular and soluble mediators of the immune system, including T cells, B cells, macrophages and mi croglia, as well as a broad range of cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, complement and other toxic substances. The appearance of such lesions is associated with clinical relapses. Recent detailed immunopathological studies of early, acute lesions revealed profound heterogeneity in the patterns of demyelination and the factors of the immune system involved. During remission, resolution of inflammation is the main factor which leads to clinical improvement of patients. However, the immune system can play a beneficial role at this stage, promoting remyelination perhaps by production of growth factors such as BDNF. In contrast, the progressive irreversible neurological deficit in multiple sclerosis is associated with neurodegenerative processes resulting in axonal and neuronal loss. The mechanisms behind damage to axons in multiple sclerosis lesions are poorly understood. However, the close proximity of areas with prominent axonal loss and areas containing inflammatory infiltrates (e. g., T cells, macrophages) suggest that axonal damage is closely associated with inflammation. Different soluble or cellular mediators of the immune response have been shown to damage axons in experimental systems, and these may be responsible for neurodegeneration in human disease.</AbstractText>"}

Cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes suggests a homeostasis block as a result of CLN6p deficiency. The cholesterol imbalance may affect structure/function of caveolae and lipid rafts, disrupting signalling transduction pathways and sorting cell mechanisms. Alterations in protein/lipid intracellular trafficking would affect the composition and function of endocytic compartments, including lysosomes. Dysfunctional endosomal/lysosomal vesicles may act as one of the triggers for apoptosis and cell death, and for a secondary protective inflammatory response. In conclusion, the data reported provide novel clues into molecular pathophysiological mechanisms of CLN6-deficiency, and may also help in developing disease biomarkers and therapies for this and other neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We report that pre-treatment of fibroblasts with the citrus flavanone, hesperetin, prior to peroxynitrite exposure protects against peroxynitrite-mediated cytotoxicity. This protection was partially mediated by the intracellular scavenging of peroxynitrite by hesperetin as exposure of fibroblasts to peroxynitrite following hesperetin loading led to the formation of two intracellular nitro-hesperetin derivatives. In addition, protection appeared to be mediated by hesperetin-induced changes in MAP kinase signalling. Exposure of fibroblasts to hesperetin led to concentration-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and was observed to restore peroxynitrite-mediated decreases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We propose that the protective potential of hesperetin in fibroblasts may be mediated both by intracellular scavenging of peroxynitrite and by modulation of fibroblast signalling.</AbstractText>"}

The p75 receptor participates with the TrkA receptor in the formation of high-affinity nerve growth factor-binding sites to promote survival under limiting concentrations of neurotrophins. Activation of Trk receptors leads to increased phosphorylation of Shc (Src homology and collagen homology), phospholipase C-gamma and novel adaptor molecules, such as the ARMS (ankyrin-rich membrane spanning)/Kidins220 protein. Small ligands that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors can also activate Trk receptor kinase activity. Transactivation of Trk receptors and their downstream signalling pathways raise the possibility of using small molecules to elicit neuroprotective effects for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Like amyloid precursor protein and Notch, p75 is a substrate for gamma-secretase cleavage. The p75 receptor undergoes an alpha-secretase-mediated release of the extracellular domain followed by a gamma-secretase-mediated intramembrane cleavage. Cleavage of p75 may represent a general mechanism for transmitting signals as an independent receptor and as a co-receptor for other signalling systems.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, this reversal was independent of NMDA antagonism, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, and cholinergic pathways. Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis, we conducted a comparative analysis of mitochondrial protein patterns. In all, 29 proteins exhibiting significant differences in their abundances were identified in the glutamate-treated group when compared with the control. The expression patterns in 22 out of these proteins could be reversed by post-treatment with bis(7)-tacrine. Most of the differentially expressed proteins are involved in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.

Recent reports have implicated a family of proteins known as histone deacetylases (HDACs) in various neuronal processes including the neuronal death program. Initial headway in this field has been made largely through the use of broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors. In fact, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC activity has been shown to protect neurons in several models of neurodegeneration. The observation that HDAC inhibitors can have opposing effects in different paradigms of neurodegeneration suggests that individual members of the HDAC protein family may play distinct roles that could depend on the specific cell type under study.

However, comparatively little is known about the effects of chronic smoking on human brain function. Although smoking rates have decreased in the developed world, they remain high in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Despite the high prevalence of comorbid chronic smoking in alcohol use disorders, very few studies have addressed the potential neurobiological or neurocognitive effects of chronic smoking in alcohol use disorders. Here, we briefly review the existing literature on the neurobiological and neurocognitive consequences of chronic cigarette smoking and summarize our neuroimaging and neurocognitive studies on the effects of comorbid chronic excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking in treatment-seeking and treatment-naïve populations. Our research suggests comorbid chronic cigarette smoking modulates magnetic resonance-detectable brain injury and neurocognition in alcohol use disorders and that neurobiological recovery in our abstinent alcoholics is adversely affected by chronic smoking. Consideration of the potential separate effects and interactions of chronic smoking and alcohol consumption may foster a better understanding of specific mechanisms and neurocognitive consequences of brain injury in alcoholism and of brain recovery during sustained abstinence from alcohol. The material presented also contributes to ongoing discussions about treatment strategies for comorbid alcoholism and cigarette smoking and will hopefully stimulate further research into the neurobiological and neurocognitive consequences of chronic smoking in alcoholism and other substance use disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Here we ask if archetypal IDPs in aqueous milieus are best described as swollen disordered coils in a good solvent or collapsed disordered globules in a poor solvent. To answer this question, we analyzed data from molecular simulations for a 20-residue polyglutamine peptide and concluded, in accord with experimental results, that water is a poor solvent for this system. The relevance of monomeric polyglutamine is twofold: It is an archetypal IDP sequence and its aggregation is associated with nine neurodegenerative diseases. The main advance in this work lies in our ability to make accurate assessments of solvent quality from analysis of simulations for a single, rather than multiple chain lengths. We achieved this through the proper design of simulations and analysis of order parameters that are used to describe conformational equilibria in polymer physics theories. Despite the preference for collapsed structures, we find that polyglutamine is disordered because a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations of equivalent compactness is populated at equilibrium. It is surprising that water is a poor solvent for polar polyglutamine and the question is: why? Our preliminary analysis suggests that intrabackbone interactions provide at least part of the driving force for the collapse of polyglutamine in water. We also show that dynamics for conversion between distinct conformations resemble structural relaxation in disordered, glassy systems, i.e., the energy landscape for monomeric polyglutamine is rugged. We end by discussing generalizations of our methods to quantitative studies of conformational equilibria of other low-complexity IDP sequences.</AbstractText>"}

Surprisingly, fibrillogenic nuclei composed of P301L mutant tau enhanced the assembly of P301L mutant tau into filaments but did not promote filament formation from wild-type tau.

There is now overwhelming evidence supporting the following statements: MS causes widespread tissue damage in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of the brain and spinal cord, whose extent and severity is more strictly associated to the clinical manifestations of the disease than the extent of focal pathology. Discrete, macroscopic lesions are just the tip of the iceberg of MS pathology. Grey matter (GM) damage is a consistent feature of all MS phenotypes, which is progressive from the start of the relapsing-remitting phase of the disease. As is the case for WM, GM damage is also a mixture of focal lesions and diffuse pathology. High-field strength MR scanners are improving our ability to image focal GM lesions and modern MR-based techniques are enabling us to quantify in vivo the extent and severity of GM pathology, which have been shown to correlate only moderately with the amount of WM changes. At least part of GM pathology in MS is not secondary to retrograde degeneration of fibers traversing WM lesions. The neurodegenerative component of the disease is not a late phenomenon and it is not completely driven by inflammatory demyelination. In fact, neurodegeneration occurs very early in the course of MS and the correlation between MRI measures of inflammation and neurodegeneration is weak in all disease phases. The interplay of inflammation and neurodegeneration is a complex and still poorly understood phenomenon. At least part of MS-related neurodegeneration is not directly driven by Wallerian degeneration. Functional cortical changes can be seen in virtually all MS patients and are likely to play a central role in the ability of the MS brain to respond to tissue injury and, hence, limit the functional consequences of structural damage. MS disability is not just the result of tissue destruction but rather a balance between tissue destruction, tissue repair and adaptive cortical reorganization. All of this calls for the concept of MS as a focal, inflammatory demyelinating, WM disease to be reexamined and to start viewing MS as a diffuse CNS disease with an important neurodegenerative component. This is central for identifying novel and effective treatment strategies.</AbstractText>"}

There is a high density of axonal transections in active demyelinating lesions, but also persistent low-level axonal damage in inactive plaques and diffuse axonal and neuronal loss throughout the nervous system. Initial axonal injury appears to be closely related to inflammation, but is not restricted to the lesions themselves. Damage may be propagated throughout the nervous system by anterograde Wallerian, retrograde or transynaptic degeneration.

Sporadic CJD (sCJD) can be transmitted between humans through medical procedures involving highly infected organs, such as the central nervous system. However, in variant CJD (vCJD), which is due to human contamination with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent, lymphoreticular tissue also harbors the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy-associated prion protein (PrP(TSE)), which poses a particularly acute risk for iatrogenic transmission. Two blood transfusion-related cases are already documented. In addition, the recent observation of PrP(TSE) in spleen and muscle in sCJD raised the possibility that peripheral PrP(TSE) is not limited to vCJD cases. We aimed to clarify the peripheral pathogenesis of human TSEs by using a nonhuman primate model which mimics human diseases. A highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was adapted to the detection of extraneural PrP(TSE). We show that affected organs can be divided into two groups. The first is peripheral organs accumulating large amounts of PrP(TSE), which represent a high risk of iatrogenic transmission. This category comprises only lymphoreticular organs in the vCJD/BSE model. The second is organs with small amounts of PrP(TSE) associated with nervous structures. These are the muscles, adrenal glands, and enteric nervous system in the sporadic, iatrogenic, and variant CJD models. In contrast to the first set of organs, this low level of tissue contamination is not strain restricted and seems to be linked to secondary centrifugal spread of the agent through nerves. It might represent a risk for iatrogenic transmission, formerly underestimated despite previous reports of low rates of transmission from peripheral organs of humans to nonhuman primates (5, 10). This study provides an additional experimental basis for the classification of human organs into different risk categories and a rational re-evaluation of current risk management measures.</AbstractText>"}

By this process, astrocytes may participate in intercellular communication and neuromodulation. Acute inflammation in vitro, induced by adding reactive microglia to astrocyte cultures, enhances TNFalpha production and amplifies glutamate release, switching the pathway into a neurodamaging cascade (Bezzi, P., Domercq, M., Brambilla, L., Galli, R., Schols, D., De Clercq, E., Vescovi, A., Bagetta, G., Kollias, G., Meldolesi, J., and Volterra, A. (2001) Nat. Neurosci. 4, 702-710). Because glial inflammation is a component of Alzheimer disease (AD) and TNFalpha is overexpressed in AD brains, we investigated possible alterations of the cytokine-dependent pathway in PDAPP mice, a transgenic model of AD. Glutamate release was measured in acute hippocampal and cerebellar slices from mice at early (4-month-old) and late (12-month-old) disease stages in comparison with age-matched controls. Surprisingly, TNFalpha-evoked glutamate release, normal in 4-month-old PDAPP mice, was dramatically reduced in the hippocampus of 12-month-old animals. This defect correlated with the presence of numerous beta-amyloid deposits and hypertrophic astrocytes. In contrast, release was normal in cerebellum, a region devoid of beta-amyloid deposition and astrocytosis. The Ca2+-dependent process by which TNFalpha evokes glutamate release in acute slices is distinct from synaptic release and displays properties identical to those observed in cultured astrocytes, notably PG dependence. However, prostaglandin E2 induced normal glutamate release responses in 12-month-old PDAPP mice, suggesting that the pathology-associated defect involves the TNFalpha-dependent control of secretion rather than the secretory process itself. Reduced expression of DENN/MADD, a mediator of TNFalpha-PG coupling, might account for the defect. Alteration of this neuromodulatory astrocytic pathway is described here for the first time in relation to Alzheimer disease.</AbstractText>"}

The end result of polyglutamine aggregation is a beta-sheet-rich deposit. There exists evidence that an important intermediate in the aggregation process involves intramolecular beta-hairpin structures. However, little is known about the starting state, monomeric polyglutamine. Most experimental studies of monomeric polyglutamine have concluded that the backbone is completely disordered. However, such studies are hampered by the inherent tendency for polyglutamine to aggregate. A recent computational study suggested that the glutamine residues in polyglutamine tracts have a significant propensity to adopt the left-handed polyproline II (P(II)) helical conformation. In this work, we use NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that glutamine residues possess a high propensity to adopt the P(II) conformation. We present circular dichroism spectra that indicate the presence of significant amounts of P(II) helical structure in short glutamine tracts. These data demonstrate that the propensity to adopt the P(II) structure is retained for glutamine repeats of up to at least 15 residues. Although other structures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, become possible at greater lengths, our data indicate that glutamine residues in monomeric polyglutamine have a significant propensity to adopt the P(II) structure, although not necessarily in long contiguous helical stretches. We note that we have no evidence to suggest that the observed P(II) helical structure is a precursor to polyglutamine aggregation.

We found that a further truncation of p25 to yield a Cdk5 inhibitory peptide (CIP) can specifically inhibit p25/Cdk5 activity in transfected HEK cells and primary cortical neurons. CIP was able to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal death induced caused by p25/Cdk5 and further studies with CIP may develop a specific Cdk5 inhibition strategy in the treatment of neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

The effect of nuclear inclusions formed by these disease proteins on the functional organization of the nucleus is only partially understood. In particular, it is not known whether polyglutamine disease proteins disrupt the function of Cajal bodies, which are subnuclear domains that play a role in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). snRNPs are an integral part of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery, so it is possible that mutant proteins that alter Cajal body activity indirectly affect pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we evaluate three different polyglutamine disease proteins--ataxin-1, ataxin-3, and huntingtin--for their ability to disrupt Cajal body localization and reduce the splicing of an artificial reporter in HeLa cells. Consistent with previous observations, ataxin-1 inclusions do not drastically alter the localization of Cajal bodies. In contrast, ataxin-3 inclusions associate with this structure. Inclusions formed by a fragment of the huntingtin protein do not associate with Cajal bodies or PML bodies, another subnuclear domain. Among the three disease proteins, only ataxin-3 significantly decreases the splicing of an artificial reporter. These results support the hypothesis that different mutant proteins vary in their ability to disrupt nuclear organization and function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Three RyR isoforms have been described thus far, and various areas of brain are known to express each of them. It is well established that neurons can express different RyR isoforms, but it is not known whether microglial cells do so. In the present study we showed that cultured human microglia from both fetal and adult brain specimens express mRNA for RyR1 and RyR2, whereas RyR3 mRNA can be detected only in fetal microglial cells. Calcium spectrofluorometry showed that high levels of the RyR agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC, 1-5 mM) induced elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in both types of cultured human microglial cells. This effect was attenuated by the RyR antagonist 1,1'-diheptyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dibromide (DHBP, 10 microM). Neurotoxicity of conditioned medium from human microglia and THP-1 monocytic cells stimulated with a combination of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or alpha-synuclein was diminished by DHBP. It was also diminished by 4-CmC at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than those used to stimulate intracellular Ca(2+) release. These data indicate that human microglial cells express functional RyRs and that selective RyR ligands exert antineurotoxic action on this cell type. Therefore, RyR ligands may represent a novel class of compounds that have utility in reducing microglial-mediated inflammation, which is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

To ensure that an adequate number of functionally relevant cells are present after transplantation, in vitro manipulation of cell fate before transplantation may be necessary to control the terminal phenotype of these cells. Using growth factors known to have a role in oligodendrocyte development such as sonic hedgehog, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), we have tried to increase the number of oligodendroglia derived from E18 cortical neurospheres. We have shown that although all of the growth factor combinations induce the formation of oligodendroglia, they do so in varying proportions, with PDGF favouring the formation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and sonic hedgehog favouring the formation of mature oligodendrocytes. To further enhance the generation of oligodendroglia we exposed neurospheres to B104-cell conditioned medium (B104 CM). Long-term growth of the neurospheres in this B104 CM increased markedly the number of cells committed to the oligodendrocyte lineage, specifically oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. These were then referred to as oligospheres. Our results suggest that the oligosphere culture system may provide a valuable source of cells for the reconstitution of oligodendrocytes in neurologic disorders.</AbstractText>"}

We found multiple regions of cortical thinning in OCD patients compared to the normal control group. Patients with OCD had thinner left inferior frontal, left middle frontal, left precentral, left superior temporal, left parahippocampal, left orbitofrontal, and left lingual cortices.

This study investigated the acute effect of DHEA alone and with l-Dopa in 12 females monkeys lesioned with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to model PD. DHEA administration alone improved the mean parkinsonian score at 1, 5 and 15mg/kg in moderately and severely impaired MPTP monkeys and increased blood DHEA concentrations. DHEA with a low dose of l-Dopa increased the l-Dopa effect in moderately and severely impaired MPTP monkeys. DHEA lengthened duration of the effect of the low dose of l-Dopa by 15-45min. DHEA at 1, 5 and 15mg/kg combined with a high dose of l-Dopa did not increase dyskinesias. DHEA could act by reducing inhibitory GABAergic activity in the striatal output pathways.

These two diseases share a common feature in that a normally soluble peptide (amyloid-beta) or protein (alpha-synuclein) aggregates into an ordered fibrillar structure. As well as structural similarities observed between fibrillar aggregates related to these diseases, common pathological processes of increased oxidative injury, excitotoxicity and altered cell cycle are also evident. It was the aim of this study to identify novel interacting proteins to the amyloid-like motif and therefore identify common potential pathways between neurodegenerative diseases that share biophysical properties common to classical amyloid fibrils. Optimal ageing of recombinant proteins to form amyloid-like fibrils was determined by electron microscopy, Congo red birefringement and photo-induced cross-linking. Using pull-down assays the strongest detected interacting protein to the amyloid-like motifs of amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and lysozyme was identified as histone H1. The interaction with the amyloid-like motif was confirmed by techniques including surface plasmon resonance and immunohistochemistry. Histone H1 is known to be an integral part of chromatin within the nucleus, with a primary role of binding DNA that enters and exits from the nucleosome, and facilitating the shift in equilibrium of chromatin towards a more condensed form. However, phosphorylated histone H1 is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and as yet the functional significance of this translocation is unknown. This study also found that histone H1 is localised within the cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes from areas affected by disease as well as amyloid plaques, supporting the hypothesis that histone H1 favoured binding to an ordered fibrillar motif. We conclude that the binding of histone H1 to a general amyloid-like motif indicates that histone H1 may play an important common role in diseases associated with amyloid-like fibrils.</AbstractText>"}

At cellular level, iron is unusually observed in microglia, immune effector cell of the brain. Most evidence has provided that upon activation, microglia produces neurotoxins and different kinds of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, it is believed that activated microglia is actively involved in neurodegenerative process. Using a rat microglial cell line (HAPI), the present study was designed to address the role of iron for immune function of microglia, in particular, the production of Nitric Oxide (NO) in the presence or absence of estrogen, a potential neuroprotective agent. The present results demonstrated that exposure of microglia to iron significantly decreased lipopolysaccaride-induced NO production, as determined by nitrite accumulation in the cell culture medium, and such effect of iron was potentiated by increasing concentration of estrogen. Transcript analysis revealed that estrogen, but not iron, decreased the expression of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS). These results demonstrate that estrogen enhances the inhibitory effect of iron on microglial NO production by decreasing mRNA expression of iNOS and also suggest that iron sequestration by microglia under neuropathological conditions could be a protective mechanism against NO-induced neurotoxicity.</AbstractText>"}

There is increasing evidence that there are cerebral based inflammatory processes that may contribute to the pathogenesis and to the progression of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including prion diseases. In peripheral tissues, a key element that controls the generation of proinflammatory mediators is the highly inducible protein cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In this study, in order to examine the possible association of COX-2 with the pathogenesis of scrapie, we analyzed the expression level and the cellular localization of COX-2 in the brains of control and scrapie-infected mice. The COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were increased significantly compared to the control group of mice. By immunohistological analysis, intense immunoreactivity of COX-2 was localized primarily in reactive astrocytes, with virtually no staining in sections from control mice. The staining for COX-2 was co-localized with the pathological form of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) and with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). These results suggest that the upregulation of COX-2 expression in astrocytes may be related to the accumulation of PrP(Sc), and that COX-2 may then lead to the progression of scrapie, possibly by propagation of a cerebral inflammatory response.</AbstractText>"}

We show that the activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is altered in HD. In particular, the transcription of key genes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is severely affected in vivo in brain tissue from HD mice and in human postmortem striatal and cortical tissue; this molecular dysfunction is biologically relevant because cholesterol biosynthesis is reduced in cultured human HD cells, and total cholesterol mass is significantly decreased in the CNS of HD mice and in brain-derived ST14A cells in which the expression of mutant huntingtin has been turned on. The transcription of the genes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is regulated via the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), and we found an approximately 50% reduction in the amount of the active nuclear form of SREBP in HD cells and mouse brain tissue. As a consequence, mutant huntingtin reduces the transactivation of an SRE-luciferase construct even under conditions of SREBP overexpression or in the presence of an exogenous N-terminal active form of SREBP. Finally, the addition of exogenous cholesterol to striatal neurons expressing mutant huntingtin prevents their death in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is impaired in HD cells, mice, and human subjects, and that the search for HD therapies should also consider cholesterol levels as both a potential target and disease biomarker.</AbstractText>"}

A previous study on the yeast homolog to CLN3, designated Btn1p, revealed a potential role for CLN3 in the transport of arginine into the yeast vacuole, the equivalent organelle to the mammalian lysosome. Lysosomes isolated from lymphoblast cell lines, established from individuals with juvenile Batten disease-bearing mutations in CLN3, but not age-matched controls, demonstrate defective transport of arginine. Furthermore, we show that there is a depletion of arginine in cells derived from individuals with juvenile Batten disease. We have, therefore, characterized lysosomal arginine transport in normal lysosomes and show that it is ATP-, v-ATPase- and cationic-dependent. This and previous studies have shown that both arginine and lysine are transported by the same transport system, designated system c. However, we report that lysosomes isolated from juvenile Batten disease lymphoblasts are only defective for arginine transport. These results suggest that the CLN3 defect in juvenile Batten disease may affect how intracellular levels of arginine are regulated or distributed throughout the cell. This assertion is supported by two other experimental approaches. First, an antibody to CLN3 can block lysosomal arginine transport and second, expression of CLN3 in JNCL cells using a lentiviral vector can restore lysosomal arginine transport. CLN3 may have a role in regulating intracellular levels of arginine possibly through control of the transport of this amino acid into lysosomes.</AbstractText>"}

A consistent feature of the major human neurodegenerative disorders is the accumulation of disease-related proteins, in non-native conformations, as protein aggregates within neurons or glial cells. Often the proteins in these aggregates are post-translationally conjugated with ubiquitin, suggesting a possible link between pathological protein-aggregation events in the nervous system and dysfunction of the UPS. Genetic evidence clearly demonstrates that disruption of ubiquitin-mediated processes can lead to neurodegeneration; however, the relationship between the UPS and idiopathic neurodegenerative disorders is less clear. In the latter cases, although a number of different mechanisms could potentially contribute to dysfunction of the UPS and promote the neurodegenerative process, whether UPS dysfunction is causally related to disease pathogenesis, or alternatively arises as a result of the pathological state, and indeed whether ubiquitinated inclusions are harmful or beneficial to cells, remains to be clarified.</AbstractText>"}

The UPS is involved in many essential cellular processes. Alterations in this proteolytic system are associated with a variety of human pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, immunological disorders and inflammation. The precise role of the UPS in the pathophysiology of these diseases, however, remains poorly understood. Detection of UPS aberrations has been a major challenge because of the complexity of the system. Most studies focus on various aspects of the UPS, such as substrate recognition, ubiquitination, deubiquitination or proteasome activity, and do not provide a complete picture of the UPS as an integral system. To monitor the efficacy of the UPS, a number of reporter substrates have been developed based on fluorescent proteins, such as the green fluorescent protein and its spectral variants. These fluorescent UPS reporters contain specific degradation signals that target them with high efficiency and accuracy for proteasomal degradation. Several studies have shown that these reporters can probe the functionality of the UPS in cellular and animal models and provide us with important information on the status of the UPS under various conditions. Moreover, these reporters can aid the identification and development of novel anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs based on UPS inhibition.</AbstractText>"}

Currently available drugs for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease or other dementias have limited efficacy. This may be due to their action at only one of the many neurotransmitter systems involved in the complex mechanisms that underlie cognition. An alternative approach would be to target second messenger systems that are utilized by multiple neurotransmitters. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger that plays a key role in biochemical processes that regulate the cognitive process of memory consolidation. Prolongation of cAMP signals can be accomplished by inhibiting phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Eleven PDE families, comprised of more than 50 distinct members, are currently known. This review summarizes the evidence demonstrating that rolipram, a selective inhibitor of cAMP-selective PDE4 enzymes, has positive effects on learning and memory in animal models. These data provide support for the general approach of second messenger modulation as a potential therapy for cognitive dysfunction, and specifically suggest that PDE4 inhibitors may have utility for improving the symptoms of cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Altered S100 protein levels are associated with a broad range of diseases, including cardiomyopathy, inflammatory and immune disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Although the precise role of S100 protein in carcinogenesis is poorly understood, it seems that formation of homo- and hetero-dimers, binding of Ca2+ and interaction with effector molecules are essential for the development and progression of many cancers. Several studies have suggested that S100 proteins promote cancer progression and metastasis through cell survival and apoptosis pathways. In animal models of bladder cancer, several S100 proteins are differentially expressed in bladder tumors relative to normal urothelium.

Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is a naturally-occurring, pluripotent, homeostatic agent. The olfactory lobe is normally enriched in carnosine and zinc. Loss of olfactory function and oxidative damage to olfactory tissue are early symptoms of AD. Amyloid peptide aggregates in AD brain are enriched in zinc ions. Carnosine can chelate zinc ions. Protein oxidation and glycation are integral components of the AD pathophysiology. Carnosine can suppress amyloid-beta peptide toxicity, inhibit production of oxygen free-radicals, scavenge hydroxyl radicals and reactive aldehydes, and suppresses protein glycation. Glycated protein accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients. Homocarnosine levels in human CSF dramatically decline with age. CSF composition and turnover is controlled by the choroid plexus which possesses a specific transporter for carnosine and homocarnosine. Carnosine reacts with protein carbonyls and suppress the reactivity of glycated proteins. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity is diminished in AD patient brains. Administration of CA activators improves learning in animals. Carnosine is a CA activator. Protein cross-links (gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-amino) are present in neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain. gamma-Glutamyl-carnosine has been isolated from biological tissue. Carnosine stimulates vimentin expression in cultured human fibroblasts. The protease oxidised-protein-hydrolase is co-expressed with vimentin. Carnosine stimulates proteolysis in cultured myocytes and senescent cultured fibroblasts. These observations suggest that carnosine and related structures should be explored for therapeutic potential towards AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOH) are the most oxygen-sensitive constituents of cells. The presence of alpha-TOH in biological membranes is required but not sufficient to protect them against lipid peroxidation. The data presented in this review consider the role of alpha-TOH and cytochrome b5 which permit operation of lipid-radical cycles and the participation of lipid-radical reactions in key processes occurring in the membrane. Analysis of role of these cycles in membrane bioenergetics led us to a model involving the adenine nucleotide translocator and ATP synthesis in brain mitochondria. This paper summarizes experimental evidence for oxidative and non-oxidative pathways of PUFA metabolism with respective intermediates, which could be relevant to elucidation of new mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Lipid-radical reactions in membranes work as important component of normal cell metabolism. Discussion is focused on the consequences of ineffective electron transfer to peroxyl radicals (LOO.--&gt; LOO-) and excessive oxidative pathway of PUFA metabolism (LOO.--&gt;LOOH) with two reactive secondary products: malondialdehyde and methylglyoxal.

Our previous work demonstrated a potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect of two thiadiazolidinones compounds, NP00111 (2,4-dibenzyl-[1,2,4]thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione) and NP01138 (2-ethyl-4-phenyl-[1,2,4]thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione), in primary cultures of cortical neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Here, we show that injection of NP031112, a more potent thiadiazolidinone derivative, into the rat hippocampus dramatically reduces kainic acid-induced inflammation, as measured by edema formation using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and glial activation and has a neuroprotective effect in the damaged areas of the hippocampus. Last, NP031112-induced neuroprotection, both in vitro and in vivo, was substantially attenuated by cotreatment with GW9662 (2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide), a known antagonist of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, suggesting that the effects of NP031112 can be mediated through activation of this receptor.

In iron-deficient cells, IRPs bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs) found in the mRNAs of ferritin, the transferrin receptor and other iron metabolism transcripts, thereby enhancing iron uptake and decreasing iron sequestration. IRP1 registers cytosolic iron status mainly through an iron-sulfur switch mechanism, alternating between an active cytosolic aconitase form with an iron-sulfur cluster ligated to its active site and an apoprotein form that binds IREs. Although IRP2 is homologous to IRP1, IRP2 activity is regulated primarily by iron-dependent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system in iron-replete cells. Targeted deletions of IRP1 and IRP2 in animals have demonstrated that IRP2 is the chief physiologic iron sensor. The physiological role of the IRP-IRE system is illustrated by (i) hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome, a human disease in which ferritin L-chain IRE mutations interfere with IRP binding and appropriate translational repression, and (ii) a syndrome of progressive neurodegenerative disease and anemia that develops in adult mice lacking IRP2. The early death of mouse embryos that lack both IRP1 and IRP2 suggests a central role for IRP-mediated regulation in cellular viability.</AbstractText>"}

We treated organotypic hippocampal cultures short-term (up to 4h) and long-term (5 days) with Abeta(1-40) (1nM-5microM). Abeta did not induce cell damage, apoptosis or synaptic loss. Short-term treatment down-regulated enzymatic activity of the kinase, by reducing its Thr(286) phosphorylation. In contrast, long-term treatment (1nM-microM) markedly and significantly up-regulated enzymatic activity, with peak stimulation at 10nM (three-fold). Up-regulation of activity was associated with increased expression of the alpha-isoform of CaM kinase II, increased phosphorylation at Thr(286) (activator residue) and decreased phosphorylation at Thr(305-306) (inhibitory residues). We investigated the effect of glutamate on CaM kinase II following exposure to 1 or 10nM Abeta(1-40). As previously reported, glutamate increased CaM kinase II activity. However, the glutamate effect was not altered by pretreatment of slices with Abeta. Short- and long-term Abeta treatment showed opposite effects on CaM kinase II, suggesting that long-term changes are an adaptation to the kinase early down-regulation. The marked effect of Abeta(1-40) on the kinase suggests that semi-physiological and slowly raising peptide concentrations may have a significant impact on synaptic plasticity in the absence of synaptic loss or neuronal cell death.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies have described partial knowledge for concrete items particularly following semantic dementia (SD). The present study was designed to investigate the occurrence of partial knowledge effects in the conceptual domain of abstract words. A novel 3-level synonym comprehension test was administered to 9 patients with SD, 20 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 40 healthy control subjects. All subject groups showed weaker performance on tasks requiring a fine specification of word meaning compared with those for which a broad sense of meaning or valence was necessary. However, this gradient of partial knowledge was significantly greater for SD and AD subjects than for controls. These results demonstrate that partial knowledge is a general property of a degraded knowledge base and is not restricted to the concrete word domain.

Several studies have demonstrated the alteration of NO-cGMP pathway in cognitive impairment. The present study was aimed to study the effect of sildenafil, a PDE5 inhibitor on diabetes and electroconvulsive shock (ECS)-induced cognitive dysfunction in rat using one-trial step-through type of passive avoidance and elevated plus-maze task. Diabetic and ECS-treated rats showed poor learning performance in step-through passive avoidance and plus-maze task. Acute administration of sildenafil significantly reversed the diabetes and ECS-induced retention deficits in both the test paradigms. Sildenafil also significantly improved the cognitive performance in young rats in both the paradigms. Furthermore, L-NAME, a non-selective NOS inhibitor and methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor blocked the effect of sildenafil. The results thus suggest that cognitive impairment might be due to the modulatory effect of nNOS or PDE5 enzyme on cGMP levels. Moreover, sildenafil-induced reversal of cognitive impairment suggests the protective role of PDE5 inhibitors in neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Investigations of senescent Sod1(-/-) mice of different ages showed that the older animals had drusen, thickened Bruch's membrane, and choroidal neovascularization. The number of drusen increased with age, and exposure of young Sod1(-/-) mice to excess light induced drusen. The retinal pigment epithelial cells of Sod1(-/-) mice showed oxidative damage, and their beta-catenin-mediated cellular integrity was disrupted, suggesting that oxidative stress may affect the junctional proteins necessary for the barrier integrity of the retinal pigment epithelium.

The precise nature of these changes is not fully understood; however, we believe that the most salient losses relate to self-relevant processing. Thus, FTLD patients exhibit emotional changes that are consistent with a reduction in self-monitoring, self-awareness and the ability to place the self in a social context. In contrast, other more primitive aspects of the emotional system may remain relatively intact. The startle response is a useful way to examine the precise nature of emotional deficits in neurological patients. In addition to a stereotyped defensive response (characterized by negative emotional facial behaviour and physiological activation), in many individuals it also evokes embarrassment, a self-conscious emotional response. Embarrassment seems to occur as the person becomes aware that the reaction to the startle was excessive and was observed by others. Because the self-conscious response depends on certain regions in frontal cortex, we expected that FTLD patients would have specific deficits in their self-conscious response. To test this notion, we examined the response of 30 FTLD patients and 23 cognitively normal controls to a loud, unexpected acoustic startle stimulus (115-dB burst of white noise). Emotional behaviours were measured along with an assessment of somatic, electrodermal, cardiovascular and respiratory responses. Results indicated that FTLD patients and controls were similar in terms of physiological responses and negative emotional facial behaviour to the startle, indicating that the defensive aspect of the startle was preserved. However, there were profound differences in the self-conscious response. FTLD patients showed significantly fewer facial signs of embarrassment than controls. This deficit in self-conscious response could not be explained by sex, cognitive status, age, education, medication, or differences in the negative emotional behaviour or physiological response. Thus, the emotional deficit in FTLD patients' response to the startle suggests a reduction in self-consciousness. These findings suggest that the emotional deficit in FTLD may be most profound in higher-order processes akin to those involved in the generation of embarrassment. These deficits are consistent with neural loss in the medial prefrontal cortex, which may play an important role in the production of self-conscious emotions. Disrupted self-conscious emotions in FTLD patients may have clinical importance because these deficits may underlie some of the socially inappropriate behaviours that are common in these patients.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, identifying signaling elements involved in those Abeta-induced cognitive impairments that occur prior to loss of neurons may reveal new potential pharmacological targets. Here, we report that the enzymatic activity of calcineurin, a key protein phosphatase involved in phosphorylation-dependent kinase activity crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory function, is upregulated in the CNS of the Tg2576 animal model for Abeta over-production. Furthermore, acute treatment of Tg2576 mice with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (10mg/kg i.p.) improves memory function.

Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, is characterized by prominent and irreversible nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss and intracellular protein aggregations. Epidemiological studies imply both environmental neurotoxins and genetic predisposition as potential risk factors for PD, though mechanisms underlying selective dopaminergic degeneration remain unclear. Studies with experimental PD models and postmortem PD brains have provided explicit evidence for mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress in PD pathogenesis. Recent identification of mutants in PINK1, DJ-1, Parkin, and LRRK-2 genes compliments the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction hypotheses in dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in PD. Mutants of alpha-synuclein, Uch-L1 and Parkin support the involvement of UPS dysfunction in PD. Furthermore, various Parkinsonian toxicants have been shown to impair mitochondrial function, redox balances, and to some extent protein degradation machinery. Because environmental exposure to various neurotoxic agents is considered a dominant risk for development of PD, the interrelationship between neurotoxicant exposures and UPS dysfunction must be clearly understood. Elucidation of this interrelationship will help clarify 2 areas: (i) whether UPS dysfunction in PD is a primary pathogenic factor leading to nigral neuronal death or if it simply occurs as a consequence of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and (ii) the interaction of genes and environment in the acceleration of nigral dopaminergic degeneration by targeting UPS. We review the recent evidence for UPS deficits in dopaminergic degeneration triggered by neurotoxins.</AbstractText>"}

However, there is also evidence that the immune system itself is more abnormal in the secondary progressive phase according to a number of immune measures including dendritic cell function in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, neuropathologic studies suggest that there is inflammation in the brain of MS patients in the progressive stages in which inflammation takes a different form that includes a diffuse inflammatory process in the brain and activation of microglial cells.

In particular, the construct we used lacks amino acid residues 106-120 from the so-called amyloidogenic core of PrP (residues 106-126). Amyloid formation was accompanied by acquisition of resistance to proteinase K digestion. Aggregation of mPrP-(121-231) was investigated using a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques at pH 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 and at 37 and 65 degrees C. Under partially denaturing conditions (65 degrees C), aggregates of different morphologies ranging from soluble oligomers to mature amyloid fibrils of mPrP-(121-231) were formed. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that roughly spherical aggregates were readily formed when the protein was incubated at pH 5.5 and 65 degrees C for 1 h, whereas prolonged incubation led to the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. Samples incubated at 65 degrees C at pH 4.0 or 7.0 presented an initial mixture of oligomers and protofibrils or fibrils. Electrophoretic analysis of samples incubated at 65 degrees C revealed formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant oligomers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) and higher molecular weight aggregates of mPrP-(121-231).

Various COX-inhibitors were administered 45 min prior to the PTZ administration. Onset, duration of clonic convulsions and percentage mortality/recovery were recorded. Pretreatment with COX-inhibitors aspirin (10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.), naproxen (7 and 14 mg/kg, p.o.), nimesulide (1-5 mg/kg, p.o.) or rofecoxib (1-4 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently showed protection against PTZ-induced convulsions. COX-2 inhibitors were more effective as compared to non-selective COX-inhibitors. Rofecoxib (1 mg/kg) or nimesulide (1 mg/kg) also enhanced the sub-protective effect of diazepam or muscimol showing GABAergic modulation of COX-2 inhibitors. COX-2 inhibitors also antagonized the effect of flumazenil (4 mg/kg)- against PTZ-induced convulsions further confirming the GABAergic mechanism.

CdCl2 concentrations as low as 0.1 microM and for times as brief as 2 h significantly reduced CNTF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, the principle substrates of Jak kinases in neurons. The phosphorylation of STAT1 by interferon-gamma was also inhibited by CdCl2. However, activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase was not inhibited by CdCl2. Jak/STAT signaling was inhibited by CdCl2 selectively in cultures of chick retina neurons and neuroblastoma cells, whereas signaling in the nonneuronal cells HepG2 and chick skeletal myotubes was not affected.

PUFAs easily suffer oxidation. Identical marker compounds of these lipid peroxidation (LPO) processes are generated in both neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, indicating a close relationship between the inducers of these events. Apparently, any alteration of the cell membrane structure influences the channels crossing the cell wall and causes an influx of Ca2+ ions. Ca2+ ions induce activation of phospholipases, which cleave phospholipids. Thus, the generated free PUFAs serve as substrates of lipoxygenases (LOXs) and cyclooxygenases. LOXs transform PUFAs into lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs). If an outside impact exceeds a certain limit, the catalyzing bivalent iron ions in LOXs are liberated. They cleave the enzymatically generated LOOH molecules and induce a switch to nonenzymatic LPO reactions that produce peroxyl radicals (LOO*). Although LOO* radicals are also intermediates in enzymatic LPO processes, they are prevented from leaving the enzyme complex before the reaction is completed by generation of LOOH molecules. LOO* radicals are much more reactive than LOOH molecules and attack nearly all types of biological molecules. The generated products seem to serve as ligands for proteins that in turn induce gene activation. Thus, PUFA-phospholipids are apparently the precursor molecules of signal molecules that respond in a dose-related manner to any event that influences the cell structure by inducing an appropriate gene response. In this paper an overview of the deleterious chemical reactions initiated by LOO* radicals is presented. Many of these reactions have not been taken into account in previous research. These include epoxidation of cholesterol-PUFA esters, plasmalogens, and sphingolipids, as well as the release of hydrogen peroxide by the reaction of LOO* radicals with alcohols (sugars) and amines. The oxidation of proteins generating plaque formation involves only the LOO* radical-sensitive functional groups in side chains of the protein backbone and is therefore a rather late event in the development of Alzheimer disease and atherosclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

Biotinylation experiments indicated that almost all prion protein recovered in this fraction was exposed at the cell surface. Prion protein was efficiently separated from this fraction by a monoclonal antibody immuno-separation procedure.

Unfortunately, targeted drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), for the therapeutic advancement of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, is complicated by restrictive mechanisms imposed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Opsonization by plasma proteins in the systemic circulation is an additional impediment to cerebral drug delivery. This review gives an account of the BBB and discusses the literature on biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) with appropriate surface modifications that can deliver drugs of interest beyond the BBB for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in neurological disorders, such as AD. The physicochemical properties of the NPs at different surfactant concentrations, stabilizers, and amyloid-affinity agents could influence the transport mechanism.</AbstractText>"}

Sesame lignan compounds such as sesaminol glucosides (SG) exhibit a range of pharmacological activities including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory action. In this study, we tried to elucidate possible effects of SG on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory reaction and its underlying mechanism in cultured astrocytes. SG (10-100 microg/ml) inhibited LPS-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as inhibited LPS-induced cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression dose-dependently. This inhibitory effect of SG on NO and ROS generation was enforced by addition of glutathione (GSH) in culture. In addition, SG prevented LPS-induced DNA binding and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor KappaB (NF)-kappaB. Consistent with the inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB activity, SG inhibits phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory KappaB (IkappaB), thereby translocation of p50 of NF-kappaB. These data show that SG has an anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of NF-kappaB, and may be a useful agent for prevention of inflammatory disease like AD.</AbstractText>"}

Midbrains from embryonic day 14 Fischer 344 rats were mechanically dissociated and grown on poly-D-lysine coated 24 well plates to a confluent layer of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. The culture was injured with either a mechanical scrape or foreign-body placement (segments of 50 microm diameter stainless steel microwire), fixed at time points from 6 h to 10 days, and assessed by immunocytochemistry. Microglia invaded the scraped wound area at early time points and hypertrophied activated astrocytes repopulated the wound after 7 days. The chronic presence of microwire resulted in a glial scar forming at 10 days, with microglia forming an inner layer of cells coating the microwire, while astrocytes surrounded the microglial core with a network of cellular processes containing upregulated GFAP. Vimentin expressing cells and processes were present in the scrape at early times and within the astrocyte processes forming the glial scar. Neurons within the culture did not repopulate the scrape wound and did not respond to the microwire, although they were determined to be electrically active through patch clamp recording. The time course and relative positions of the glia in response to the different injury paradigms correlated well with stereotypical in vivo responses and warrant further work in the development of a functional in vitro test bed.</AbstractText>"}

In AD, the key pathogenic event is linked to the formation of a 4-kDa amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, generated by sequential cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In CJD and other prion diseases, the process is initiated by conformational changes of the cellular prion protein, or PrP(C), into a beta-sheet rich isoform, named PrP(Sc), which acquires protease-resistance and detergent insolubility. Once generated, Abeta and PrP(Sc) are highly prone to misassembly under thermodynamically favourable oligomeric forms and protofibril/fibril structures. The variety of physicochemical states exhibited by Abeta and PrP(Sc) is accounted for by distinct molecular forms with different amino and/or carboxyl termini and alternative conformations. Unlike Abeta, PrP(Sc) is also infectious, and this feature poses public health concerns, as in the case of iatrogenic and variant CJD (vCJD). Several lines of evidence suggest that Abeta and PrP(Sc) are the main factors responsible for death of selected neuronal populations in brains of AD and prion disease's victims. Therefore, in addition to symptomatic treatment of dementia, therapeutic efforts are currently aimed at testing the efficacy of disease-modifying, anti-amyloid therapies. Experimental and clinical therapeutic interventions include passive and active immunization against amyloidogenic peptides, non immunological strategies, as well as drugs enhancing the nonamyloidogenic protein processing. In this review, we focus on molecular mechanisms of AD and prion diseases, and on novel treatment approaches.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, several findings concerning the relationships between the biochemical activities of the TGases and the basic molecular mechanisms responsible for some human diseases, have been reported. For example, some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), supranuclear palsy, etc., are characterized in part by aberrant cerebral TGase activity and by increased cross-linked proteins in affected brains. Our article describes the biochemistry and the physio-pathological roles of the TGase enzymes, with particular reference to human pathologies in which the molecular mechanism of disease can be due to biochemical activities of the tissue TGase enzyme (tTGase, type 2), such as in a very common human disease, Celiac Disease (CD), and also in certain neuropsychiatric disorders.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we extended these observations to investigate the long-term survival of such transplants in immunosuppressed rats. Unilateral 6 OHDA lesioned rats received grafts into the dopamine denervated striatum of either primary porcine fetal neural tissue dissected from the E26 cortex or cortically derived neural stem cells which had been derived from the same source but expanded in vitro for 21 days. All cortically derived neural stem cell grafts survived up to 5 months in contrast to the poor survival of primary porcine xenografts. Histological analysis demonstrated good graft integration with fibers extending into the surrounding host tissue including white matter with synapse formation, and in addition there was evidence of host vascularization and myelinated fibers within the graft area. This study has therefore shown for the first time the reliable long-term survival of grafts derived from porcine expanded neural precursors in a rat model of PD, with maturation and integration into the host brain. This demonstrates that such xenografted cells may be able to recreate the damaged circuitry in PD although strategies for dopaminergic differentiation of the porcine neural precursor cell remain to be refined.</AbstractText>"}

The syndrome is characterized by episodes of rapid deterioration during febrile illnesses or following head trauma and symmetrical demyelination of the brain white matter with cavitation aspects, leading to a progressive vanishing of the white matter replaced by CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). However, a wide clinical spectrum has been observed in the 148 patients presently reported, from congenital forms with rapid death to adult-onset forms with slow mental decline and progressive motor dysfunction, sometimes associated with congenital eye abnormalities or ovariodysgenesis. So far, 77 different mutations in each of the five EIF2B genes (EIF2B1-5), encoding subunits eIF2Balpha-epsilon, have been found, with two-thirds affecting the eIF2Bepsilon subunit.

We first became interested in EPAC when we discovered that the expression levels of both EPAC1 and EPAC2 were altered in those regions of the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease [McPhee, Breslin, Kewney, MacKenzie, Cooreman, Gibson and Hammond (2004) International Patent number WO 2004/096199 A2]. It was known that compounds could be designed to be selective for EPAC over PKA (protein kinase A); however, these compounds were all based around the core structure of cAMP. We decided to screen a small compound library (10000 compounds) to investigate the possibility of developing a compound series outside of the cAMP structure. We subsequently developed a novel, high-throughput screen based on the displacement of [3H]cAMP from the EPAC cAMP-binding site and identified small molecule hits from the Scottish Biomedical Lead Generation Library. These compounds selectively bind to the cAMP-binding sites of EPAC1 and EPAC2 and are structurally dissimilar to cAMP. They have similar affinities for both EPAC1 and EPAC2 and have a high degree of specificity for EPAC over PKA. We believe that these compounds provide a valuable starting point for a drug optimization programme.</AbstractText>"}

The pathogenic mechanism that links this conformational distortion with the development of prion diseases is unknown. PrP(C) is a GPI-anchored cell surface protein that associates with lipid rafts, undergoes endocytosis and recycles. Although the physiological function of PrP(C) remains unknown it has been related with a number of processes, including cellular copper transport and metabolism. PrP(C) has two copper binding domains and copper induces changes in PrP(C) conformation and endocytic behavior. However, the role of copper in prion diseases is unclear. PrP(C) expression and interaction with PrP(Sc) are required for prion progression. Therefore, factors that modify PrP(C) expression levels, conformation, intracellular trafficking and segregation into membranous microdomains could change the opportunities for and the quality of PrP(C) interactions with PrP(Sc) and thus influence prion pathogenesis. Here we discuss the potential of copper as modifier of these processes, attempting to integrate apparently contradictory observations which so far left uncertain whether copper exerts beneficial or detrimental effects upon prion diseases. The outcome of copper effects might be the resultant of two opposite conditions: one promoting misfolding of PrP(C) leading to prion conversion and the other promoting PrP(C) trafficking through pathways that prevent PrP(Sc)-PrP(C) interaction. Which of these predominates might vary under distinct conditions that need to be defined before deciding on the feasibility of either incorporating or avoiding metal influences in prion disease therapies.</AbstractText>"}

Expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract above a threshold size leads to misfolding and aggregation and eventual intracellular accumulation of the disease-specific protein. To date, only symptomatic treatments of limited effectiveness are available. Various research strategies aim to interfere with known steps in the pathomechanism. Protein misfolding and aggregation probably occur very early in the cascade of pathogenic events and are therefore attractive targets for potential drug treatment. Misfolding of polyQ proteins may either be prevented by drugs that stabilize the native conformation or via induction of cellular chaperones. Several amyloid-binding dyes as well as small molecules that inhibit polyQ protein aggregation have been identified in compound screens and may be entered into drug development. Small molecule inhibitors of further pathogenic phenomena like transcriptional repression, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal cell death have been tested in vitro and in vivo. The first drugs have now reached clinical trial stage. More general studies of how putative steps in the pathomechanism can be modulated will yield further insights into the pathogenesis of polyQ disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Reduced 5-HT turnover is consistently associated with impaired long-term memory functioning. Low 5-HT function may also impair cognitive flexibility and improve focused attention. On the other hand, stimulation of central 5-HT has repeatedly been found to impair performance in a true vigilance task. Currently, there is little evidence for mirrored cognitive changes due to opposite 5-HT manipulations in healthy volunteers. Given the mounting evidence for a role of 5-HT in human cognition, reduced 5-HT function could be directly linked to cognitive disturbances in certain conditions, such as in depression and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). There is evidence that stimulating (i.e. normalizing) 5-HT activity in depression may have specific beneficial effects on cognition, independent of a general relief of depressive symptoms, but this premise needs to be confirmed by larger-scale clinical studies. Recently, a potential role of 5-HT in the cognitive symptoms in AD has been identified, but there is insufficient data to evaluate the effects of 5-HT stimulation on cognitive symptoms in AD. It is concluded that serotonin is a potential target for pharmacological cognition enhancement, particularly for restoration of impaired cognitive performance due to 5-HT dysfunction. Further differentiation of the role of 5-HT in normal and disturbed cognition and evaluation of the effects of 5-HT manipulations in various populations is required to establish the full potential of 5-HT drugs as cognition enhancers.</AbstractText>"}

Conversely, NGF, a neurotrophin that plays a crucial role in promoting neurotrophic and neurotropic effects in sympathetic neurons, has recently been identified as a novel angiogenic molecule exerting a variety of effects on endothelial cells and in the cardiovascular system in general. VEGF and NGF have also been implicated in both neurodegenerative and vascular diseases. The pleiotropic effects of these growth factors have raised interest in assessing their therapeutic potential. The challenge for the future is to unravel to what extent the effects of these growth factors are interrelated with regards to their angiogenic, and neurotrophic effects and how to design selective drugs interfering with their respective actions. Most biological actions of NGF and VEGF are mediated by their cognate receptor protein tyrosine kinases, tropomyosin related kinase (trkA for NGF) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR, VEGFR-2, flk-1 for VEGF), which activate a complex and integrated network of signaling pathways in neurons and endothelial cells. Two small molecules, K252a and SU-5416, which are antagonists of trkA and VEGFR-2, respectively, may serve as key tools in dissecting the role of NGF and VEGF in angiogenesis and neurogenesis.

These defects represent important steps in the neurodegenerative cascade, although in many cases, a clear consensus has yet to be reached regarding their causal relationship to the disease. A growing body of evidence lends support to a link between neurite transport defects in the very early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases and alterations in the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton initiated by filament dynamizing proteins in the ADF/cofilin family. This article focuses on cofilin, which in neurons under stress, including stress induced by the amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-42 peptide, undergoes dephosphorylation (activation) and forms rod-shaped actin bundles (rods). Rods inhibit transport, are sites of amyloid precursor protein accumulation, and contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Because rods form rapidly in response to anoxia, they could also contribute to synaptic deficits associated with ischemic brain injury (e.g., stroke). Surprisingly, cofilin undergoes phosphorylation (inactivation) in hippocampal neurons treated with Abeta1-40 at high concentrations, and these neurons undergo dystrophic morphological changes, including accumulation of pretangle phosphorylated-tau. Therefore, extremes in phosphoregulation of cofilin by different forms of Abeta may explain much of the Alzheimer's disease pathology and provide mechanisms for synaptic loss and plaque expansion.</AbstractText>"}

Development of disease appears to be linked to processes that increase the rate at which alpha-synuclein forms aggregates. These processes include increased protein concentration (via either increased rate of synthesis or decreased rate of degradation), and altered forms of alpha-synuclein (such as truncations, missense mutations, or chemical modifications by oxidative reactions). Aggregated forms of the protein are toxic to cells and one therapeutic strategy would be to reduce the rate at which aggregation occurs. To this end we have designed several peptides that reduce alpha-synuclein aggregation. A cell-permeable version of one such peptide was able to inhibit the DNA damage induced by Fe(II) in neuronal cells transfected with alpha-synuclein (A53T), a familial PD-associated mutation.</AbstractText>"}

Whereas most other investigators have employed synthetic Abeta peptides, we have taken advantage of a beta-amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing cell line (referred to as 7PA2) that secretes sub-nanomolar levels of low-n oligomers of Abeta. These are composed of heterogeneous Abeta peptides that migrate on SDS/PAGE as dimers, trimers and tetramers. When injected into the lateral ventricle of rats in vivo, these soluble oligomers inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation and alter the memory of a complex learned behaviour. Biochemical manipulation of 7PA2 medium including immunodepletion with Abeta-specific antibodies and fractionation by size-exclusion chromatography allowed us to unambiguously attribute these effects to low-n oligomers. Using this paradigm we have tested compounds directed at three prominent amyloid-based therapeutic targets: inhibition of the secretases responsible for Abeta production, inhibition of Abeta aggregation and immunization against Abeta. In each case, compounds capable of reducing oligomer production or antibodies that avidly bind Abeta oligomers also ameliorate the synaptotoxic effects of these natural, cell-derived oligomers.</AbstractText>"}

ROS (reactive oxygen species) are the primary mediators of oxidative stress and many of the aggregating proteins and peptides associated with neurodegenerative disease can generate hydrogen peroxide, a key ROS, apparently through interactions with redox-active metal ions. Our recent results suggest that ROS are generated during the very early stages of protein aggregation, when protofibrils or soluble oligomers are present, but in the absence of mature amyloid fibrils. The generation of ROS during early-stage protein aggregation may be a common, fundamental molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of oxidative damage, neurodegeneration and cell death in several different neurodegenerative diseases.

Both insulin and cholesterol can also act as signalling molecules in the central nervous system that participate in neuronal function, memory and neurodegenerative diseases. A high-cholesterol diet improves spatial memory in experimental animals. beta-Amyloid, the toxic peptide in neurons of AD (Alzheimer's disease) patients, binds cholesterol and catalyses its oxidation to 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, a highly toxic oxysterol that is a potent inhibitor of alpha-PKC (alpha-protein kinase C), an enzyme critical in memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity and implicated in AD. Oxidized cholesterol also can act as a second messenger for insulin. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein inhibits insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the signalling kinases ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and PKB/Akt. In sporadic AD patients, insulin levels are decreased, suggesting links between AD and diabetes. Insulin signalling is also important in synaptic plasticity. Insulin receptors are up-regulated and undergo translocation after spatial learning. Insulin modulates the activity of excitatory and inhibitory receptors including the glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and activates two biochemical pathways: the shc-ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/PKC pathway, both of which are involved in memory processing. These findings point to a convergence at the biochemical level between pathways involved in AD and those important for normal memory.</AbstractText>"}

Heat shock proteins can act like antigens in many infectious diseases. Immunological response against proteins from HSP 60, HSP 70 and HSP 90 families was observed in diseases caused by bacterial and protozoan pathogens. It is known that ischemia and reperfusion activate HSP genes transcription in heart cells of various experimental animals. Human and Chlamydia pneumoniae HSP 60 were found in patients with stable coronary disease. Hence many researchers connect the increase of ischaemia with the passed infection caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, which can influence the origin or development of atheromatous plaque in the vascular wall. HSPs play an important role in hyperthermic therapy commonly used together with irradiation. Moreover, works on the possibility of HSP application to delay of disease process in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson or Alzheimer diseases are conducted.

NO is also a neuroprotective agent; multiple mechanisms having been demonstrated that can contribute to cell survival as levels of antioxidants and trophic factors are reduced with aging. Small molecules that mimic the biological activity of NO, including NO donors, may thus ameliorate cognition and provide neuroprotection. Several lines of evidence have linked the neurodegeneration and dementia characteristic of Alzheimer's disease with the action of beta-amyloid protein at the alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The interplay of Abeta with alpha7-nicotinic ACh receptors operating via the ERK signaling cascade links the amyloid cascade and the cholinergic hypothesis in pathways that impact synaptic plasticity and memory. This interplay also provides linkages to disruption of NO/cGMP signaling in AD, and in addition, recent direct evidence has been found demonstrating that Abeta downregulates the NO/cGMP/CREB pathway. Activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase elevating cGMP in the brain represents the central element of a therapeutic approach to the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, furthermore, evidence suggests that NO may display cGMP-independent activity and may operate via multiple biochemical signaling pathways to ensure the survival of neurons subjected to stress. GT 1061 is an NO chimera, an NO mimetic compound that contains an ancillary, synergistic pharmacophore, currently in clinical trials for Alzheimer's.

Much evidence now indicates that Abeta multimers can trigger neurodegenerative changes that involve formation of dystrophic neurites and cytoskeletal collapse, possibly due loss of microtubule (MT) stabilization by the tau protein. We have found that several MT-stabilizing agents such as Taxol significantly enhanced neuronal survival in the presence of Abeta and identified agents that enter the brain, a necessity for in vivo testing in animal models of tau pathology. Studies were designed to test two agents in the tau mutant (JNPL3) mouse that develops severe motor deficits at about seven months of age, accompanied by neuropathological markers of tau pathology. In addition to using motor performance tests through the planned period of drug administration, we designed a simple appetitive memory test that required a reduction in ad lib food intake. Although the neurochemical data are still being analyzed, we were surprised to find that all of the JNPL3 mice, whether receiving the drug or not, developed no signs of motor impairment up to 10 months of age. This is considerably beyond the age at which free-fed mice survived and suggests that the food restriction alone may have delayed the pathological process. A study is ongoing with free-fed mice to determine if the drug interventions do have any beneficial effects in these mutant mice.</AbstractText>"}

Focused, in-parallel synthetic chemistry platforms, combined with computational analyses serving as decision aids in planning, minimize the total number of compounds synthesized while maximizing the probability of creating bioavailable compounds that sample diverse chemical space. Incorporating a hierarchal strategy that emphasizes early selection of synthesized compounds based on biological or biophysical endpoints presents fewer and more relevant compounds for secondary evaluation of in vivo efficacy using animal screens with disease relevant or clinically translatable endpoints. We summarize here an interdisciplinary approach at the chemistry-biology interface that is used for the rapid discovery of novel lead compounds for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The chemistry platform uses established chemistries amenable to in-parallel strategies to create synthetic diversifications of the privileged pyridazine chemotype that sample a restricted chemical space.

Therapies that lead to cessation of the degenerative process still leave the brain riddled with deteriorated neural circuits and reduced neuron number. The discovery of neurogenesis in the adult brain and the regenerative potential of neural stem cells holds the promise for restoration of neural populations and regeneration of neural circuits necessary for cerebral function. While the regenerative potential of neural stem cells is great, so too is the challenge of delivering neural stem cells to the brain. Basic science analyses and human trials indicate that constituents of microenvironments within the brain determine the neurogenic potential, phenotypic differentiation of neural stem cells and magnitude of the neural stem cell pool. Multiple analyses have documented that dentate neurogenesis is regulated by multiple growth factors which are abundant during development and which dramatically decline with age. While the cause(s) of age-associated decline in neurogenesis remains to be fully determined, loss in growth factors, FGF-2, IGF-1 and VEGF, in the microenvironment of the subgranular zone (SGZ) are prime contributors to the reduced neurogenic potential. The decline in dentate neurogenesis can be observed as early as middle age. In the aged and AD brain, both the pool of neural stem cells and their proliferative potential are markedly diminished. In parallel, the level of potential regenerative factors is diminished in the brains of Alzheimer's patients compared to age-matched controls. Our efforts have been directed towards discovery and development of small, blood brain barrier penetrant molecules to promote endogenous proliferation of neural stem cells within the brain. These endeavors have led to the discovery that the neurosteroid alloprognanolone (APalpha) is a potent and highly efficacious proliferative agent in vitro and in vivo of both rodent and human neural stem cells. Results of our in vitro studies coupled with our more recent analyses in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD suggest that APalpha is a promising strategy for promoting neurogenesis in the aged brain and potentially for restoration of neuronal populations in brains recovering from neurodegenerative disease or injury. A brief overview of issues impacting the therapeutic potential of neurogenesis and the factors used to promote neurogenesis in the aging and degenerating brain is presented. Also included is a review of our current research into the neurogenic potential of the small molecule, blood brain barrier penetrating, neurosteroid allopregnanolone (APalpha).</AbstractText>"}

How these diverse functions are coordinated among the hundreds of mitochondria in a given cell is largely unknown, but is probably dependent on the dynamic nature of mitochondria. In this review, we explore the latest developments in mitochondrial dynamics in mammals. These studies indicate that mitofusins and OPA1 are essential for mitochondrial fusion, whereas Fis1 and Drp1 are essential for mitochondrial fission. The overall morphology of the mitochondrial population depends on the relative activities of these two sets of proteins. In addition to the regulation of mitochondrial shape, these molecules also play important roles in cell and tissue physiology. Perturbation of mitochondrial fusion results in defects in mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration, poor cell growth and increased susceptibility to cell death. These cellular observations may explain why mitochondrial fusion is essential for embryonic development. Two inherited neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A and autosomal dominant optic atrophy, are caused by mutations in mitofusin 2 and OPA1, suggesting that proper regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is particularly vital to neurons. Mitochondrial fission accompanies several types of apoptotic cell death and appears important for progression of the apoptotic pathway. These studies provide insight into how mitochondria communicate with one another to coordinate mitochondrial function and morphology.</AbstractText>"}

Neuroretinal dystrophies occupy a prominent place among neurodegenerative diseases, because of the large number and prevalence of disease-causing genes, the diverse functions, the wealth of allelic, non-allelic and clinical heterogeneities determining the phenotypic expressivity and penetrance of the disease and the ease of use of animal models to probe gene function and disease pathogenesis in a well-defined neuroretinal circuitry. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has a prevalence of about one in 4000. RP is a retinal dystrophy leading primarily to the progressive death of photon-capturing neurons--the rod photoreceptors.

Considerable attention has addressed the role that disruption to frontostriatal circuitry can play in mediating nonmotor dysfunction in PD. The three nonmotor frontostriatal circuits, which connect frontal cortical regions to the basal ganglia, originate from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The objective of the current study was to use our understanding of frontostriatal circuit function (via literature review) to categorize neuropsychological measures of cognitive and behavioral executive functions by circuit. To our knowledge, such an approach has not been previously attempted in the study of executive dysfunction in PD. Neuropsychological measures of executive functions and self-report behavioral inventories, categorized by circuit function, were administered to 32 nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (NDPD) and to 29 demographically matched, healthy normal control participants (NC). Our findings revealed significant group differences for each circuit, with the PD group performing worse than the NC group. Among the patients with PD, indices of impairment were greater for tasks associated with DLPFC function than with OFC function. Further, only an index of DLPFC test performance was demonstrated to significantly discriminate individuals with and without PD. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nondemented patients with PD exhibit greater impairment on neuropsychological measures associated with DLPFC than with ACC or OFC circuit function.</AbstractText>"}

The pathological similarities of the different NCLs have led not only to the grouping of these disorders but also to suggestion that the NCL proteins function in the same biological pathway. Despite extensive research, including the development of several model organisms for NCLs and establishment of high-throughput techniques, the precise biological function of many of the NCL proteins has remained elusive. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the functions, or proposed functions, of the different NCL proteins.</AbstractText>"}

The specific association between APOE genotype and recovery from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is conflicting with many groups finding the APOE 4 allele to be associated with poorer outcome while others have found no association. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between APOE 4 allele presence and recovery during the two years after injury from severe TBI in light of other potential covariates, such as age, race, gender, hypotension or hypoxia before hospital admission and severity of injury. APOE genotype was determined for 123 subjects with severe TBI. Glasgow outcome score (GOS) and mortality were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after injury. Results showed individuals improved over the two year period following injury and those with the 4 allele had a slower recovery rate than those without the APOE 4 allele over the two year period. We did not however find significant differences in GOS at individual time points when controlling for other covariates. Our findings suggest that APOE 4 allele presence influences recovery rate from severe TBI independent of other covariates. The findings of this study are unique in that they address not only the relationship between APOE 4 allele presence and outcome from severe TBI, but also describe differences in trajectory of recovery by APOE 4 allele presence.</AbstractText>"}

Accumulation of these dysregulated processes requires a mechanism that maintains their functional stability and allows the evolution of the neurodegenerative phenotype. In malignant cells, the capacity to buffer transformation has been attributed to heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Although normal proteins seem to require limited assistance from the chaperone, their aberrant counterparts seem to be highly dependent on Hsp90. Whereas enhanced Hsp90 affinity for mutated or functionally deregulated client proteins has been observed for several oncoproteins, it is unknown whether Hsp90 plays a similar role for neuronal proteins and thus maintains and facilitates the transformed phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases. Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant phosphorylation and/or expression of Tau protein, leading to a time-dependent accumulation of Tau aggregates and subsequent neuronal death. Here, we show that the stability of p35, a neuronal protein that activates cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 through complex formation leading to aberrant Tau phosphorylation, and that of mutant but not WT Tau protein is maintained in tauopathies by Hsp90. Inhibition of Hsp90 in cellular and mouse models of tauopathies leads to a reduction of the pathogenic activity of these proteins and results in elimination of aggregated Tau. The results identify important roles played by Hsp90 in maintaining and facilitating the degenerative phenotype in these diseases and provide a common principle governing cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The latter phenomenon is known as 'excitotoxicity' and has been associated with a wide range of acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, as well as disorders that result in the loss of non-neural cells such as oligodendroglia in multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately clinical trials with glutamate receptor antagonists that would logically seem to prevent the effects of excessive receptor activation have been associated with untoward side effects or little clinical benefit. In the mammalian CNS, the extracellular concentrations of glutamate are controlled by two types of transporters; these include a family of Na(+)-dependent transporters and a cystine-glutamate exchange process, referred to as system X(c)(-). In this review, we will focus primarily on the Na(+)-dependent transporters. A brief introduction to glutamate as a neurotransmitter will be followed by an overview of the properties of these transporters, including a summary of the presumed physiologic mechanisms that regulate these transporters. Many studies have provided compelling evidence that impairing the function of these transporters can increase the sensitivity of tissue to deleterious effects of aberrant activation of glutamate receptors. Over the last decade, it has become clear that many neurodegenerative disorders are associated with a change in localization and/or expression of some of the subtypes of these transporters. This would suggest that therapies directed toward enhancing transporter expression might be beneficial. However, there is also evidence that glutamate transporters might increase the susceptibility of tissue to the consequences of insults that result in a collapse of the electrochemical gradients required for normal function such as stroke. In spite of the potential adverse effects of upregulation of glutamate transporters, there is recent evidence that upregulation of one of the glutamate transporters, GLT-1 (also called EAAT2), with beta-lactam antibiotics attenuates the damage observed in models of both acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. While it seems somewhat unlikely that antibiotics specifically target GLT-1 expression, these studies identify a potential strategy to limit excitotoxicity. If successful, this type of approach could have widespread utility given the large number of neurodegenerative diseases associated with decreases in transporter expression and excitotoxicity. However, given the massive effort directed at developing glutamate receptor agents during the 1990s and the relatively modest advances to date, one wonders if we will maintain the patience needed to carefully understand the glutamatergic system so that it will be successfully targeted in the future.</AbstractText>"}

Both neurons and glia contain mtDNA with somatic mutations. Single neurons harbor a geometric mean (95% CI) of 200.3 (152.9-262.4) somatic mtDNA point mutations per million base pairs, compared to 133.8 (97.5-184.9) for single glia (p=0.0251).

Binding of GTP to LRRK1 is specific, requires the GTPase-like Roc domain, and leads to a stimulation of LRRK1 kinase activity. LRRK1 is the first example of a GTP-regulated protein kinase harboring both the kinase effector domain and the GTP-binding regulatory domain. Hence, we propose a model in which LRRK1 cycles between a GTP-bound active and a GDP-bound inactive state. Moreover, we mutated LRRK1 to mimic mutations previously identified in LRRK2/dardarin, the only human paralogue of LRRK1, that have been linked to autosomal-dominant parkinsonism. We demonstrate that three of four mutations analyzed significantly downregulate LRRK1 kinase activity.

To identify novel genes with a cell-death-related function in neurons, we screened 4,964 Drosophila GS lines, in which one or two genes from much of the Drosophila genome can be overexpressed. Approximately 0.68% of the GS lines produced phenotypes involving a loss of postmitotic neurons. Of these, we identified and characterized the endd2 gene, which encodes the Drosophila ortholog of Sec61alpha (DSec61alpha), an endoplasmic reticulum protein with protein translocation activity. Ectopic expression of DSec61alpha caused neural cell death accompanied by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which was mediated by DSec61alpha's translocon activity. This supported our previous observation that the DSec61alpha translocon contributes to expanded polyglutamine-mediated neuronal toxicity, which is also associated with ubiquitinated protein accumulation. These data suggest that the translocon may be a novel component of neural cell death and degeneration pathways. Our approach can be used to identify potential neurotoxic factors within the whole genome, which will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of various types of cell death, including those associated with human neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The manifestation of the sleep disturbances is twofold: nighttime hyperarousal sometimes accompanied by irritability and agitation, and daytime excessive sleepiness. Thus, although treatment with sedatives or hypnotics may offer some relief to the nighttime hyperarousal, the daytime excessive sleepiness remains mostly unresolved. Recently, however, more promising results in relief of excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as nighttime hyperarousal, are offered by the chronobiological approach. This approach attributes the sleep problems of AD patients to a dysfunction in a broader neuronal mechanism, namely the biological clock, that paces various physiological functions, among which is the sleep-wake cycle. The biological clock, situated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, receives environmental light input via neuronal signals from the retina. The SCN, in turn, innervates the pineal gland, that is responsible for the production and release of melatonin. Light stimulus causes the attenuation of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland; whereas the cessation of light increases melatonin secretion. In diurnal mammals, the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is in accordance with sleep onset. The chronobiological approach offers two main treatments to the sleep problems in AD patients: morning exposure to bright light and evening administration of melatonin, both of which show at least moderate success in restoring the sleep-wake cycle in AD patients, that is more marked in the early stages of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Neuroprotection by BclX(L), Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or BclX(L) plus GDNF co-expression were studied at 2 weeks and at 6-8 weeks after lesions. In both lesion paradigms, the efficacy of this combination approach significantly differed depending on post-lesion time. We show that BclX(L) expression is more important for neuronal survival in the early phase after lesions, whereas GDNF-mediated neuroprotection becomes more prominent in the advanced state of neurodegeneration.

VPA treatment of rat cerebellar granule cells caused a robust dose- and time-dependent increase in levels of alpha-syn protein and mRNA and in the intensity of alpha-syn immunostaining. Knockdown of VPA-induced alpha-syn overexpression with alpha-syn antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA completely blocked VPA-induced neuroprotection. alpha-Syn knockdown also exacerbated glutamate neurotoxicity, stimulated the expression of the proapoptotic gene ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2N, and downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. Induction of alpha-syn by VPA was associated with inhibition of HDAC activity, resulting in hyperacetylation of histone H3 in the alpha-syn promoter and a marked increase in alpha-syn promoter activity. Moreover, VPA-induced alpha-syn induction and neuroprotection were mimicked by HDAC inhibitors sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and trichostatin A (TSA). alpha-syn was also induced by VPA in rat cerebral cortical neurons. Additionally, treatment of rats with VPA, sodium butyrate, or TSA markedly increased alpha-syn protein levels in the cortex and cerebellum.

However, the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative states is not yet well understood. Thus, to evaluate the molecular mechanisms leading to those diseases, suitable research tools such as synthetic polyglutamine peptides are required. The synthesis and purification of such peptides are usually difficult because of poor solubility, which leads to low coupling and/or deblocking reactivity. After exploring many synthesis, solubilization and purification approaches, a protocol allowing the production of polyglutamines in good yield and high purity was developed. With this protocol, peptides of 10-30 glutamine residues were synthesized using a linear solid-phase strategy combined with a maximal side-chain protection scheme using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. After cleavage of the peptide from the polymeric support, the crude material was treated with glacial acetic acid and lyophilized. This treatment significantly improved the solubility of the polyglutamine peptides thus allowing their dissolution in aqueous conditions and purification through reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. These solubilization and purification conditions led to the formation of N-pyroglutamyl peptide derivatives that were easily isolated.

The presence in the porcine genome of TNRs within genes that, in humans, can undergo pathogenic expansions support the usage of the pig as an alternative animal model for studies of TNR evolution, stability, and functional properties.</AbstractText>"}

Chemical genetics, positioned at the interface of chemistry and genetics, can be used for elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying diseases and for drug discovery. This review discusses recent advances in chemical genetics and how small-molecule tools can be used to study and ultimately treat orphan genetic diseases.

Dyrk1 phosphorylates the human microtubule-associated protein tau at Thr212 in vitro, a residue that is phosphorylated in fetal tau and hyper-phosphorylated in Alzheimer disease (AD) and tauopathies, including Pick disease (PiD). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr212 primes tau for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). The present study examines Dyrk1A in the cerebral cortex of sporadic AD, adult DS with associated AD, and PiD. Increased Dyrk1A immunoreactivity has been found in the cytoplasm and nuclei of scattered neurons of the neocortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus in AD, DS, and PiD. Dyrk1A is found in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions which are enriched in phosphorylated tau in AD brains, thus suggesting a possible association of Dyrk1A with neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Yet, no clear relationship has been observed between tau phosphorylation at Thr212, and GSK-3 and Dyrk1A expression in diseased brains. Transgenic mice bearing a triple tau mutation (G272V, P301L, and R406W) and expressing hyper-phosphoyrylated tau in neurons of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebral neocortex show increased expression of Dyrk1A in individual neurons in the same regions. However, transgenic mice over-expressing Dyrk1A do not show increased phosphorylation of tau at Thr212, thus suggesting that Dyrk1A over-expression does not trigger per se hyper-phosphorylation of tau at Thr212 in vivo. The present observations indicate modifications in the expression of constitutive Dyrk1A in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases associated with tau phosphorylation.</AbstractText>"}

However, recent evidence indicates that minocycline does not always present beneficial actions. For instance, in an in vivo model of Huntington's disease, it fails to afford protection after malonate intrastriatal injection. Moreover, it reverses the neuroprotective effect of creatine in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. This apparent contradiction prompted us to analyze the effect of this antibiotic on malonate-induced cell death. We show that, in rat cerebellar granular cells, the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor malonate induces cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. By using DFCA, monochlorobimane and 10-N-nonyl-Acridin Orange to measure, respectively, H2O2-derived oxidant species and reduced forms of GSH and cardiolipin, we observed that malonate induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to an extent that surpasses the antioxidant defense capacity of the cells, resulting in GSH depletion and cardiolipin oxidation. The pre-treatment for 4 h with minocycline (10-100 microM) did not present cytoprotective actions. Moreover, minocycline failed to block ROS production and to abrogate malonate-induced oxidation of GSH and cardiolipin. Additional experiments revealed that minocycline was also unsuccessful to prevent the mitochondrial swelling induced by malonate. Furthermore, malonate did not induce the expression of the iNOS, caspase-3, -8, and -9 genes which have been shown to be up-regulated in several models where minocycline resulted cytoprotective. In addition, malonate-induced down-regulation of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 was not prevented by minocycline, controversially the mechanism previously proposed to explain minocycline protective action. These results suggest that the minocycline protection observed in several neurodegenerative disease models is selective, since it is absent from cultured cerebellar granular cells challenged with malonate.</AbstractText>"}

These diseases give rise to atypical forms of dementia and, unlike Alzheimer's disease (AD), are often associated with neurological symptoms. Clinical symptoms reflect the localization of the degenerative process rather than the nature of the underlying histopathology. Degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobe presents initially with behavioral alterations, but later in the course, impairment of cognition and activities of daily living develops. Posterior cortical atrophy affects the parietal and occipital association cortices and causes complex visual disturbances. In corticobasal degeneration (CBD) the focus of pathology includes the frontoparietal cortex and several subcortical nuclei, causing symmetrical rigidity, bradykinesia, myoclonus and dystonia. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) involves the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex as well as parts of the brain stem. Clinical features include a hypokinetic rigid syndrome with nuchal dystonia and vertical gaze palsy. Huntington's disease is a prototypical autosomal dominant disorder that affects the extrapyramidal system and causes choreatic movements in combination with personality changes and cognitive deterioration. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with dementia is a neurodegeneration of the frontotemporal cortex and of the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Behavioral change similar to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is paralleled or followed by the classic features of motor neuron disease.</AbstractText>"}

However, equally important, but often neglected, are ovarian hormone effects on glia. Our in vivo and in vitro studies show that estradiol modifies both neuronal growth and glial activity and these effects are tightly linked. Estradiol stimulates neurite growth and the release of the glial apolipoprotein E (apoE) in culture studies. Estradiol-stimulated neurite growth in these cultures requires apoE. Estradiol replacement in ovariectomized mice transiently increases the expression of apoE, the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) and synaptophysin throughout the brain. Continuous estradiol replacement over two months loses effect on apoE, LRP, and synaptophysin and suppresses reactive gliosis. Estrous cycle variation of glial activation (GFAP) and apoE are not identical. We propose that estradiol (and other ovarian hormones) functions as a zeitgeber to co-ordinate neuronal-glial interactions. Co-ordination assures temporally appropriate excitatory and inhibitory interactions between glia and neurons. With aging and the loss of ovarian cyclicity, some of this co-ordination must be diminished. These observations present significant clinical implications. Approaches to hormone therapy (HT), for diminishing the risk of chronic neurological diseases, need to consider the temporal nature of ovarian hormones in brain repair and plasticity. Moreover, approaches must consider apoE genotype. The neuroprotective effects of HT in numerous chronic age-related diseases may represent effective co-ordination of repair processes rather than direct disease-specific actions. Moreover, the role of glial-derived proteins in neuroprotection should not be ignored.</AbstractText>"}

In the current study we tested if LC loss influenced beta amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposition. LC neuronal degeneration was induced in transgenic mice expressing mutant V717F human amyloid precursor protein (APP) by treatment with the selective neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine DSP4 (5mg/kg every 2 weeks beginning at age 3 months). At 9 months of age, when control mice show low amyloid load, DSP4-treated mice showed an approximately 5-fold increase in the average number of Abeta plaques. This was accompanied by an increase in the levels of APP C-terminal cleavage fragments. DSP4-treatment increased both microglial and astroglial activation. In vivo, DSP4-treatment decreased expression and activity of the Abeta degrading enzyme neprilysin, while in vitro NA increased phagocytosis of Abeta1-42 by microglia.

Differential protein expression and/or modification are always context dependent i.e. they happen within a specific context of a tissue, organ, environmental situation and individual fate. Consequently, the function/dysfunction (in a certain disease) of a specific gene cannot be predicted comprehensively by its sequence only. Genetic information can only be understood when genes and proteins are analyzed in the context of the biological system and specific networks they are involved in. In regard to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) many proteins are known for long years to be the cause or the consequence of the pathomechanism of the respective disease. The treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases represents a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry, whereas the understanding of their pathogenesis is still in its infancy. With the development of several powerful techniques for proteome analysis it is now possible to investigate the expression of thousands of proteins in single cells, tissues or whole organisms at the same time. These developments opened new doors in medical sciences, and identification of cellular alterations associated with e.g. neurodegeneration will result in the identification of novel diagnostic as well as therapeutic targets.

The normal cellular function of ataxin-2 and the mechanism by which polyglutamine expansion of ataxin-2 causes neurodegeneration are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ataxin-2 and its Drosophila homolog, ATX2, assemble with polyribosomes and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), a key regulator of mRNA translation. The assembly of ATX2 with polyribosomes is mediated independently by two distinct evolutionarily conserved regions of ATX2: an N-terminal Lsm/Lsm-associated domain (LsmAD), found in proteins that function in nuclear RNA processing and mRNA decay, and a PAM2 motif, found in proteins that interact physically with PABP. We further show that the PAM2 motif mediates a physical interaction of ATX2 with PABP in addition to promoting ATX2 assembly with polyribosomes. Our results suggest a model in which ATX2 binds mRNA directly through its Lsm/LsmAD domain and indirectly via binding PABP that is itself directly bound to mRNA. These findings, coupled with work on other ataxin-2 family members, suggest that ATX2 plays a direct role in translational regulation. Our results raise the possibility that polyglutamine expansions within ataxin-2 cause neurodegeneration by interfering with the translational regulation of particular mRNAs.</AbstractText>"}

We have demonstrated that 3-AP is also a potent neuroprotectant (as such, it is referred to as 'PAN-811'). In vitro it completely blocks ischemic neurotoxicity at a concentration of 0.5 microM (EC(50) approximate, equals 0.35 microM) and hypoxic toxicity at 1.2 microM (EC(50) approximate, equals 0.75 microM). Full protection of primary cortical and striatal neurons can be achieved with 3-AP when it is added to the medium at up to six hours after an ischemic insult. 3-AP also suppresses cell death induced by neurotoxic agents, including staurosporine, veratridine and glutamate, indicating activity against a central target(s) in the neurodegenerative process. 3-AP acts via neutralization of two important intracellular effectors of excitatory neurotoxicity; calcium and free radicals. Its reported ability to elevate anti-apoptotic proteins is likely to be a consequence of the suppression of excessive intracellular free calcium. In a rat model of transient ischemia, a single bolus delivery of 3-AP 1 h after the initiation of ischemic attack reduced infarct volume by 59% when administered i.c.v.

Conversion of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP), normal cellular PrP (PrP(c)), into a misfolded form, abnormal PrP (PrP(Sc)), plays a key role in TSE transmission and pathogenesis. The intensified surveillance of scrapie in the European Union, together with the improvement of PrP(Sc) detection techniques, has led to the discovery of a growing number of so-called atypical scrapie cases. These include clinical Nor98 cases first identified in Norwegian sheep on the basis of unusual pathological and PrP(Sc) molecular features and 'cases' that produced discordant responses in the rapid tests currently applied to the large-scale random screening of slaughtered or fallen animals. Worryingly, a substantial proportion of such cases involved sheep with PrP genotypes known until now to confer natural resistance to conventional scrapie. Here we report that both Nor98 and discordant cases, including three sheep homozygous for the resistant PrP(ARR) allele (A(136)R(154)R(171)), efficiently transmitted the disease to transgenic mice expressing ovine PrP, and that they shared unique biological and biochemical features upon propagation in mice. These observations support the view that a truly infectious TSE agent, unrecognized until recently, infects sheep and goat flocks and may have important implications in terms of scrapie control and public health.</AbstractText>"}

FXTAS is thought to be caused by a toxic 'gain-of-function' of the expanded CGG-repeat FMR1 mRNA, which is found in the neuronal and astrocytic intranuclear inclusions associated with the disorder. Using a reporter construct with a FMR1 5' untranslated region harboring an expanded (premutation) CGG repeat, we have demonstrated that intranuclear inclusions can be formed in both primary neural progenitor cells and established neural cell lines. As with the inclusions found in post-mortem tissue, the inclusions induced by the expanded CGG repeat are alphaB-crystallin-positive; however, inclusions in culture are not associated with ubiquitin, indicating that incorporation of ubiquitinated proteins is a later event in the disease process. The absence of ubiquitinated proteins also argues against a model in which inclusion formation is due to a failure of the proteasomal degradative machinery. The presence of the expanded CGG repeat, as RNA, results in reduced cell viability as well as the disruption of the normal architecture of lamin A/C within the nucleus. This last observation, and the findings that lamin A/C is present in both the inclusions of FXTAS patients and the inclusions in cell culture, suggests that lamin A/C dysregulation may be a component of the pathogenesis of FXTAS; in particular, the Charcot-Marie-Tooth-type neuropathy associated with FXTAS may represent a functional laminopathy.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we generated A53T mutant alpha-synuclein-inducible PC12 cell lines using the Tet-off regulatory system. Inducing expression of A53T alpha-synuclein in differentiated PC12 cells decreased proteasome activity, increased the intracellular ROS level and caused up to approximately 40% cell death, which was accompanied by mitochondrial cytochrome C release and elevation of caspase-9 and -3 activities. Cell death was partially blocked by cyclosporine A [an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) process], z-VAD (a pan-caspase inhibitor) and inhibitors of caspase-9 and -3 but not by a caspase-8 inhibitor. Furthermore, induction of A53T alpha-synuclein increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and elevated caspase-12 activity. RNA interference to knock down caspase-12 levels or salubrinal (an ER stress inhibitor) partially protected against cell death and further reduced A53T toxicity after treatment with z-VAD. Our results indicate that both ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to A53T alpha-synuclein-induced cell death.

How the primary amino acid sequence triggers misfolding and determines the benign or toxic character of the misfolded protein remains largely obscure. Among proteins that misfold, polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion proteins provide an interesting case: Each causes a distinct neurodegenerative disease that selectively affects different neurons. However, all are broadly expressed and most become toxic when the glutamine expansion exceeds approximately 39 glutamine residues. The disease-causing polyQ expansion proteins differ profoundly in the amino acids flanking the polyQ region. We therefore hypothesized that these flanking sequences influence the specific toxic character of each polyQ expansion protein. Using a yeast model, we find that sequences flanking the polyQ region of human huntingtin exon I can convert a benign protein to a toxic species and vice versa. Further, we observe that flanking sequences can direct polyQ misfolding to at least two morphologically distinct types of polyQ aggregates. Very tight aggregates always are benign, whereas amorphous aggregates can be toxic. We thereby establish a previously undescribed systematic characterization of the influence of flanking amino acid sequences on polyQ toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

A particularly compelling example of how profoundly these intramolecular and intermolecular factors can modulate the toxicity of a misfolded protein is provided by the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. All of these disorders are caused by glutamine expansions in proteins that are broadly expressed, yet the nature of the proteins that harbor the glutamine expansions and the particular pathologies they produce are very different. We find, using a yeast model, that amino acid sequences that modulate polyQ toxicity in cis can also do so in trans. Furthermore, the prion conformation of the yeast protein Rnq1 and the level of expression of a suite of other glutamine-rich proteins profoundly affect polyQ toxicity. They can convert polyQ expansion proteins from toxic to benign and vice versa. Our work presents a paradigm for how a complex, dynamic interplay between intramolecular features of polyQ proteins and intermolecular factors in the cellular environment might determine the unique pathobiologies of polyQ expansion proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we found that the GLX2 gene, which encodes glyoxalase II enzyme, is up-regulated by p63 and p73. Accordingly, a specific responsive element was found in intron 1 of the GLX2 gene, which can be activated and bound by p63 and p73. We also found that, upon overexpression, the cytosolic, but not the mitochondrial, GLX2 inhibits the apoptotic response of a cell to methylglyoxal, a by-product of glycolysis. Likewise, we showed that cells deficient in GLX2 are hypersensitive to methylglyoxal-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a deficiency in GLX2 also enhances the susceptibility of a cell to DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These observations reveal a novel link between the p53 family and the glyoxalase system. Given that methylglyoxal is frequently generated under both physiological and pathological conditions, we postulate that GLX2 serves as a pro-survival factor of the p53 family and plays a critical role in the normal development and in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Briefly, synaptic overactivity leads to the excessive release of glutamate that activates postsynaptic cell membrane receptors, which upon activation open their associated ion channel pore to produce ion influx. To date, although molecular basis of glutamate toxicity remain uncertain, there is general agreement that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors plays a key role in mediating at least some aspects of glutamate neurotoxicity. On this view, research has focused in the discovery of new compounds able to either reduce glutamate release or activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Although NMDA receptor antagonists prevent excitotoxicity in cellular and animal models, these drugs have limited usefulness clinically. Side effects such as psychosis, nausea, vomiting, memory impairment, and neuronal cell death accompany complete NMDA receptor blockade, dramatizing the crucial role of the NMDA receptor in normal neuronal processes. Recently, however, well-tolerated compounds such as memantine has been shown to be able to block excitotoxic cell death in a clinically tolerated manner. Understanding the biochemical properties of the multitude of NMDA receptor subtypes offers the possibility of developing more effective and clinically useful drugs. The increasing knowledge of the structure and function of this postsynaptic NMDA complex may improve the identification of specific molecular targets whose pharmacological or genetic manipulation might lead to innovative therapies for brain disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of untranslated light neurofilament (NF-L) RNA causes motor neuron degeneration in transgenic mice, leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates in degenerating cultured motor neurons and triggers aggregation of NF-L protein and co-aggregation of mutant SOD1 protein in neuronal cells. Here, we report that p190RhoGEF, an RNA-binding protein that binds to a destabilizing element in NF-L mRNA, is involved in aggregation of NF-L protein and is implicated in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration. We show that p190RhoGEF co-aggregates with unassembled NF-L protein and that co-aggregation is associated with down-regulation of parent NF-L mRNA in neuronal cells. Co-expression of NF-M increases NF assembly and reduces RNA-triggered aggregation as well as loss of solubility of NF-L protein. siRNA-induced down-regulation of p190RhoGEF not only reduces aggregation and promotes assembly of NF-L and NF-M, but also causes reversal of aggregation and recovery of NF assembly in transfected cells. Examination of transgenic models of motor neuron disease shows that prominent aggregates of p190RhoGEF and NF-L and down-regulation of NF-L expression occur in degenerating motor neurons of mice expressing untranslated NF-L RNA or a G93A mutant SOD1 transgene. Moreover, aggregates of p190RhoGEF and NF-L appear as early pathological changes in presymptomatic G93A mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. Together, the findings indicate that p190RhoGEF is involved in aggregation of NF-L protein and support a working hypothesis that aggregation of p190RhoGEF and NF-L is an upstream event triggering neurotoxicity in motor neuron disease.</AbstractText>"}

Localization of mRNAs to subcellular regions has been detected in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes providing these domains with a locally renewable source of proteins. Protein synthesis in dendrites has most frequently been associated with synaptic plasticity, while axonally synthesized proteins appear to facilitate pathfinding and injury responses. For oligodendrocytes, mRNAs encoding several proteins for myelin formation are locally generated suggesting that this mechanism assists in myelination. Astrocytic processes have not been well studied but localization of GFAP mRNA has been demonstrated. Both RNA transport and localized translation are regulated processes. RNA transport appears to be highly selective and, at least in part, the destiny of individual mRNAs is determined in the nucleus. RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions determine which mRNAs are targeted to subcellular regions. Several RNA binding proteins that drive mRNA localization have also been shown to repress translation during transport. Activity of the translational machinery is also regulated in distal neural cell processes. Clinically, disruption of mRNA localization and/or localized mRNA translation may contribute to pathophysiology of fragile X mental retardation and spinal muscular atrophy. Axonal injury has been shown to activate localized protein synthesis, providing both a means to initiate regeneration and retrogradely signal injury to the cell body.

As a result of this, victims of CNS injury, stroke, or certain neurodegenerative diseases are unable to fully recover sensory, motor, cognitive, or autonomic functions. Regenerative failure is related to a host of inhibitory signals associated with the extracellular environment and with the generally low intrinsic potential of mature CNS neurons to regenerate. Most research to date has focused on extrinsic factors, particularly the identification of inhibitory proteins associated with myelin, the perineuronal net, glial cells, and the scar that forms at an injury site. However, attempts to overcome these inhibitors have resulted in relatively limited amounts of CNS regeneration. Using the optic nerve as a model system, we show that with appropriate stimulation, mature neurons can revert to an active growth state and that when this occurs, the effects of overcoming inhibitory signals are enhanced dramatically. Similar conclusions are emerging from studies in other systems, pointing to a need to consider combinatorial treatments in the clinical setting.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Neurologists therefore must be aware of the underlying causes, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and potential interventions when encountering a patient with underlying neurological disorders who is also complaining of poor sleep and insomnia. This article describes the underlying pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and potential interventions for insomnia in the neurological patient. Clinicians need to recognize that insomnia in older patients with underlying neurological disorders is not only unique, but also complex, demanding comprehensive and careful evaluation and management. Treatment of insomnia should start by addressing nonpharmacologic options, including improvements in sleep hygiene, improving sunlight exposure during the day, and searching for underlying reversible causes, such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movements, and circadian rhythm disturbances, all of which can precipitate insomnia when left untreated. Some patients may benefit from targeted and carefully tailored pharmacologic treatment. Successful amelioration of insomnia can ultimately be a very rewarding experience for the patient, family members, and the practitioner.</AbstractText>"}

In the present study, we have characterized calpain activation in cytosolic extract of mice cerebral cortex and cerebellum using an experimental model of fatal murine cerebral malaria (FMCM). Pathology of FMCM resulted in the increase in activity of calpains in both cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in the levels of mu-calpain (calpain-1) in the cytosolic fraction of infected cerebral cortex and cerebellum although a decrease in the level of m-calpain was observed in the cytosolic fraction of infected cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Calpain activation was further confirmed by monitoring the formation of calpain-specific spectrin breakdown products (SBDP). Protease-specific SBDP revealed the formation of calpain-generated 150kDa product in the infected cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The specific signature fragment of calpain activation and spectrin breakdown after Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection provide a strong evidence of the role of calpains during the cell death in cerebral cortex and cerebellum.

However, the pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have many functions, including inhibition of apoptosis and necrosis, protection from oxidative stress, and maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, that are related to neurodegenerative diseases. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)) is a neurotoxin that selectively inhibits the mitochondrial functions of DA neurons in the substantia nigra. MPP(+) administration is accepted as a model for PD. In the present study, we found that MPP(+) induced a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability. Lower concentrations of MPP(+) induced mainly early apoptosis, and, as the concentration increased, the number of late apoptotic and necrotic cells significantly increased. However, treated by heat shock preconditioning or transfection with HDJ-1, a homologue of human Hsp40, cells showed marked improvement in viability after exposure to the same concentrations of MPP(+). Compared with heat shock, HDJ-1 appeared to improve cell viability obviously. Similarly, HDJ-1 elicited significantly stronger protective effects against apoptosis and necrosis. In addition, HDJ-1 transfection maintained more injured cells in early apoptotic stages and inhibited the occurrence of late apoptotic/necrotic events. Heat shock and HDJ-1 both ameliorated MPP(+)-induced cytotoxicity by maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the effects of HSPs, such as reducing apoptosis and necrosis, preserving mitochondrial functions and decreasing oxidative stress, may bring a novel approach for PD therapy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We have shown previously that spinal motor neurons are more vulnerable to proteasome inhibition-induced neurotoxicity, using a dissociated culture system. To confirm this toxicity, we used organotypic slice cultures from rat neonatal spinal cords, which conserve the structure of the spinal cord in a horizontal plane, enabling us to identify motor neurons more accurately than in dissociated cultures. Furthermore, such easy identifications make it possible to follow up the course of the degeneration of motor neurons. When a specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (5 microM), was applied to slice cultures, proteasome activity of a whole slice was suppressed below 30% of control. Motor neurons were selectively damaged, especially in neurites, with the increase of phosphorylated neurofilaments. They were eventually lost in a dose-dependent manner (1 microM, P &lt; 0.05; 5 microM, P &lt; 0.01). The low capacity of Ca(2+) buffering is believed to be one of the factors of selectivity for damaged motor neurons in ALS. In our system, negative staining of Ca(2+)-binding proteins supported this notion. An intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, BAPTA-AM (10 microM), exerted a significant protective effect when it was applied with lactacystin simultaneously (P &lt; 0.01). We postulate that proteasome inhibition is an excellent model for studying the mechanisms underlying selective motor neuron death and searching for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ALS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We previously showed that VCP(K524A), an ATPase activity-negative VCP mutant, induced vacuolization, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, and cell death, phenotypes commonly observed in neurodegenerative disorders. However, any regulatory mechanism of its ATPase activity has not yet been clarified. Here, we show that oxidative stress readily inactivates VCP ATPase activity. With liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, we found that at least three cysteine residues were modified by oxidative stress. Of them, the 522nd cysteine (Cys-522) was identified as the site responsible for the oxidative inactivation of VCP. VCP(C522T), a single-amino acid substitution mutant from cysteine to threonine, conferred almost complete resistance to the oxidative inactivation. In response to oxidative stress, VCP strengthened the interaction with Npl4 and Ufd1, both of which are essential in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. Cys-522 is located in the second ATP binding motif and is highly conserved in multicellular but not unicellular organisms. Cdc48p (yeast VCP) has threonine in the corresponding amino acid, and it showed resistance to the oxidative inactivation in vitro. Furthermore, a yeast mutant (delta cdc48 + cdc48[T532C]) was shown to be susceptible to oxidants-induced growth inhibition and cell death. These results clearly demonstrate that VCP ATPase activity is regulated by the oxidative modification of the Cys-522 residue.

The mitochondrial involvement in neurodegenerative diseases reflects the regulatory role mitochondrial failure plays in both necrotic cell death and apoptosis. The potent feminizing hormone, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), is neuroprotective in a host of cell and animal models of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery that 17alpha-estradiol, an isomer of E2, is equally as neuroprotective as E2 yet is &gt;200-fold less active as a hormone, has permitted development of novel, more potent analogs where neuroprotection is independent of hormonal potency. Studies of structure-activity relationships and mitochondrial function have led to a mechanistic model in which these steroidal phenols intercalate into cell membranes where they block lipid peroxidation reactions, and are in turn recycled. Indeed, the parental estrogens and novel analogs stabilize mitochondria under Ca(2+) loading otherwise sufficient to collapse membrane potential. The neuroprotective and mitoprotective potencies for a series of estrogen analogs are significantly correlated, suggesting that these compounds prevent cell death in large measure by maintaining functionally intact mitochondria. This therapeutic strategy is germane not only to sudden mitochondrial failure in acute circumstances, such as during a stroke or myocardial infarction, but also to gradual mitochondrial dysfunction associated with chronic degenerative disorders such as AD.</AbstractText>"}

The generation of new neurons in neurogenic regions, such as the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, is affected by these aggregation processes. In particular, hippocampal neurogenesis is reduced in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. Since physical activity stimulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we examined whether running is capable to rescue the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in R6/2 mice. Proliferation of hippocampal cells measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) marker was reduced in R6/2 animals by 64% compared to wild type mice. Accordingly, newly generated neurons labeled with doublecortin (DCX) were diminished by 60% in the hippocampus of R6/2 mice. Furthermore, the number of newly generated mature neurons was decreased by 76%. Within the hippocampus of wild type animals, a four-week running period resulted in a doubling of PCNA-, DCX-, and bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells. However, physical exercise failed to stimulate proliferation and survival of newly generated neurons in R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. These findings suggest that mutant huntingtin alters the hippocampal microenvironment thus resulting in an impaired neurogenesis. Importantly, this adverse microenvironment impeded neurogenesis upregulation such as induced by physical exercise. Future studies need to decipher the molecular pathways involved in repressing the generation of new neurons after physical activity in huntingtin transgenic rodents.</AbstractText>"}

At least two 'lethal' scenarios are proposed; first, the host cell destruction from the 'inside out' by small caliber cystic forms invading the host cell cytoplasm, and second host cell destruction by engulfment of entire host cells by large caliber cystic spirochetal forms. Conventional thinking about spirochetal cyst forms is divided between two polar spheres of influence; one a majority community that completely denies the existence of spirochetal cyst forms, and a second group of academically persecuted individuals who accepts the precepts of such antebellum scientists as Schaudinn, Hoffman, Dutton, Levaditi, Balfour, Fantham, Noguchi, McDonough, Hindle, Steiner, Ingraham, Coutts, Hampp, Warthin, Ovcinnikov, and Delamater. Microscopic images of cystic spirochetes are difficult to ignore, but as has been the case in this century, academic 'endowments' have nearly expunged all cystic spirochetal image data from the current textbook versions of what is the truth about the spirochetaceae. If the image database from the last century is obliterated; many opportunities to diagnose will be lost. Variously sized cystic spirochetal profiles within diseased nerve cells explain the following structures: Lewy body of Parkinson's disease, Pick body, ALS spherical body, Alzheimer plaque. Borrelia infection is therefore a unifying concept to explain diverse neurodegenerative diseases, based not entirely on a corkscrew shaped profile in diseased tissue, but based on small, medium and large caliber rounded cystic profiles derived from pathogenic spirochetes which are...'hiding in plain sight'.</AbstractText>"}

Our recent study has revealed that the SCA14 mutant gammaPKC is susceptible to aggregation and causes cell death.

Although more reliable etiological mutations of RP11 were subsequently discovered in a human homologue of yeast pre-mRNA splicing gene (PRP31), the role of this R659S missense change in the pathogenicity of RP11 is still controversial. In this study, we overexpressed R659S gammaPKC in CHO cells and characterized the properties of this mutant protein. We found that R659S gammaPKC more prominently induced cell death than did wild-type. This mutant gammaPKC had higher basal activity than wild-type, however, no difference was found in the extent of aggregation and insolubility to detergent between R659S mutant and wild-type. These results suggest that the R659S mutation is susceptible to neuronal death and is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including RP11.</AbstractText>"}

AD is characterized by the presence of excessive deposits of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which are derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) following processing by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Recently, we have reported that developmental exposure of rats to Pb resulted in latent elevation of APP mRNA, APP, and Abeta in old age. Here we examined whether latent up-regulation in APP expression and Abeta levels is exacerbated by concurrent disturbances in APP processing or Abeta aggregation. Among the environmental metals tested, only Abeta solutions containing Pb promoted the formation of Abeta aggregates at nanomolar concentrations. The lifetime profiles of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases remained constant in adult and aging animals, and developmental exposure to Pb did not alter them. Furthermore, the addition of various concentrations of Pb (0.1 to 50 microM) to cerebral cortical extracts derived from control animals also did not affect the proteolytic activities of these enzymes. Therefore, we propose that amyloidogenesis is promoted by a latent response to developmental reprogramming of the expression of the APP gene by early exposure to Pb, as well as enhancement of Abeta aggregation in old age. In rodents, these events occur without Pb-induced disturbances to the enzymatic processing of APP. The aforementioned results provide further evidence for the developmental basis of amyloidogenesis and late-life disturbances in AD-associated proteins by environmental agents.</AbstractText>"}

Glutamate-induced cytotoxicity was associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the death executioner caspases 1 and 3. Treatment of HT22 cells with the calcium chelator, EGTA, and the calcium channel blocker, CoCl2, revealed that glutamate-induced cell death was dependent, in part, on glutamate-induced Ca2+ influx from extracellular stores. However, activation of caspases 1 and 3 and death of HT22 cells were also observed when Ca2+ was lacking in the extracellular milieu and ROS production abrogated. These findings led us to conclude that glutamate-induced death of mouse HT22 cells utilizes a complex mechanism that relies only in part on Ca2+ influx and ROS production.

The molecular basis of such selective susceptibility within the same milieu remains largely unknown. Neurons are rarely infected by the virus. However, they are vulnerable to viral products, like HIV-1 coat protein gp120. Interestingly, gp120 induced oxidative stress in neurons, but not in astroglia. This led us to postulate that astroglia were armed with a more efficient antioxidant system than neurons. Here, we report that the constitutive level of MnSOD (SOD2), the major cellular antioxidant enzyme, is significantly higher in astroglia than in neurons. Furthermore, gp120 treatment enhanced MnSOD levels in astroglia but decreased the same in neurons. This increase in astroglial MnSOD was dependent on NF-kappaB, the crucial transcription factor required for sod2 gene transcription. Blocking NF-kappaB with p65-antisense, p65-si-RNA, or a specific inhibitor, NBD peptide, led to reduced MnSOD levels and enhanced vulnerability of astroglia to gp120. Additionally, neurons were found to have a lower constitutive level of NF-kappaB p65 than astrocytes. Overexpression of p65 increased the level of MnSOD in neurons. This, in turn, elicited greater neuronal resistance to gp120. Taken together, our study suggests that astroglia manifest a higher threshold for gp120-induced lethality than neurons due to greater MnSOD availability, which is demonstrated due to greater level of NF-kappaB p65.</AbstractText>"}

Further metabolic deficits were defined in all regions at earlier time points, including the cerebellum, where very little neurological degeneration has been reported. Biochemical abnormalities in the CSF of affected sheep at 18-31 months include relative increases in lactate, acetate, tyrosine, and creatine/creatinine concentrations and decreases in myo- and scyllo-inositol and citrate concentrations. The changes detected in the CSF and brain tissue mirrored those previously apparent in NCL mouse models, suggesting that they are common to all NCLs. However, the changes in glutamate and glutamine concentrations in CSF occurred after clinical disease, indicating that any changes in glutamate/glutamine cycling occur as a consequence of the primary deficits associated with the NCLs.</AbstractText>"}

These findings suggest novel mechanisms whereby lithium treatment could ameliorate tauopathies including AD.

With the increase of life expectancy in human species, ageing has become a major concern for the society, both at the human and financial level. The main challenge for biologists studying ageing is to understand how the multiple effects quoted above, so easily identifiable in various species, are nonetheless so coordinate among individuals of a given species. The acquisition of this fundamental knowledge will be essential to reach the ultimate goal of healthy ageing for human populations. At the present time, three types of recent developments on ageing research can be distinguished: 1) A consensus on evolutionist theory of ageing is developing. This theory is based on the fact that long-lived species usually arise from protected ecological niches. It implies that phenotypes which are expressed late in 'aged survivors' are beyond natural selection. So, alleles underlying this late expression being adaptive or not ('good' or 'bad'), contribute only slightly to the pool of genes of the following generation. 2) Study of laboratory models like the nematode C. elegans or fly D. melanogaster have enabled the observation that single-gene invalidation can increase lifespan. Interestingly, some of these changes seem to imply a common process through insulin/IGF-1 (insulin like growth factor-I) orthologue, energy metabolism and growth implicated hormones, as well as protection against free radicals. 3) In the mouse, several genes mutation increase lifespan and are associated with a decrease in growth hormone (GH) secretion as well as its main effector IGF-1. The study of such transgenic mutants, in parallel with the well-known effect of the caloric restriction on ageing, open several tracks which should allow determining common mechanisms which regulate the mammalian lifespan.</AbstractText>"}

This is a rare and usually fatal neurodegenerative disorder whose pathological hallmark is the abundance of protein aggregates in astrocytes. These aggregates, termed 'Rosenthal fibers,' contain the protein chaperones alpha B-crystallin and HSP27 as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament (IF) protein found almost exclusively in astrocytes. Heterozygous, missense GFAP mutations that usually arise spontaneously during spermatogenesis have recently been found in the majority of patients with Alexander disease. In this study, we show that one of the more frequently observed mutations, R416W, significantly perturbs in vitro filament assembly. The filamentous structures formed resemble assembly intermediates but aggregate more strongly. Consistent with the heterozygosity of the mutation, this effect is dominant over wild-type GFAP in coassembly experiments. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that R416W GFAP induces the formation of GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in a wide range of different cell types, including astrocytes. The aggregates have several important features in common with Rosenthal fibers, including the association of alpha B-crystallin and HSP27. This association occurs simultaneously with the formation of protein aggregates containing R416W GFAP and is also specific, since HSP70 does not partition with them. Monoclonal antibodies specific for R416W GFAP reveal, for the first time for any IF-based disease, the presence of the mutant protein in the characteristic histopathological feature of the disease, namely Rosenthal fibers. Collectively, these data confirm that the effects of the R416W GFAP are dominant, changing the assembly process in a way that encourages aberrant filament-filament interactions that then lead to protein aggregation and chaperone sequestration as early events in Alexander disease.</AbstractText>"}

Changes in NT expression levels have thus been implicated in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of memory and deterioration of higher cognitive functions.

Here I present a molecular mechanism that can explain how acquired information in humans in a DNA independent mode becomes innate and heritable. The model is based on self-replicating protein conformations, a concept derived from prion and amyloid biology. Information is stored in specific beta-sheet protein conformations that can act as cytoplasmic molecular memories. The conformational information can be transmitted to next generations in a non-nucleic acid based inheritance system utilizing the self-perpetuating potential of such beta-rich protein aggregates. Chaperones play a crucial role in the model by regulating and balancing the process of folding and misfolding; they also assist in preventing the development of aggregation-based disease. The protein conformation-mediated information system could represent an evolutionary conserved primordial mechanism: while the main strategy has been to ensure rapid folding of polypeptides into the native, functional conformation, the disfolded, beta-rich amyloidogenic state has provided advantage by providing a cytoplasmic, protease-resistant self-perpetuating DNA-independent adaptive inheritance system. The model offers an explanation for the problematic question of the evolution of complex behavioural traits and has even impact in the context of mammalian cloning: the protein conformation-based information localized in the somatic cytoplasm is lost when transferring nuclei only into enucleated oocytes. The protein conformation-based model presented herein postulates that proteins may contain much more information than determined by the nucleotide-triplet controlled peptide sequence and that there exists cross-talk and information exchange between proteins.</AbstractText>"}

The onset of symptoms usually begins in middle age, although approximately 5% become symptomatic as juveniles. Death occurs approximately 15 years following the onset of symptoms, which include choreic movements, cognitive decline and psychiatric changes. HD is an autosomal dominant inherited disease that is associated with an expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat located on chromosome 4. Physicians rely on a positive family history, and diagnostic and genetic tests to detect the expansion in the number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HD gene to confirm the diagnosis. More than 99% of HD patients have 40 or more CAG triplet repeats and, therefore, targeted mutational analysis is greater than 99% sensitive. Individuals with 26 triplet repeats or less are normal, and while those with 27-35 repeats may not demonstrate symptoms themselves, their offspring may have the disease. Individuals with 36-39 repeats may or may not exhibit symptoms. The College of American Pathology/American College of Medical Genetics Biochemical and Molecular Genetics Resource Committee has emphasized the need to standardize the methodology for the determination of the accurate number of CAG repeats. This will prevent false-positive or -negative results when conducting predictive or prenatal testing of at-risk individuals. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a standard reference material to provide these positive and negative controls needed by clinical testing laboratories. The use of a HD standard reference material will provide the quality control and assurance that data from different laboratories are both comparable and accurate.</AbstractText>"}

Furthermore, the elderly require special consideration with respect to drug delivery, drug interactions and adherence. In particular, patients with chronic neurological diseases often require multiple administration of drugs during the day to maintain constant plasma medication levels, which in turn increases the likelihood of poor adherence. Consequently, several attempts have been made to develop pharmacological preparations that can achieve a constant rate of drug delivery. For example, transdermal lisuride and apomorphine have been shown to reduce motor fluctuations and duration of 'off' periods in advanced Parkinson's disease, while rotigotine allows significant down-titration of levodopa without severe adverse effects. Thus, parkinsonian patients with long-term levodopa syndrome or motor disorders during sleep could benefit from use of transdermal lisuride and apomorphine. Moreover, transdermal dopaminergic drugs, particularly rotigotine, seem the ideal treatment for patients experiencing restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder during sleep, disorders that are quite common in elderly people or in association with neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike dopaminergic drugs, transdermal treatments for the management of cognitive and behavioural dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease have inconsistent effects and no clearly established role. Nevertheless, because of their favourable pharmacological profile and bioavailability, the cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and rivastigmine are expected to show at least the same benefits as oral formulations of these drugs, but with fewer severe adverse effects. Transdermal delivery systems play an important role in the management of neuropathic pain. The transdermal lidocaine (lignocaine) patch is recommended as first-line therapy for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Furthermore, in patients with severe persistent pain, transdermal delivery systems using the opioids fentanyl and buprenorphine are able to achieve satisfactory analgesia with good tolerability, comparable to the benefits seen with oral formulations. Transdermal administration is the ideal therapeutic approach for chronic neurological disorders in elderly people because it provides sustained therapeutic plasma levels of drugs, is simple to use, and may reduce systemic adverse effects. Several transdermal delivery systems are currently under investigation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and neuropathic pain. Although most transdermal delivery systems treatments cannot be considered as first-line therapy at present, some of them provide clear advantages compared with other routes of administration and may become the preferred treatment in selected patients. In general, however, most transdermal treatments still require long-term evaluation in large patient groups in order to optimise dosages and evaluate the actual incidence of local and systemic adverse effects.</AbstractText>"}

The cellular mechanism underlying the pathogenic effect of these mutations remains uncertain. To investigate whether pathogenic mutations impair a normal, physiological activity of PrP, we have crossed Tg(PG14) mice, which express PrP with an octapeptide insertion associated with an inherited prion dementia, with Tg(PrPDelta32-134) mice. Tg(PrPDelta32-134) mice, which express an N-terminally truncated form of PrP, spontaneously develop a neurodegenerative phenotype that is stoichiometrically reversed by coexpression of wild-type PrP. We find that, at equivalent expression levels, PG14 PrP is significantly less efficient than wild-type PrP in suppressing the development of clinical symptoms and neuropathology in Tg(PrPDelta32-134) mice. Thus, our results suggest that some features of the neurological illness associated with inherited PrP mutations may be attributable to a loss of PrP neuroprotective function.

The pattern of protection of the ketogenic diet in animal models of seizures is distinct from that of other anticonvulsants, suggesting that it has a unique mechanism of action. During consumption of the ketogenic diet, marked alterations in brain energy metabolism occur, with ketone bodies partly replacing glucose as fuel. Whether these metabolic changes contribute to acute seizure protection is unclear; however, the ketone body acetone has anticonvulsant activity and could play a role in the seizure protection afforded by the diet. In addition to acute seizure protection, the ketogenic diet provides protection against the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in models of chronic epilepsy, and it has neuroprotective properties in diverse models of neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText>"}

One of the major persistent obstacles to the successful implementation of therapeutic ESC transplantation is the propensity of ESC-derived grafts to form tumors in vivo. To address this problem, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to purify mouse ESC-derived neural precursors expressing the neural precursor marker Sox1. ESC-derived, Sox1+ cells began to express neuronal cell markers and differentiated into DA neurons upon transplantation into mouse brains but did not generate tumors in this site. In contrast, Sox1- cells that expressed ESC markers frequently formed tumors in vivo. These results indicate that Sox1-based cell sorting of neural precursors prevents graft-derived tumor formation after transplantation, providing a promising strategy for cell transplantation therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

In the U.S., stem cells found in the umbilical cord are routinely placed into bio-hazardous waste after birth. Here, stem cells derived from human umbilical cord Wharton's Jelly, called umbilical cord matrix stem (UCMS) cells, are characterized. UCMS cells have several properties that make them of interest as a source of cells for therapeutic use. For example, they 1) can be isolated in large numbers, 2) are negative for CD34 and CD45, 3) grow robustly and can be frozen/thawed, 4) can be clonally expanded, and 5) can easily be engineered to express exogenous proteins. UCMS cells have genetic and surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells (positive for CD10, CD13, CD29, CD44, and CD90 and negative for CD14, CD33, CD56, CD31, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR) and appear to be stable in terms of their surface marker expression in early passage (passages 4-8). Unlike traditional mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult bone marrow stromal cells, small populations of UCMS cells express endoglin (SH2, CD105) and CD49e at passage 8. UCMS cells express growth factors and angiogenic factors, suggesting that they may be used to treat neurodegenerative disease. To test the therapeutic value of UCMS cells, undifferentiated human UCMS cells were transplanted into the brains of hemiparkinsonian rats that were not immune-suppressed. UCMS cells ameliorated apomorphine-induced rotations in the pilot test. UCMS cells transplanted into normal rats did not produce brain tumors, rotational behavior, or a frank host immune rejection response. In summary, the umbilical cord matrix appears to be a rich, noncontroversial, and inexhaustible source of primitive mesenchymal stem cells.</AbstractText>"}

The misfolded and aggregated proteins are inducers of cellular stress and activators of immunity in neurodegenerative diseases. They might possess clear cytotoxic properties, being responsible for the dysfunction and loss of cells in the affected organs. Despite the crucial importance of protein misfolding and abnormal interactions, very little is currently known about the molecular mechanism underlying these processes. Factors that lead to protein misfolding and aggregation in vitro are poorly understood, not to mention the complexities involved in the formation of protein nanoparticles with different morphologies (e.g., the nanopores) in vivo. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of misfolding and aggregation might facilitate development of the rational approaches to prevent pathologies mediated by protein misfolding. The conventional tools currently available to researchers can only provide an averaged picture of a living system, whereas much of the subtle or short-lived information is lost. We believe that the existing and emerging nanotools might help solving these problems by opening the entirely novel pathways for the development of early diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This article summarizes recent advances of the nanoscience in detection and characterization of misfolded protein conformations. Based on these findings, we outline our view on the nanoscience development towards identification intracellular nanomachines and/or multicomponent complexes critically involved in protein misfolding.</AbstractText>"}

The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..).

The small molecule neurotransmitter dopamine has been shown to regulate cell cycle in developing and adult brain, and the D3 receptor is known to play an important role in dopaminergic development. Pharmacological activation of the dopamine D3 receptor has been shown to trigger neurogenesis in the substantia nigra of the adult rat brain. Here, we examined the cell proliferative, neurogenic, and behavioral effects of the dopamine D3 receptor agonist 7-OH-DPAT (7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin) in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease. Consistent with previous findings, we observed a significant induction of cell proliferation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN(C)) with a time-dependent adoption of a neuronal dopaminergic phenotype in many of these cells. Indices of nigrostriatal integrity were also affected. Dopaminergic cell counts in the lesioned SN(C) recovered substantially in a time-dependent manner. Similarly, retrograde tracing revealed a restoration of striatal innervation from these cells, with evidence for projections arising from newly generated cells. Finally, we observed a substantial and persistent recovery of locomotor function in these animals. The results of these studies will further our understanding of the environmental signals regulating neurogenesis in the adult brain and could have significant implications for the design of novel treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

An entire field of research of neuroprotection and restoration has opened up as part of the search for additional ways of slowing disease progression. We have proposed, on the basis of experimental evidence, that a vaccine could be a means of recruiting the immune system to help eliminate many of the factors associated with glaucomatous neurodegeneration and thus prevent disease progression, though not its onset. This immune defence involves lymphocytes, resident and infiltrating innate immune cells, the microglia, and macrophages. The antigens of choice are synthetic antigens, such as glatiramer acetate, that weakly cross-react with self-antigens in the retina and optic nerves. The vaccine induces a beneficial immune response that recruits immune effector cells to counteract or neutralize many of the compounds and factors that contribute to ongoing destruction, and in addition supports cell renewal and repair.</AbstractText>"}

An alternative would be the combination of agents which already have some proven efficacy in MS therapy, are directed against different mechanisms of the pathogenic chain, and ideally result in synergic effects and a profile of reduced toxicity.

Apn1 is a yeast enzyme in this pathway which possesses a wider substrate specificity and greater enzyme activity than its mammalian counterpart for removing DNA damage, making it a good therapeutic candidate. For this study we targeted Apn1 to mitochondria in a neuronal cell line derived from the substantia nigra by using a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) in an effort to hasten the removal of DNA damage and thereby protect these cells. We found that following oxidative stress, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was repaired more efficiently in cells containing Apn1 with the MTS than controls. There was no difference in nuclear repair. However, cells that expressed Apn1 without the MTS showed enhanced repair of both nuclear and mtDNA. Both Apn1-expressing cells were more resistant to cell death following oxidative stress compared with controls.

To assess whether similar mechanisms regulate K(ir)3 function in mammalian cells, we developed and characterized a phosphoselective antibody recognizing K(ir)3.1 phosphorylated at tyrosine 12 in the N-terminal domain and then probed for evidence of K(ir)3.1 phosphorylation in cultured mammalian cells and spinal cord. The antibody was found to discriminate between the phospho-Tyr(12) of K(ir)3.1 and the native state in transfected cell lines and in primary cultures of mouse atria. Following either mouse hindpaw formalin injection or sciatic nerve ligation, pY12-K(ir)3.1 immunoreactivity was enhanced unilaterally in the superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn, regions previously described as expressing K(ir)3.1 channels.

We further examined the linkage data considering the proposed linkages to chromosome 9 (D9S741) and chromosome 10 (alpha-catenin gene). There was a modest (P=0.20) increase in the LOD score for D12S368 (MLOD=1.70) when using the D9S741 LOD scores as a covariate and a highly significant (P&lt;0.001) increase in the MLOD score (4.19) for D12S1701 in autopsy-confirmed families (n=228) when using alpha-catenin LOD scores as a covariate.

We address this by generating transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human tau exclusively in OLGs using the 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase promoter. Filamentous OLG tau inclusions developed in these Tg mice as a result of human tau expression in OLGs, especially those expressing the FTDP-17 human P301L mutant tau. Notably, structural disruption of myelin and axons preceded the emergence of thioflavin-S positive tau inclusions in OLGs, but impairments in axonal transport occurred even earlier, whereas motor deficits developed subsequently, especially in Tg mice with the highest tau expression levels.

The disease is due to mutations in either of two genes, NPC1, which encodes a transmembrane protein related to the Hedgehog receptor Patched, and NPC2, which encodes a secreted cholesterol-binding protein. Npc1 mutant mice can be partially rescued by treatment with specific steroids. We have created a Drosophila NPC model by mutating dnpc1a, one of two Drosophila genes related to mammalian NPC1. Cells throughout the bodies of dnpc1a mutants accumulated sterol in a punctate pattern, as in individuals with NPC1 mutations. The mutants developed only to the first larval stage and were unable to molt. Molting after the normal first instar period was restored to various degrees by feeding the mutants the steroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, or the precursors of ecdysone biosynthesis, cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol. dnpc1a is normally highly expressed in the ecdysone-producing ring gland. Ring gland-specific expression of dnpc1a in otherwise mutant flies allowed development to adulthood, suggesting that the lack of ecdysone in the mutants is the cause of death. We propose that dnpc1a mutants have sterols trapped in aberrant organelles, leading to a shortage of sterol in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or mitochondria of ring gland cells, and, consequently, inadequate ecdysone synthesis.</AbstractText>"}

AT3 increases the level of CD3delta by decreasing its degradation; pathogenic AT3 decreases degradation to a greater extent than wild-type AT3. Knock-down of endogenous AT3 decreases levels of CD3delta, suggesting that a normal function of AT3 is to regulate levels of ERAD substrates. AT3 binds VCP/p97, a key protein responsible for extracting ERAD substrates from the ER; binding is modulated by the size of the polyglutamine tract, and mutating a sequence adjacent to the polyglutamine tract inhibits the AT3-VCP interaction and AT3-dependent accumulation of CD3delta. AT3 and Ufd1 bind VCP in a mutually exclusive manner; AT3 decreases the interaction of VCP with Ufd1 as well as with ubiquitylated proteins. Using a reconstituted system, AT3 inhibits retrotranslocation of an ERAD substrate from the ER. These data suggest that a normal function of AT3 is to regulate flow through the ERAD pathway by modulating VCP-dependent extraction of proteins from the ER.</AbstractText>"}

The PBR binds to high-affinity drug ligands and cholesterol. Many functions are associated directly or indirectly with the PBR, including the regulation of cholesterol transport and the synthesis of steroid hormones, porphyrin transport and heme synthesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, anion transport, regulation of mitochondrial functions and immunomodulation. Based on these functions, there are many potential clinical applications of PBR modulation, such as in oncologic, endocrine, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Although 'PBR' is a widely used and accepted name in the scientific community, recent data regarding the structure and molecular function of this protein increasingly support renaming it to represent more accurately its subcellular role (or roles) and putative tissue-specific function (or functions). Translocator protein (18kDa) is proposed as a new name, regardless of the subcellular localization of the protein.</AbstractText>"}

A virtual combinatorial library composed of diverse combinations of two substituted groups was constructed using Project Library, followed by an automated screening of the library against the ligand binding site on FKBP52 using DOCK. Forty-three candidate compounds that displayed favorable binding with the receptor were identified and synthesized. The neurotrophic activity of the candidate compounds was evaluated on chick dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. As a result, 15 compounds exhibited positive effects on ganglion neurite outgrowth in the presence of 0.15 ng/mL NGF, among which 7 compounds at testing concentrations of 1 pM and 100 pM showed greater efficacy than 1 at 100 pM. Compound 18 (3-(3-pyridyl)-1-propyl (2S)-5,5-dimethyl-1-(3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dioxobutyl)-2-(4-thiazolidine)carboxylate) afforded the most potent effect in promoting the processes of neurite outgrowth and which was in a concentration-dependent manner from 1 pM to 100 pM.

A relationship between amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and a decrease in the cytoplasmatic levels of beta-catenin has been proposed. Also, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3beta), a central modulator of the pathway, protects rat hippocampal neurons from Abeta-induced damage. Interestingly, during the progression of AD, it has been described that active GSK-3beta is found in neuronal cell bodies and neurites, co-localizing with pre-neurofibrillary tangles observed in disease brains. Since Abeta oligomers are associated with the post-synaptic region and we have found that the non-canonical Wnt signaling modulates PSD-95 and glutamate receptors, we propose that the synaptic target for Abeta oligomers in AD is the postsynaptic region and at the molecular level is the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Altogether, our evidence suggests that a sustained loss of Wnt signaling function may be involved in the Abeta-dependent neurodegeneration observed in AD brains and that the activation of this signaling pathway could be of therapeutic interest in AD.</AbstractText>"}

NMDARs are obligate heteromultimers typically composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits with the different subunits underlying the functional versatility of NMDARs. To study the contribution of the different subunits to NMDAR channel structure and gating, we compared the effects of cysteine-reactive agents on cysteines substituted in and around the M1, M3, and M4 segments of the NR1 and NR2C subunits. Based on the voltage dependence of cysteine modification, we find that, both in NR1 and NR2C, M3 appears to be the only transmembrane segment that contributes to the deep (or voltage dependent) portion of the ion channel pore. This contribution, however, is subunit specific with more positions in NR1 than in NR2C facing the central pore. Complimentarily, NR2C makes a greater contribution than NR1 to the shallow (or voltage independent) portion of the pore with more NR2C positions in pre-M1 and M3-S2 linker lining the ion-conducting pathway. Substituted cysteines in the M3 segments in NR1 and NR2C showed strong, albeit different, state-dependent reactivity, suggesting that they play central but structurally distinct roles in gating. A weaker state dependence was observed for the pre-M1 regions in both subunits. Compared to M1 and M3, the M4 segments in both NR1 and NR2C subunits had limited accessibility and the weakest state dependence, suggesting that they are peripheral to the central pore. Finally, we propose that Lurcher mutation-like effects, which were identified in and around all three transmembrane segments, occur for positions located at dynamic protein-protein or protein-lipid interfaces that have state-dependent accessibility to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents and therefore can affect the equilibrium between open and closed states following reactions with MTS reagents.</AbstractText>"}

Some familial cases (fALS) are linked to mutations of superoxide dismutase type-1 (SOD1), an antioxidant enzyme whose activity is preserved in most mutant forms. Owing to the similarities in sporadic and fALS forms, mutant SOD1 animal and cellular models are a useful tool to study the disease. In transgenic mice expressing either wild-type (wt) human SOD1 or mutant G93A-SOD1, we found that wtSOD1 was present in cytoplasm and in nuclei of motoneurons, whereas mutant SOD1 was mainly cytoplasmic. Similar results were obtained in immortalized motoneurons (NSC34 cells) expressing either wtSOD1 or G93A-SOD1. Analyzing the proteasome activity, responsible for misfolded protein clearance, in the two subcellular compartments, we found proteasome impairment only in the cytoplasm. The effect of G93A-SOD1 exclusion from nuclei was then analyzed after oxidative stress. Cells expressing G93A-SOD1 showed a higher DNA damage compared with those expressing wtSOD1, possibly because of a loss of nuclear protection. The toxicity of mutant SOD1 might, therefore, arise from an initial misfolding (gain of function) reducing nuclear protection from the active enzyme (loss of function in the nuclei), a process that may be involved in ALS pathogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Minocycline passes the blood-brain barrier and is presumed to inhibit microglial activation. In Alzheimer's disease brain, a number of proteins, including serum amyloid P component (SAP) and complement factors such as C1q, accumulate in amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques. In a previous study, SAP and C1q were found to be required for clustering of activated microglia in Abeta plaques. Furthermore, SAP and C1q enhanced Abeta fibril formation and Abeta mediated cytokine release by human microglia in vitro. In the present study, we report that tetracycline and minocycline dose-dependently reduce TNF-alpha and IL-6 release by adult human microglia upon stimulation with a combination of Abeta, SAP, and C1q. In addition, minocycline and to a lesser extent tetracycline inhibit fibril formation of Abeta as determined in a thioflavin-S-based fluorescence test. This inhibitory effect was observed with Abeta alone as well as with Abeta in combination with SAP and C1q. Our data suggest that minocycline and tetracycline at tolerable doses can inhibit human microglial activation. This activity in part is exerted by inhibition of (SAP and C1q enhanced) Abeta fibril formation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Biosynthetic pathways seem to be identical. Actions are pleiotropic, mediated by membrane and nuclear receptors, other binding sites or chemical interactions. Melatonin regulates the sleep/wake cycle, other circadian and seasonal rhythms, and acts as an immunostimulator and cytoprotective agent. Circulating melatonin is mostly 6-hydroxylated by hepatic P450 monooxygenases and excreted as 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. Pyrrole-ring cleavage is of higher importance in other tissues, especially the brain. The product, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine, is formed by enzymatic, pseudoenzymatic, photocatalytic, and numerous free-radical reactions. Additional metabolites result from hydroxylation and nitrosation. The secondary metabolite, N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine, supports mitochondrial function and downregulates cyclooxygenase 2. Antioxidative protection, safeguarding of mitochondrial electron flux, and in particular, neuroprotection, have been demonstrated in many experimental systems. Findings are encouraging to use melatonin as a sleep promoter and in preventing progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

It is also clear that SMA is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of the alpha-motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and atrophy of the associated skeletal muscle. What is more controversial is whether it is neuronal and/or muscle-cell-autonomous defects that are responsible for the disease per se. Although motor neuron degeneration is generally accepted as the primary event in SMA, intrinsic muscle defects in this disease have not been ruled out. To gain a better understanding of the influence of SMN protein dosage in muscle, we have generated a hypomorphic series of myoblast (C2C12) stable cell lines with variable Smn knockdown. We show that depletion of Smn in these cells resulted in a decrease in the number of nuclear 'gems' (gemini of coiled bodies), reduced proliferation with no increase in cell death, defects in myoblast fusion, and malformed myotubes. Importantly, the severity of these abnormalities is directly correlated with the decrease in Smn dosage.

However, 81% of stage III/IV breast cancers were positive for SNCG expression, while only 15% of stage I/II breast cancers were positive for SNCG expression. In contrast, SNCG was undetectable in benign breast lesions. Expression of SNCG in the primary tumor also significantly associated with lymph node involvement and metastasis. There was no significant correlation between SNCG gene expression and age, menstruation, and status of ER, PR, PCNA, and HER-2. Patients whose tumors expressed SNCG had a significantly shorter DFS and a high probability of death when compared with those whose tumors did not express SNCG.

We herein review the current literature on the pharmacological effects of ginsenosides on the modulation of angiogenesis, dysregulations of which contribute towards many pathological conditions. Regarding the adaptogenic property of ginseng, the effects of ginsenosides on central nervous system are also discussed. Recent researches have pointed to the steroid hormone receptors as the target molecules to elicit the diverse cellular and physiological activities of ginseng.

This insufficiency of blood-brain barrier may allow entry of uncellular blood components such as different fragments of amyloid precursor protein and cellular blood components like leukocytes and platelets into the brain parenchyma. These blood components may have chronic harmful effects on the ischemic neuronal cells, axons and myelin and can intensify and finish the neuropathology in ischemic brain parenchyma. Pathological accumulation of different toxic fragments of amyloid precursor protein in extracellular space and myelinated axons appears after ischemic blood-brain barrier injury and seem to be concomitant with, but independent of neuronal ischemic cytoplasmic injury. It seems that ischemic blood-brain barrier disturbances may play an important, both direct and indirect role in the pathogenesis of extra- and intracellular space in gray and white matter lesions following ischemic episode. This neuropathology appears to have similar character and distribution as in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. This review presented chronic micro-blood-brain barrier openings in ischemic gray and white matter lesions that probably would act as seeds of future Alzheimer's amyloid plaques.</AbstractText>"}

The inflammatory response is mediated by the activated microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, which normally respond to neuronal damage and remove the damaged cells by phagocytosis. Activation of microglia is a hallmark of brain pathology. However, it remains controversial whether microglial cells have beneficial or detrimental functions in various neuropathological conditions. The chronic activation of microglia may in turn cause neuronal damage through the release of potentially cytotoxic molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, proteinases and complement proteins. Therefore, suppression of microglia-mediated inflammation has been considered as an important strategy in neurodegenerative disease therapy. Several anti-inflammatory drugs of various chemical ingredients have been shown to repress the microglial activation and to exert neuroprotective effects in the CNS following different types of injuries. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these effects occur remain unclear. In recent years, several research groups including ours have attempted to explain the potential mechanisms and signaling pathways for the repressive effect of various drugs, on activation of microglial cells in CNS injury. We provide here a comprehensive review of recent findings of mechanisms and signaling pathways by which microglial cells are activated in CNS inflammatory diseases. This review article further summarizes the role of microglial cells in neurodegenerative diseases and various forms of potential therapeutic options to inhibit the microglial activation which amplifies the inflammation-related neuronal injury in neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Not all people diagnosed as having MCI, however, will develop AD, hence there is a need to reliably predict progression. To this aim, different biomarkers have been proposed with the attempt to identify MCI people who already have pre-clinical AD. Neuropsychological assessment, peripheral and CSF biomarkers as well as neuroimaging findings (both structural and functional) have reported variable accuracy values, but better results have been obtained by combined biomarker approach.

These functions mainly result from its interaction with Glu receptors (GluRs). The broad spectrum of roles played by glutamate derived from the large number of membrane receptors, which are currently classified in two main categories, ionotropic (iGluRs) and metabotropic (mGluRs) receptors. The iGluRs are ion channels, permeant to Na(+) (Ca(2+)) while the mGluRs belongs to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Despite continuous efforts over more than two decades, the use of iGluR agonists or antagonists to improve or inhibit excitatory transmission in pathological states still remains a major challenge, though the discovery and development of recent molecules may prove it worthwhile. This probably results form the vital role of fast excitatory transmission in many fundamental physiological functions. Since the discovery of mGluRs, hope has emerged. Indeed, mGluRs are mainly involved in the regulation of fast excitatory transmission. Consequently, it was logically thought that modulating mGluRs with agonists or antagonists might lead to more subtle regulation of fast excitatory transmission than by directly blocking iGluRs. As a result of intensive investigation, new drugs permitting to discriminate between these receptors have emerged. Moreover, a new class of molecules acting as negative or positive allosteric modulators or mGluRs is now available and appears to be promising. In the following, we will review the classification of mGluRs and the functions in which mGluRs are involved. We will focus on their potential as therapeutic targets for improving numerous physiological functions and for different neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, which are related to malfunction of Glu signaling in human beings.</AbstractText>"}

If left unabated, the economic cost of caring for patients with these maladies would consume the entire gross national product of the industrialized world by the middle of this century. Until recently, the only available drugs for this condition were cholinergic treatments, which symptomatically enhance cognitive state to some degree, but they were not neuroprotective. Many potential neuroprotective drugs tested in clinical trials failed because of intolerable side effects. However, after our discovery of its clinically-tolerated mechanism of action, one putatively neuroprotective drug, memantine, was recently approved by the European Union and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of dementia. Recent phase 3 clinical trials have shown that memantine is effective in the treatment of both mild and moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease and possibly Vascular dementia (multi-infarct dementia). Here we review the molecular mechanism of memantine's action and also the basis for the drug's use in these neurological diseases, which are mediated at least in part by excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity is defined as excessive exposure to the neurotransmitter glutamate or overstimulation of its membrane receptors, leading to neuronal injury or death. Excitotoxic neuronal cell damage is mediated in part by overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, which results in excessive Ca(2+) influx through the receptor associated ion channel and subsequent free radical formation. Physiological NMDA receptor activity, however, is also essential for normal neuronal function. This means that potential neuroprotective agents that block virtually all NMDA receptor activity will very likely have unacceptable clinical side effects. For this reason many previous NMDA receptor antagonists have disappointingly failed advanced clinical trials for a number of neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast, studies in our laboratory have shown that the adamantane derivative, memantine, preferentially blocks excessive NMDA receptor activity without disrupting normal activity. Memantine does this through its action as an uncompetitive, low-affinity, open-channel blocker; it enters the receptor-associated ion channel preferentially when it is excessively open, and, most importantly, its off-rate is relatively fast so that it does not substantially accumulate in the channel to interfere with subsequent normal synaptic transmission. Clinical use has corroborated the prediction that memantine is well tolerated. Besides Alzheimer's disease, memantine is currently in trials for additional neurological disorders, including HIV-associated dementia, depression, glaucoma, and severe neuropathic pain. A series of second-generation memantine derivatives are currently in development and may prove to have even greater neuroprotective properties than memantine. These second-generation drugs take advantage of the fact that the NMDA receptor has other modulatory sites in addition to its ion channel that potentially could also be used for safe but effective clinical intervention.</AbstractText>"}

The sirtuin family members are highly conserved evolutionarily, and are predicted to have a role in cell survival. The science of sirtuins is an emerging field and is expected to contribute significantly to the role of sirtuins in healthy aging in humans. The role of sirtuins in neuronal protection has been studied in lower organisms, such as yeast, worms, flies and rodents. Both yeast Sir2 and mammalian sirtuin proteins are up-regulated under calorie-restricted and resveratrol treatments. Increased sirtuin expression protects cells from various insults. Caloric restriction and antioxidant treatments have shown useful effects in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in limited human AD clinical trials. The role sirtuins may play in modifying and protecting neurons in patients with neurodegenerative diseases is still unknown. However, a recent report of Huntington's disease revealed that Sirtuin protects neurons in a Huntington's disease mouse model, suggesting that sirtuins may protect neurons in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of sirtuins involved in neuronal protection and the potential therapeutic value of sirtuins in healthy aging and AD.</AbstractText>"}

To determine experimentally whether chronic generalized complex I inhibition has an effect on the distribution of alpha-synuclein or tau, we infused rats systemically with the plant-derived isoflavonoid rotenone. Rotenone-treated rats with a pronounced metabolic impairment had reduced locomotor activity, dystonic limb posture and postural instability. They lost neurons in the substantia nigra and in the striatum. Spherical deposits of alpha-synuclein were observed in a few cells, but cells with abnormal cytoplasmic accumulations of tau immunoreactivity were significantly more numerous in the striatum of severely lesioned rats. Abnormally high levels of tau immunoreactivity were found in the cytoplasm of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Ultrastructurally, tau-immunoreactive material consisted of straight 15-nm filaments decorated by antibodies against phosphorylated tau. Many tau+ cell bodies also stained positive for thioflavin S, nitrotyrosine and ubiquitin. Some cells with abnormal tau immunoreactivity contained activated caspase 3. Our data suggest that chronic respiratory chain dysfunction might trigger a form of neurodegeneration in which accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein predominates over deposits of alpha-synuclein.</AbstractText>"}

It is characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine in the substantia nigra and striatum. However, over 70% of dopaminergic neuronal death occurs before the first symptoms appear, which makes either early diagnosis or effective treatments extremely difficult. Only symptomatic therapies have been used, including levodopa (l-dopa), to restore dopamine content; however, the use of l-dopa leads to some long-term pro-oxidant damage. In addition to a few specific mutations, oxidative stress and generation of free radicals from both mitochondrial impairment and dopamine metabolism are considered to play critical roles in PD etiology. Thus, the use of antioxidants as an important co-treatment with traditional therapies for PD has been suggested. Melatonin, or N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine, an indole mainly produced in the pineal gland, has been shown to have potent endogenous antioxidant actions. Because neurodegenerative disorders are mainly caused by oxidative damage, melatonin has been tested successfully in both in vivo and in vitro models of PD.

This is dramatically demonstrated by the worsening of Parkinson's disease symptoms following acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Typically, in the brain, the synapse-anchored synaptic AChE (AChE-S) variant is prevalent whereas the soluble readthrough AChE (AChE-R) variant is induced in response to cholinesterase inhibition or stress. Because of the known functional differences between these variants and the fact that AChE-R expression is triggered by various stimuli that themselves are often associated with Parkinson's disease risk, we hypothesized that the splice shift to AChE-R plays a functional role in Parkinsonian progression. After establishing that Paraoxon-induced AChE inhibition indeed aggravates experimental Parkinsonism triggered by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in mice, we tested the roles of individual AChE variants by exposing transgenic mice overexpressing either the AChE-S or AChE-R variant to MPTP. Differential reductions of tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the striatum and substantia nigra indicated that transgenic AChE-R expression confers resistance as compared with the parent FVB/N strain. In contrast, AChE-S overexpression accelerated the MPTP-induced damage. Survival, behavioral measures and plasma corticosterone levels were also compatible with the extent of the dopaminergic damage. Our findings highlight the functional differences between individual AChE variants and indicate that a naturally occurring stress or AChE inhibitor-induced splicing shift can act to minimize dopaminergic cholinergic imbalances. We propose that inherited or acquired alternative splicing deficits could accelerate Parkinsonism and that, correspondingly, adaptive alternative splicing events may attenuate disease progression.</AbstractText>"}

The most prominent event in these diseases is a rapid and pronounced neuronal loss, although the cause and the precise mechanisms of neuronal cell death have not been identified so far. Recently, it has been suggested that corticosteroids might play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders in general, as the regulation of these hormones was found to be disturbed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. To evaluate the possible corticosteroid disturbances in prion diseases, we determined the concentration of corticosterone metabolites in the faeces of scrapie-inoculated mice during the course of the clinical disease. We observed markedly elevated concentrations of the metabolites during the last 5 weeks of the disease, as well as a severe disturbance of circadian periodicity of corticosterone excretion as much as 2 weeks before this elevation. A simultaneous downregulation of cerebral neuronal glucocorticoid receptors was not detectable by immunohistochemistry, indicating that increased corticosteroids can elicit their effects in mouse scrapie freely. The dysregulation of corticosteroid excretion might act as a further cofactor in the pathogenesis of scrapie, for example by preconditioning nerve cells to disease-immanent neurotoxic stimuli, such as oxidative stress, and to apoptosis.</AbstractText>"}

The murine neuroblastoma N2a cell line, infected with the 22L mouse-adapted scrapie strain, was used to screen a large library of Mabs with similar binding affinities to PrP, to identify those antibodies which could clear established infection and/or prevent infection de novo. Three Mabs were found capable of complete and persistent clearing of already-infected N2a cells of PrP(Sc). These antibodies were 6D11 (generated to PK-resistant PrP(Sc) and detecting PrP residues 93-109), and 7H6 and 7A12, which were raised against recombinant PrP and react with neighbouring epitopes of PrP residues 130-140 and 143-155, respectively. Mabs were found to interact with PrP(Sc) formation both on the cell surface and after internalization in the cytosol.

For an improved diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, new methodologies have to be developed that enable a well-defined differentiation between properly folded and inactive metalloproteins in clinical samples. In the literature it is reported that different high molecular mass metal-containing proteins were isolated in brain samples from Alzheimer's patients and in vegetables by using a 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) procedure. In the present article, selected results of these studies are scrutinized and compared with some results obtained by a standardized method termed 'quantitative preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE)'. Conclusively, QPNC-PAGE is a highly efficient approach used by biochemists to resolve native and denatured metalloproteins (MW 6 - &gt; or = 200 kDa) in complex protein mixtures.</AbstractText>"}

How repressors work is not well understood, but often involves interactions with co-repressors. We isolated mutations in the brakeless gene in a screen for maternal factors affecting segmentation of the Drosophila embryo. Brakeless, also known as Scribbler, or Master of thickveins, is a nuclear protein of unknown function. In brakeless embryos, we noted an expanded expression pattern of the Krüppel (Kr) and knirps (kni) genes. We found that Tailless-mediated repression of kni expression is impaired in brakeless mutants. Tailless and Brakeless bind each other in vitro and interact genetically. Brakeless is recruited to the Kr and kni CRMs, and represses transcription when tethered to DNA. This suggests that Brakeless is a novel co-repressor. Orphan nuclear receptors of the Tailless type also interact with Atrophin co-repressors. We show that both Drosophila and human Brakeless and Atrophin interact in vitro, and propose that they act together as a co-repressor complex in many developmental contexts. We discuss the possibility that human Brakeless homologs may influence the toxicity of polyglutamine-expanded Atrophin-1, which causes the human neurodegenerative disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA).</AbstractText>"}

Patients are plagued by early cognitive signs, motor deficits, and psychiatric disturbances. Symptoms are attributed to cell death in the striatum and disruption of cortical-striatal circuitry. Mechanisms of cell death are unclear, but processes involving mitochondrial abnormalities, excitotoxicity, and abnormal protein degradation have been implicated. Many factors likely contribute to neuron death and dysfunction, and this has made it difficult to systematically address the pathology in HD. Pharmaceutical therapies are commonly used in patients to treat disease symptoms. These have limited benefit and do not address the inexorable disease progression. Several neuroprotective therapies are being evaluated in animal models of HD as well as in clinical trials. Similarly, cell replacement strategies such as fetal transplantation have been used in the clinic with minimal success, making future cell replacement strategies such as stem cell therapy uncertain. This review describes the disease pathology in HD and addresses many of the past and emerging therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>"}

In this review, we will give a brief overview of the BBB, its components, and their functions. We will critically evaluate the current literature in AD and PD BBB pathology resulting from insult, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.

It is now appreciated that axon growth is regulated by a combination of extracellular factors related to the milieu of the developing or adult CNS and the presence of injury, and intracellular factors related to the 'growth state' of the developing or regenerating neuron. Several critical points of convergence within the developing or regenerating neuron for mediating intracellular cell signaling effects on the growth cone cytoskeleton have been identified, and their modulation has produced marked increases in axon outgrowth within the 'nonpermissive' milieu of the adult injured CNS. One such critical convergence point is the small GTPase RhoA, which integrates signaling events produced by both myelin-associated inhibitors (e.g., NogoA) and astroglial-derived inhibitors (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) and regulates the activity of downstream effectors that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics within the growth cone mediating axon outgrowth or retraction. Inhibition of RhoA has been associated with increased outgrowth on nonpermissive substrates in vitro and increased axon regeneration in vivo. We are developing lentiviral vectors that modulate RhoA activity, allowing more long-term expression than is possible with current approaches. These vectors may be useful in regenerative strategies for spinal cord injury, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.</AbstractText>"}

In most vertebrates, including humans, melatonin is synthesized primarily in the pineal gland and is regulated by the environmental light/dark cycle via the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Pinealocytes function as 'neuroendocrine transducers' to secrete melatonin during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle and, consequently, melatonin is often called the 'hormone of darkness'. Melatonin is principally secreted at night and is centrally involved in sleep regulation, as well as in a number of other cyclical bodily activities. Melatonin is exclusively involved in signaling the 'time of day' and 'time of year' (hence considered to help both clock and calendar functions) to all tissues and is thus considered to be the body's chronological pacemaker or 'Zeitgeber'. Synthesis of melatonin also occurs in other areas of the body, including the retina, the gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone marrow and in lymphocytes, from which it may influence other physiological functions through paracrine signaling. Melatonin has also been extracted from the seeds and leaves of a number of plants and its concentration in some of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than its night-time plasma value in humans. Melatonin participates in diverse physiological functions. In addition to its timekeeping functions, melatonin is an effective antioxidant which scavenges free radicals and up-regulates several antioxidant enzymes. It also has a strong antiapoptotic signaling function, an effect which it exerts even during ischemia. Melatonin's cytoprotective properties have practical implications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Melatonin also has immune-enhancing and oncostatic properties. Its 'chronobiotic' properties have been shown to have value in treating various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as jet lag or shift-work sleep disorder. Melatonin acting as an 'internal sleep facilitator' promotes sleep, and melatonin's sleep-facilitating properties have been found to be useful for treating insomnia symptoms in elderly and depressive patients. A recently introduced melatonin analog, agomelatine, is also efficient for the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar affective disorder. Melatonin's role as a 'photoperiodic molecule' in seasonal reproduction has been established in photoperiodic species, although its regulatory influence in humans remains under investigation. Taken together, this evidence implicates melatonin in a broad range of effects with a significant regulatory influence over many of the body's physiological functions.</AbstractText>"}

To identify compounds that modulate the response to heat shock, we analyzed several natural products using a mammalian cell line containing an hsp promoterregulated reporter gene. In this study, we found that an extract from Fructus Arctii markedly suppressed the expression of Hsp induced by heat shock. A component of the extract arctigenin, but not the component arctiin, suppressed the response at the level of the activation of heat shock transcription factor, the induction of mRNA, and the synthesis and accumulation of Hsp. Furthermore, arctigenin inhibited the acquisition of thermotolerance in mammalian cells, including cancer cells. Thus, arctigenin seemed to be a new suppressive regulator of heat shock response in mammalian cells, and may be useful for hyperthermia cancer therapy.</AbstractText>"}

Using cocultures of rat cortical neurons and microglia, we show that ATP and the more potent P2X(7) agonist benzoylbenzoyl-ATP (BzATP) cause neuronal cell injury. The deleterious effects of BzATP-treated microglia were prevented by nonselective P2X antagonists (PPADS and oxidized ATP) and by the more selective P2X(7) antagonist Brilliant Blue G. Similar concentrations of BzATP caused release of superoxide and nitric oxide from isolated microglia, and neuronal cell injury was attenuated by a superoxide dismutase mimetic and by a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, suggesting a role for reactive oxide species. Cocultures composed of wild-type cortical neurons, and microglia from P2X(7) receptor-deficient mice failed to exhibit neuronal cell injury in the presence of BzATP, but retained sensitivity to injury when microglia were derived from genotypically matched normal (P2X(7) (+/+) mice), thereby establishing P2X(7) involvement in the injury process. P2X(7) receptor activation on microglia thus appears necessary for microglial-mediated injury of neurons, and proposes that targeting P2X(7) receptors may constitute a novel approach for the treatment of acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders where a microglial component is evident.</AbstractText>"}

Several of the diseases are associated with parkinsonian syndromes, induced by degeneration of basal ganglia regions that contain the highest amount of iron within the brain. The group of neurodegenerative disorders associated with parkinsonian syndromes with increased brain iron content can be devided into two groups: (1) parkinsonian syndromes associated with brain iron accumulation, including Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, parkinsonian type of multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, and Westphal variant of Huntington's disease; and (2) monogenetically caused disturbances of brain iron metabolism associated with parkinsonian syndromes, including aceruloplasminemia, hereditary ferritinopathies affecting the basal ganglia, and panthotenate kinase associated neurodegeneration type 2. Although it is still a matter of debate whether iron accumulation is a primary cause or secondary event in the first group, there is no doubt that iron-induced oxidative stress contributes to neurodegeneration. Parallels concerning pathophysiological as well as clinical aspects can be drawn between disorders of both groups. Results from animal models and reduction of iron overload combined with at least partial relief of symptoms by application of iron chelators in patients of the second group give hope that targeting the iron overload might be one possibility to slow down the neurodegenerative cascade also in the first group of inevitably progressive neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2006 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Currently, a molecular understanding for this behavior is lacking. In the present study, we have investigated the hydrogen/deuterium exchange of Abeta-(1-42) fibrils under physiological conditions, using solution NMR spectroscopy. The obtained residue-specific and quantitative map of the solvent protection within the Abeta-(1-42) fibril shows that there are two protected core regions, Glu11-Gly25 and Lys28-Ala42, and that the residues in between, Ser26 and Asn27, as well as those in the N terminus, Asp1-Tyr10, are solvent-accessible. This result reveals considerable discrepancies when compared with a previous investigation on Abeta-(1-40) fibrils and suggests that the additional residues in Abeta-(1-42), Ile41 and Ala42, significantly increase the solvent protection and stability of the C-terminal region Lys28-Ala42.

Structures are dynamic and contain areas of heterogeneity which are vital for their formation. In this review, we discuss some of the ways in which these dynamic and heterogeneous structures have implications during stress and in relation to certain human diseases. A particular stress is that of temperature which may instigate adaptation in poikilotherms or appropriate defensive responses during fever in mammals. Recent data emphasise the role of membranes in sensing temperature changes and in controlling a regulatory loop with chaperone proteins. This loop seems to need the existence of specific membrane microdomains and also includes association of chaperone (heat stress) proteins with the membrane. The role of microdomains is then discussed further in relation to various human pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The concept of modifying membrane lipids (lipid therapy) as a means for treating such pathologies is then introduced. Examples are given when such methods have been shown to have benefit. In order to study membrane microheterogeneity in detail and to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms that account for alteration in membrane function, new methods are needed. In the second part of the review, we discuss ultra-sensitive and ultra-resolution imaging techniques. These include atomic force microscopy, single particle tracking, single particle tracing and various modern fluorescence methods. Finally, we deal with computing simulation of membrane systems. Such methods include coarse-grain techniques and Monte Carlo which offer further advances into molecular dynamics.

The present paper reviews application of transcranial brain sonography (TCS) in MS patients and TCS findings related to neuropsychological dysfunction. TCS is a new neuroimaging method displaying tissue echogenicity of the brain through the intact skull. Whereas the cortex can not be discriminated from the subcortical white matter with TCS, subcortical brain structures such as ventricles and basal ganglia can be adequately displayed. Even though TCS proved sensitive and reliable in measuring widths of third and lateral ventricles in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, relatively few TCS studies on MS patients have been reported. Data of these studies suggest a good correlation of cognitive dysfunction and width of third ventricle which can be measured reliably with TCS. Moreover, abnormal TCS findings of basal ganglia were associated with cognitive impairment. However, TCS findings of midbrain structures, basal ganglia and ventricles did not correlate with fatigue or depression in MS patients. TCS has the advantages of low costs, short investigation times and unlimited repeatability. The use of third-ventricle and basalganglia TCS for predicting and monitoring neuropsychological impairment in MS patients, however, needs to be elucidated in further studies.</AbstractText>"}

Deficiencies in energy supply, free radical generation, Ca(2+) buffering or control of apoptosis, could all theoretically contribute to progressive decline of the central nervous system. Parkinson disease illustrates how mutations in very different genes finally impinge directly or indirectly on mitochondrial function, causing subtle but finally fatal dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons. Neurons in general appear more sensitive than other cells to mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Particularly interesting are mutations in genes such as Opa1, Mfn1 and Dnm1l, whose products are involved in the dynamic morphological alterations and subcellular trafficking of mitochondria. These indicate that mitochondrial dynamics are especially important for the long-term maintenance of the nervous system. The emerging evidence clearly demonstrates the crucial role of specific mitochondrial functions in maintaining neuronal circuit integrity.</AbstractText>"}

Most AD and PD cases occur sporadically and it is generally agreed that they could arise through interactions among genetic and environmental factors. Candidate genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, neurodegeneration and functioning of dopaminergic neurons were found to be associated with PD. Some of these genes interact with environmental factors that could modify PD risk. Thus, we found that the inverse association between smoking and the risk of PD depended on a polymorphism of the iNOS (inducible NO synthase) gene. We also found that the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene could have a modifying effect on the risk of PD among persons exposed to pesticides. Both interactions have biological plausibility supported by laboratory studies and could contribute to better understand the aetiology of PD. A single susceptibility gene has been identified in sporadic AD. The epsilon4 allele of epsilon polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is strongly associated with AD, the risk of AD being multiplied by 5 in persons carrying two epsilon4 alleles. The mechanism of the association between APOE and AD is poorly understood. A few interactions between the epsilon polymorphism and possible risk factors for AD have been described. However, these interactions had no biological plausibility and were likely due to chance.</AbstractText>"}

No definite etiology has been established for AD to date. Amyloid beta (Abeta) protein plays a central role in the pathology of AD through multiple pathways like oxidative stress, apoptosis etc. Recently, our laboratory first time has evidenced localization of Abeta immunoreactivity in apoptotic nuclei of degenerating AD brain hippocampal neurons and also showed that Abeta (1-42) binds and alters the helicity of DNA. The present study provided fundamental data on DNA nicking induced by Abeta. The results showed that Abeta (1-42) has DNA nicking activity similar to nucleases. Further, magnesium ion (1mM) enhanced DNA nicking activity of Abeta. The data on Abeta solution stability on DNA nicking revealed that the oligomers of Abeta (1-42) peptides showed more DNA nicking activity compared to monomers and fibrillar forms. The nuclease specific inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid prevented the DNA nicking property of Abeta. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed that Abeta causes open circular and linear forms in supercoiled DNA and also clearly evidenced the physical association of protein-DNA complex. The above data indicated that Abeta mimics endonuclease behavior. Our finding of DNA nicking activity of Abeta peptides has biological significance in terms of causing direct DNA damage.</AbstractText>"}

In such studies, patients' mental and physical conditions are measured over their follow-up periods and the resulting data are often complicated by subject-specific measurement times and possible terminal events associated with outcome variables. Motivated by the 'Predictor's Cohort' study on patients with advanced Alzheimer disease, we propose in this paper a semiparametric modeling approach to longitudinal health-related quality of life data. It builds upon and extends some recent developments for longitudinal data with irregular observation times. The new approach handles possibly dependent terminal events. It allows one to examine time-dependent covariate effects on the evolution of outcome variable and to assess nonparametrically change of outcome measurement that is due to factors not incorporated in the covariates. The usual large-sample properties for parameter estimation are established. In particular, it is shown that relevant parameter estimators are asymptotically normal and the asymptotic variances can be estimated consistently by the simple plug-in method. A general procedure for testing a specific parametric form in the nonparametric component is also developed. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach performs well for practical settings. The method is applied to the motivating example.</AbstractText>"}

Yet, several independent lines of experimental evidence strongly suggested that intracellular proteolysis is largely non-lysosomal, but the mechanisms involved remained obscure. The discovery of the ubiquitinproteasome system resolved the enigma. We now recognize that degradation of intracellular proteins is involved in regulation of a broad array of cellular processes, such as cell cycle and division, regulation of transcription factors, and assurance of the cellular quality control.

Administration of the C5a antagonists (10 mg/kg/day, oral) either 48 h pre- or 48 h post-toxin significantly reduced body weight loss, anorexia, and behavioral and motor deficits associated with 3-NP intoxication. Striatal lesion size, apoptosis, neutrophil infiltration, and hemorrhage were also significantly reduced in C5a antagonist-treated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated marked deposition of C3 and C9, and up-regulation of C5a receptors on neuronal cells at the time of lesion formation. Inhibition of prostaglandins or TNF-alpha with ibuprofen or infliximab had no effect in this model. The C5a antagonists did not affect 3-NP-induced cell death when added directly to rat striatal neuronal cultures, indicating a secondary mechanism of action in vivo.

How proteins within these inclusion bodies escape proteasomal degradation despite being enriched with ubiquitin remains a conundrum. Current evidence suggests a relationship between proteasomal impairment and inclusion formation, a persuasive explanation for the inability of the cell to remove ubiquitinated protein aggregates. Alternatively, the formation of ubiquitin-enriched inclusion may be uncoupled from the proteasome. Supporting this, we recently uncovered a novel, proteasomal-independent, catalytic activity for the Parkinson disease (PD)-linked ubiquitin ligase, parkin, that significantly enhances the formation of Lewy body (LB)-like inclusions generated in cultured cells by the co-expression of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1. This unique activity of parkin mediates a non-classical, lysine (K) 63-linked ubiquitin multichain assembly on synphilin-1 that is distinct from the classical, degradation-associated, K48-linked ubiquitination. Interestingly, two other PD-linked gene products, alpha-synuclein and UCHL1, have recently also been associated with K63-linked ubiquitination. Inclusive of parkin, there are therefore now three PD-related gene products that are known to potentiate K63-linked ubiquitination, thus signalling an important functional relationship between this unique mode of ubiquitin tagging and PD pathogenesis. Mechanistically, the involvement of a 'non-degradative' mode of ubiquitination in protein inclusion formation is an attractive explanation for how proteins are seemingly stabilized within inclusions.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, a role for QA in the pathophysiology of glutaric acidemia type I (GAI) was postulated. Considering that oxidative stress has been recently involved in the pathophysiology of the brain injury in these neurodegenerative disorders; in the present study, we investigated the in vitro effect of QA on various parameters of oxidative stress, namely total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP), total antioxidant reactivity (TAR), glutathione (GSH) levels, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) measurement and chemiluminescence in cerebral cortex of 30-day-old rats. QA diminished the brain non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses, as determined by the reduced levels of TRAP, TAR and GSH. We also observed that QA significantly increased TBA-RS and chemiluminescence. Therefore, in vitro QA-treatment of rat cortical supernatants induced oxidative stress by reducing the tissue antioxidant defenses and increasing lipid oxidative damage, probably as a result of free radical generation. In addition, we examined the effect of QA on TBA-RS levels in the presence of glutaric acid (GA) and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3HGA), which are accumulated in GAI, as well as in the presence of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK), a tryptophan metabolite of the kynurenine pathway with antioxidant properties. It was verified that the single addition of QA or GA plus 3HGA to the incubation medium significantly stimulated in vitro lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, 3HK completely prevented the TBA-RS increase caused by the simultaneous addition of QA, GA and 3HGA. Taken together, it may be presumed that QA induces oxidative stress in the brain, which may be associated, at least in part, with the pathophysiology of central nervous system abnormalities of neurodegenerative diseases in which QA accumulates.</AbstractText>"}

These pathological cholinesterases, with altered properties, are suggested to participate in formation of plaques. The present experiment assessed the ability of rivastigmine, a clinically utilized agent that inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities, to inhibit cholinesterases in plaques and tangles. Cortical sections from cases of Alzheimer's disease were processed using cholinesterase histochemistry in the presence or absence of rivastigmine. Optical densities of stained sections were utilized as a measure of inhibition. The potency of rivastigmine was compared with those of other specific inhibitors. Optimum staining for cholinesterases in neurons and axons was obtained at pH 8.0. Cholinesterases in plaques, tangles and glia were stained best at pH 6.8. Butyrylcholinesterase-positive plaques were more numerous than acetylcholinesterase-positive plaques. Rivastigmine inhibited acetylcholinesterase in all positive structures in a dose-dependent manner (10(-6)-10(-4) M). However, even at the highest concentration, faint activity remained. In contrast, rivastigmine resulted in complete inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase in all structures at 10(-5) M. Rivastigmine was equipotent to the specific acetylcholinesterase inhibitor BW284C51 and more potent than the butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors iso-OMPA and ethopropazine. In conclusion, rivastigmine is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and a more potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase in plaques and tangles. Unlike other cholinesterase inhibitors tested, rivastigmine inhibited cholinesterases in normal and pathological structures with the same potency. Thus, at the therapeutic concentrations used, rivastigmine is likely to result in inhibition of pathological cholinesterases, with the potential of interfering with the disease process.</AbstractText>"}

Neuronal toxicity in HD is thought to be, at least in part, a consequence of protein interactions involving mutant Htt. We therefore hypothesized that genetic modifiers of HD neurodegeneration should be enriched among Htt protein interactors. To test this idea, we identified a comprehensive set of Htt interactors using two complementary approaches: high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity pull down followed by mass spectrometry. This effort led to the identification of 234 high-confidence Htt-associated proteins, 104 of which were found with the yeast method and 130 with the pull downs. We then tested an arbitrary set of 60 genes encoding interacting proteins for their ability to behave as genetic modifiers of neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of HD. This high-content validation assay showed that 27 of 60 orthologs tested were high-confidence genetic modifiers, as modification was observed with more than one allele. The 45% hit rate for genetic modifiers seen among the interactors is an order of magnitude higher than the 1%-4% typically observed in unbiased genetic screens. Genetic modifiers were similarly represented among proteins discovered using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down/mass spectrometry methods, supporting the notion that these complementary technologies are equally useful in identifying biologically relevant proteins. Interacting proteins confirmed as modifiers of the neurodegeneration phenotype represent a diverse array of biological functions, including synaptic transmission, cytoskeletal organization, signal transduction, and transcription. Among the modifiers were 17 loss-of-function suppressors of neurodegeneration, which can be considered potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Finally, we show that seven interacting proteins from among 11 tested were able to co-immunoprecipitate with full-length Htt from mouse brain. These studies demonstrate that high-throughput screening for protein interactions combined with genetic validation in a model organism is a powerful approach for identifying novel candidate modifiers of polyglutamine toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

In particular, one of its functions is of importance for synaptic plasticity. Extracellular amyloid beta may suppress synaptic plasticity or inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) from outside the cell. LTP is now considered the molecular basis of memory. Amyloid beta may induce the inhibition or loss of memory. We propose that suppression of LTP by amyloid beta induces a kind of physiological forgetfulness. On the other hand, homocysteic acid (HA) which is released from astrocytes under stress conditions accumulates the amyloid beta into neuronal cell, which consequently induces the inhibition of amyloid beta physiological function and induces strong LTP. We propose that HA induces strong unforgetful memory under stress condition such as PTSD and emotional depression. The situation is different in the elderly people. Prolonged stress in the elderly people may induce neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. We observed that in the presence of excess methionine, HA induced alpha-synuclein protein in cultured cells, suggesting a hypermethylation model in vivo. Usually hypermethylation is observed in the ageing process. We have shown that HA promotes the accumulation of amyloid beta in cells, and that the production of alpha-synuclein, which induces the aggregation of amyloid beta, impairing the cell function. LTP is inhibited by deficient cellular function, which means that memories cannot be formed. In fact, there is confusion of memories in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, the aggregated alpha-synuclein induces tau pathology, which induces cell death, leading to Alzheimer's pathology. In conclusion, we propose that HA induces Alzheimer's pathology in the elderly people because of prolonged stress.</AbstractText>"}

Spastin encodes a microtubule (MT)-severing AAA ATPase (ATPase associated with various activities), and atlastin encodes a Golgi-localized integral membrane protein GTPase. Atlastin does not regulate the enzymatic activity of spastin. We also identified a clinical mutation in atlastin outside of the GTPase domain that prevents interaction with spastin in cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that failure of appropriate interaction between these two HSP gene products may be pathogenetically relevant.

Recent research suggests that the pathophysiology underlying RBD may involve a dopaminergic deficiency, given its association with Parkinson syndromes and restless legs syndrome (RLS). We report on the efficacy of pramipexole, a dopaminergic D2-3 receptor agonist, in the treatment of RBD.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='PATIENTS AND METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>The first 10 consecutive patients presenting with a history and polysomnographically confirmed RBD were given pramipexole as either a single dose before bedtime or as a divided dose regimen with the first dose given in the early evening and the second dose at bedtime.

A divided dose regimen of pramipexole was used in 56% of patients remaining on pramipexole. We found that 89% of patients experienced either a moderate reduction or complete resolution in the frequency of RBD symptoms throughout the duration of the study. Moreover, 67% reported at least a moderate reduction in the severity of remaining symptoms.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Pramipexole markedly reduced the frequency and severity of RBD symptoms and appeared to maintain efficacy for up to 25 months as assessed at follow-up visits. Clonazepam may have numerous unwanted side effects in the elderly or narcoleptics with RBD, such as prominent sedation and the potential exacerbation of underlying obstructive breathing in sleep. The potential role of pramipexole in improving RBD and its associated dopamine deficient syndromes warrants further research in the use of dopaminergic agonists as a potential first-line alternative therapy for RBD.</AbstractText>"}

The formation of nitric oxide (NO), by astrocytes, has been suggested to contribute to the neurodegnerative process. Some studies have described the participation of different isoforms of NOS in the progression of AD. The present work was conducted in order to investigate the role played by NO and peroxynitrite in platelets from AD patients, the possible correlation with Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and the intracellular Ca(2+) in the same group of patients as well as the expression of NOS isoenzymes and nitrotyrosine as markers of NO synthesis and reactive protein nitration. NO production was significantly elevated in the platelets from AD patients compared to controls as well as l-arginine/NO-dependent ONOO(-). Membrane Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was significantly decreased in patients than in controls while intracellular Ca(2+) concentration shows an opposite trend. Platelet from AD patients showed a significantly increased 1-[4-(trimethylammonio)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) fluorescence anisotropy compared with controls. Western blot analysis using anti-iNOS and eNOS monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that both isoforms were detectable in cell lysates as well as nitrotyrosine more pronounced in the cell lysates from AD patients than controls. In conclusion, the increased expression and activity of nitrergic system may produce platelet membrane alteration or vice versa. These modifications may contribute further to the neurodegenerative process in AD because the abnormal function of Alzheimer platelets play a very important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

A current hypothesis for neurodegeneration of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons in HD is an alteration in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. In the present study we examined electrophysiological properties of NMDA receptors in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model. These animals express exon 1 of the human HD gene and present an overt behavioral phenotype at about 5 weeks of age. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from acutely dissociated striatal neurons were obtained from three different age groups of transgenic mice (15, 21, and 40 days old) and their littermate controls (WT). In transgenic animals, two groups of neurons were found with respect to NMDA and Mg2+ sensitivity. One group of R6/2 cells displayed responses similar to those of WT, whereas the other showed increased responses to NMDA and decreased Mg2+ sensitivity. These cells were encountered in all age groups. The abnormal sensitivity to NMDA and Mg2+ indicates that NMDA receptor alterations occur very early in development and suggest the presence of constitutively abnormal NMDA receptors. These alterations may contribute to an enhancement of NMDA responses at hyperpolarized membrane potentials that may be a key factor in striatal neuronal dysfunction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the hypothalamus, insulin regulates food intake, body weight, peripheral fat deposition, hepatic gluconeogenesis, reproductive endocrine axis, and compensatory secretion of counter-regulatory hormones to hypoglycemia. In the hippocampus, insulin promotes learning and memory, independent of the glucoregulatory effect of insulin. Defective insulin receptor signalings are associated with the dementia in normal aging and patients with age-related neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease); the cognitive impairment can be reversed with systemic administration of insulin in the euglycemic condition. Intranasal administration of insulin enhances memory and mood and decreases body weight in healthy humans, without causing hypoglycemia. In the hypothalamus, insulin-induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway followed by opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channel has been shown to be related to multiple effects of insulin. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of insulin's pleiotropic effects still remain obscure. More importantly, much remains unknown about the quality control mechanisms ensuring correct conformational maturation of the insulin receptor, and the cellular mechanisms regulating density of cell surface functional insulin receptors.</AbstractText>"}

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degradation of most cellular proteins and plays essential roles in virtually all cellular processes. UPS impairment by aberrant protein aggregation was previously shown in cell culture but remains to be demonstrated in intact animals. Mechanisms underlying the impairment are poorly understood. We report here that UPS proteolytic function is severely impaired in the heart of a mouse model of intrasarcoplasmic amyloidosis caused by cardiac-restricted expression of a human desmin-related myopathy-linked missense mutation of alphaB-crystallin (CryAB(R120G)). The UPS impairment was detected before cardiac hypertrophy, and failure became discernible, suggesting that defective protein turnover likely contributes to cardiac remodeling and failure in this model. Further analyses reveal that the impairment is likely attributable to insufficient delivery of substrate proteins into the 20S proteasomes, and depletion of key components of the 19S subcomplex may be responsible. The derangement is likely caused by aberrant protein aggregation rather than loss of function of the CryAB gene because UPS malfunction was not evident in CryAB-null hearts and inhibition of aberrant protein aggregation by Congo red or a heat shock protein significantly attenuated CryAB(R120G)-induced UPS malfunction in cultured cardiomyocytes. Because of the central role of the UPS in cell regulation and the high intrasarcoplasmic amyloidosis prevalence in failing human hearts, our data suggest a novel pathogenic process in cardiac disorders with abnormal protein aggregation.</AbstractText>"}

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal system. alpha6-containing nAChRs (designated alpha6(*)1 nAChRs) have a relatively selective localization to the nigrostriatal pathway and a limited number of other CNS regions. In addition to a unique distribution, this subtype has a distinct pharmacology and specifically interacts with alpha-conotoxinMII, a toxin key in its identification and characterization. alpha6(*) nAChRs are also regulated in a novel manner, with a decrease in their number after nicotine treatment rather than the increase observed for alpha4(*) nAChRs. Striatal alpha6(*) receptors were functional and mediate dopamine release, suggesting that they have a presynaptic localization. This is further supported by lesion studies showing that both alpha6(*) nAChR sites and their functions are dramatically decreased with dopaminergic nerve terminal loss, in contrast to only small declines in alpha4(*) and no change in alpha7(*) receptors. Although the role of nigrostriatal alpha6(*) nAChRs is only beginning to be understood, an involvement in motor behavior is emerging. This latter observation coupled with the finding that nicotine protects against nigrostriatal damage suggest that alpha6(*) nAChRs may represent unique targets for neurodegenerative disorders linked to the nigrostriatal system such as Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

In the present paper we describe a moderately demented patient (SL) with probable AD who learned to play a song (Cossackaya!) on the violin that was published after the apparent onset of his dementia. He showed modest retention of the song at delays of 0 and 10 minutes. This contrasts with his profound disturbance in both recall and recognition on other anterograde memory tests (word lists, stories, figures, environmental sounds, sounds of musical instruments), and marked impairment on measures of remote memory (famous faces, autobiographical memory). SL showed milder deficits in confrontation naming, verbal fluency and attention, but no dyspraxia or aphasic comprehension deficits. Except for the Block Design test, his visuospatial skills were intact. SL's learning of the new song in the absence of any evidence of episodic memory is reminiscent of patients with temporal lobe amnesia who show better memory for song melody than for lyrics or verse, although his retention was not as good.</AbstractText>"}

Higher cell densities yielded more astrocytes regardless of oxygen tension. This was reversed by noggin at 5%, but not 20%, oxygen due to a novel repressive effect of low oxygen on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. When induced to differentiate by mitogen withdrawal, 5% oxygen-expanded precursors generated 17-fold more oligodendrocytes than cells expanded in 20% oxygen. When precursors were expanded at 5% oxygen and then differentiated at 20% oxygen, oligodendrocyte maturation was further enhanced 2.5-fold.

We have developed a method that specifically enriches nitrotyrosine-containing peptides so that both nitrotyrosine peptides and specific nitration sites can be unambiguously identified with LC-MS/MS. The procedure consists of the derivatization of nitrotyrosine into free sulfhydryl groups followed by high efficiency enrichment of sulfhydryl-containing peptides with thiopropyl sepharose beads. The derivatization process includes: (1) acetylation with acetic anhydride to block all primary amines, (2) reduction of nitrotyrosine to aminotyrosine, (3) derivatization of aminotyrosine with N-Succinimidyl S-Acetylthioacetate (SATA), and (4) deprotection of S-acetyl on SATA to form free sulfhydryl groups. The high specificity of this method is demonstrated by the contrasting percentage of nitrotyrosine-derivatized peptides in the identified tandem mass spectra between enriched and unenriched samples. Global analysis of unenriched in vitro nitrated human histone H1.2, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and mouse brain homogenate samples had 9%, 9%, and 5.9% of identified nitrotyrosine-containing peptides, while the enriched samples had 91% , 62%, and 35%, respectively.

This conformational characterization of extracellular protein deposits with dyes ultimately led to the identification of key players in the disease processes.

Protein synthesis includes protein transcription and translation. While many studies about protein transcription have been done in the last decade, we are just starting to understand more about the impact of protein translation. Protein translation control can be accomplished at the initiation or elongation steps. In this review, we will focus on translation control at initiation. Neurons have long neurites in which proteins have to be transported from the cell body to the end of the neurite. Since supply of proteins cannot meet the need of neuronal activity at the spine, protein locally translated at the spine will be a good solution to replace the turnover of proteins. Therefore, local protein translation is an important mechanism to maintain normal neuronal functions. In this notion, we have to separate the concept of global and local protein translation control. Both global and local protein translation control modulate normal neuronal functions from development to cognitive functions. Increasing lines of evidence show that they also play significant roles in neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. neuronal apoptosis, synaptic degeneration and autophagy. We summarize all the evidence in this review and focus on the control at initiation. The new live-cell imaging technology together with photoconvertible fluorescent probes allows us to investigate newly translated proteins in situ.

Besides inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated currents, memantine (30 and 100 microM) increased the spontaneous firing rate of whole-cell recorded dopamine neurons in a midbrain slice preparation. Occasionally, a bursting activity was observed. These effects were independent from the block of NMDA receptors and were prevented in neurons dialyzed with a high concentration of ATP (10 mM). An increase in firing rate was also induced by the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel antagonist tolbutamide (300 microM), and this increase occluded further effects of memantine. In addition, K(ATP) channel-mediated outward currents, induced by hypoxia, were inhibited by memantine (30 and 100 microM) in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist (5S, 10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) (10 microM).

Although the biochemical mechanism through which PQ causes neurodegeneration in PD is not yet fully understood, PQ-induced lipid peroxidation and consequent cell death of dopaminergic neurons can be responsible for the onset of the Parkinsonian syndrome, thus indicating that this herbicide may induce PD or influence its natural course. PQ has also been recently considered as an eligible candidate for inducing the Parkinsonian syndrome in laboratory animals, and can therefore constitute an alternative tool in suitable animal models for the study of PD. In the present review, the recent evidences linking PQ exposure with PD development are discussed, with the aim of encouraging new perspectives and further investigation on the involvement of environmental agents in PD.</AbstractText>"}

These molecular mediators belong to target classes such as ion channels, neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes and other proteins. In some cases, substantial pre-clinical validation exists, but the molecular target has not been readily druggable with small molecules, proteins or antibodies. RNA interference represents a therapeutic approach applicable to such non-druggable targets. Both non-viral and viral delivery strategies are being undertaken for in vivo silencing of molecular targets by RNA interference, which has resulted in robust efficacy in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, ALS, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, anxiety, depression, neuropathic pain, encephalitis and glioblastoma. These proof-of-concept data in animal models, together with the commencement of clinical trials using RNA interference for macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus infection, point to the potential of direct RNA interference for neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Progress in treatment of such disorders requires researchers to better understand the functions of proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, to characterize their role in pathogenic disease mechanisms, and to explore their roles in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. A variety of conditions of neurodegenerative diseases often lead to post-translational modifications of proteins, including oxidation and nitration, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Redox proteomics, a subset of proteomics, has made possible the identification of specifically oxidized proteins in neurodegenerative disorders, providing insight into a multitude of pathways that govern behavior and cognition and the response of the nervous system to injury and disease. Proteomic analyses are particularly suitable to elucidate post-translational modifications, expression levels, and protein-protein interactions of thousands of proteins at a time. Complementing the valuable information generated through the integrative knowledge of protein expression and function should enable the development of more efficient diagnostic tools and therapeutic modalities.

Brain inflammation in animal models of these diseases is dominated by chronic microglial activation with minimal proinflammatory cytokine expression. However, these inflammatory cells are 'primed' to produce exaggerated inflammatory responses to subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. We show that, using the ME7 model of prion disease, intracerebral challenge with LPS results in dramatic interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression, neutrophil infiltration, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the brain parenchyma of prion-diseased mice compared with the same challenge in normal mice. Systemic inflammation evoked by LPS also produced greater increases in proinflammatory cytokines, pentraxin 3, and inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription in prion-diseased mice than in control mice and induced microglial expression of IL-1beta. These systemic challenges also increased neuronal apoptosis in the brains of ME7 animals. Thus, both central and peripheral inflammation can exacerbate local brain inflammation and neuronal death. The finding that a single acute systemic inflammatory event can induce neuronal death in the CNS has implications for therapy in neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

To test the hypothesis, we determined how the ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) handled Ca(2+) in rat ventricular myocytes preconditioned with a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, U50488H (UP), followed by blockade of HSP70 with a selective antisense oligonucleotide and subsequently subjected to simulated ischemia. We determined the following: 1) the Ca(2+) transients induced by electrical stimulation and caffeine, which provide the overall picture of Ca(2+) homeostasis; 2) expression of RyR, SERCA, and NCX; and 3) Ca(2+) fluxes via NCX by the use of (45)Ca(2+) in the rat ventricular myocyte. We found that UP increased the activity of RyR, SERCA, and NCX and the expression of RyR and SERCA. These effects led to increases in the release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via RyR and in the removal of Ca(2+) from the cytoplasm by reuptake of Ca(2+) to the SR via SERCA and by extrusion of Ca(2+) out of the cell via NCX. UP also reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation. All of the effects of UP were either abolished or significantly attenuated by blockade of HSP70 synthesis with a selective antisense oligonucleotide. The results are evidence that activation of HSP70 by preconditioning improves the ischemia-impaired Ca(2+) homeostasis at multiple sites in the heart, which may be responsible, at least partly, for attenuated Ca(2+) overload, improved recovery in contractile function, and cardioprotection.</AbstractText>"}

Our work aims to eliminate PrP(c) as substrate for the conversion into PrP(Sc) and to increase the cellular clearance capacity of PrP(Sc). In order to achieve the first objective, we used chemical compounds which interfere with the subcellular trafficking of PrP(c), e.g. by intracellular re-routing. Recently, we found that PrP(c) requires cholesterol for cell surface localisation. Treatment with mevinolin significantly reduced the amount of cell surface PrP(c) and led to its accumulation in the Golgi compartment. These data show that cholesterol is essential for the cell surface localisation of PrP(c), which is in turn known to be necessary for the formation of PrP(Sc). Another anti-prion strategy uses RNA and peptide aptamers directed against PrP(c). We have selected peptide aptamers using a constrained peptide library presented on the active site loop of the Escherichia coli protein TrxA in a Y2H screen. Several peptides reproducibly binding to PrP(c) in several assays were identified. Preliminary data indicate that selected peptide aptamers are able to interfere with prion propagation in prion-infected cells. To obtain additive effects we have tried to clarify cellular mechanisms that enable cells to clear prion infectivity. This goal was achieved by selective interference in intracellular signalling pathways which apparently also increase the cellular autophagy machinery. Finally, we have tried to establish an active auto-vaccination approach directed against PrP, which gave some positive preliminary results in the mouse system. This might open the door to classical immunological interference techniques.</AbstractText>"}

To accomplish this goal, we induced MOG-EAE in thy1-yellow fluorescent (thy-YFP)-transgenic mice in which all spinal motorneurons express the YFP reporter protein. We demonstrate that a build-up of YFP fluorescence occurs in profiles reminiscent of tortuous fragmented axons and axonal spheroids/globules as seen in various neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases. Approximately two-thirds of these damaged axons were decorated by the monoclonal antibody SMI 32, which recognizes hypophosphorylated neurofilament-H (hypoP-NF-H), an established marker of CNS axonal pathology. Unexpectedly, one third of damaged axons were hypoP-NF-H negative but could be visualized by their expression of the YFP transgene, whilst the remaining profiles were hypoP-NF-H positive but did not exhibit YFP fluorescence. Thus, using YFP transgenic mice in conjunction with hypoP-NF-H immunoreactivity provides a more comprehensive depiction of axonopathy in the ventral-lateral aspect of lumbosacral spinal cord in MOG-EAE. When YFP fluorescence was used in conjunction with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD11b; a marker of subsets of inflammatory cells, we were able to discern evidence of an early inflammatory attack on white matter axons.

Chaperones (heat shock proteins) are key 'networkers', which sequester and repair damaged proteins. In order to link the network approach and chaperones with the aging process, we first summarize the properties of aging networks suggesting a 'weak link theory of aging'. This theory suggests that age-related random damage primarily affects the overwhelming majority of the low affinity, transient interactions (weak links) in cellular networks leading to increased noise, destabilization and diversity. These processes may be further amplified by age-specific network remodelling and by the sequestration of weakly linked cellular proteins to protein aggregates of aging cells. Chaperones are weakly linked hubs (i.e., network elements with a large number of connections) and inter-modular bridge elements of protein-protein interaction, signalling and mitochondrial networks. As aging proceeds, the increased overload of damaged proteins is an especially important element contributing to cellular disintegration and destabilization. Additionally, chaperone overload may contribute to the increase of 'noise' in aging cells, which leads to an increased stochastic resonance resulting in a deficient discrimination between signals and noise. Chaperone- and other multi-target therapies, which restore the missing weak links in aging cellular networks, may emerge as important anti-aging interventions.</AbstractText>"}

Disruption of CREB activity in the mitochondria decreases the expression of a subset of mitochondrial genes, including the ND5 subunit of complex I, down-regulates complex I-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and increases susceptibility to 3-nitropropionic acid, a mitochondrial toxin that induces a clinical and pathological phenotype similar to Huntington disease. These results demonstrate that regulation of mitochondrial gene expression by mitochondrial CREB, in part, underlies the protective effects of CREB and raise the possibility that decreased mitochondrial CREB activity contributes to the mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss associated with neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Lysosomal degradation of proteinaceous and other material declines early in such diseases. This suggests that intraneuronal aggregates consist of material which is normally broken down in the lysosome and thus accumulates when lysosomal degradation fails. This is plausible even though those aggregates are generally non-lysosomal, because lysosomal uptake may be affected. Thus, restoring lysosomal function might eliminate them--and without increasing the concentration of the soluble monomers or oligomers of which they are formed. This approach is therefore unlikely to be harmful and may well be beneficial. How might lysosomes be rejuvenated? Since lysosomal dysfunction is likely to be caused by intralysosomal material that is resistant to lysosomal degradation, normal function might be recovered by augmenting that function to cause the toxin to be degraded. Here, I describe how such augmentation might be achieved with microbial enzymes. Soil microbes display astonishing catabolic diversity, something exploited for decades in the bioremediation industry. Environments enriched in human remains impose selective pressure on the microbial population to evolve the ability to degrade any recalcitrant, energy-rich human material. Thus, microbes may exist that can degrade these lysosomal toxins. If so, it should be possible to isolate the genes responsible and modify them for therapeutic activity in the mammalian lysosome.</AbstractText>"}

The cause and mechanism of neuronal death have been elusive. However, recent genetic, postmortem and experimental evidence show that protein accumulation and aggregation are prominent occurrences in both sporadic and familial PD. The relevance of these events to other cellular and biochemical changes, and to the neurodegenerative process, is being unraveled. It is increasingly evident that one or a combination of defects, including mutations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, lead to an excess production and aggregation of abnormal proteins in PD. In this respect, altered protein handling appears to be a central factor in the pathogenic process occurring in the various hereditary and sporadic forms of PD. This suggests that manipulation of proteolytic systems is a rational approach in the development of neuroprotective therapies that could modify the pathological course of PD.</AbstractText>"}

Like neurons, glial cells are vulnerable to glutamate insults. Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes express a wide variety of glutamate receptors and transporters that mediate many of the deleterious effects of glutamate. Astrocytes are responsible for most glutamate uptake in synaptic and nonsynaptic areas and consequently, are the major regulators of glutamate homeostasis. Microglia in turn may secrete cytokines, which can impair glutamate uptake and reduce the expression of glutamate transporters. Finally, oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, are very sensitive to excessive glutamate signaling, which can lead to the apoptosis or necrosis of these cells. This review aims at summarizing the mechanisms leading to glial cell death as a consequence of alterations in glutamate signaling, and their clinical relevance. A thorough understanding of these events will undoubtedly lead to better therapeutic strategies to treat CNS diseases affecting glia and in particular, those that involve damage to white matter tracts.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We have reported that protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma) acts as a primary oxidative stress sensor in the lens. PKCgamma has a Zn-finger C1B stress switch domain, residues 101-150. Mutation, H101Y, in the C1B domain of PKCgamma proteins causes a failure of the PKCgamma oxidative stress response [Lin, D., Takemoto, D.J., 2005. Oxidative activation of protein kinase Cgamma through the C1 domain. Effects on gap junctions. J. Biol. Chem. 280, 13682-13693]. Some human neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 are caused by mutations in the PKCgamma C1B domain. In the current study we have investigated the effects of these mutations on lens epithelial cell responses to oxidative stress. The results demonstrate that PKCgamma C1B mutants had lower basal enzyme activities and were not activated by H(2)O(2). Furthermore, the PKCgamma mutations caused a failure of endogenous wild type PKCgamma to be activated by H(2)O(2). These PKCgamma mutations abolished the effect of H(2)O(2) on phosphorylation of Cx43 and Cx50 by H(2)O(2) activation of PKCgamma. The cells with PKCgamma C1B mutations had more Cx43 and/or Cx50 gap junction plaques which were not decreased by H(2)O(2). Since open gap junctions could have a bystander effect this could cause apoptosis to occur. H(2)O(2) (100 microM, 3 h) activated a caspase-3 apoptotic pathway in the lens epithelial cells but was more severe in cells expressing PKCgamma mutations. The presence of 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), an inhibitor of gap junctions, decreased Cx43 and Cx50 protein levels and gap junction plaque number. This reduction in gap junctions by AGA resulted in inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that there is a dominant negative effect of PKCgamma C1B mutations on endogenous PKCgamma which results in loss of control of gap junctions. Modeled structures suggest that the severity of C1B mutation effects may be related to the extent of loss of C1B structure. Mutations in the C1B domain of PKCgamma result in increased apoptosis in lens epithelial cells. This can be prevented by a gap junction inhibitor. Thus, propagation of apoptosis from cell-to-cell in lens epithelial cells may be through open gap junctions. The control of gap junctions requires PKCgamma.</AbstractText>"}

The most likely mechanism for toxicity is through perturbation of membrane structure, leading to increased membrane permeability and eventual cell death. There have been a rather limited number of investigations of the interactions of amyloidogenic polypeptides and their aggregated states with membranes; these are briefly reviewed here. Amyloidogenic proteins discussed include A-beta from Alzheimer's disease, the prion protein, alpha-synuclein from Parkinson's disease, transthyretin (FAP, SSA amyloidosis), immunoglobulin light chains (primary (AL) amyloidosis), serum amyloid A (secondary (AA) amyloidosis), amylin or IAPP (Type 2 diabetes) and apolipoproteins. This review highlights the significant role played by fluorescence techniques in unraveling the nature of amyloid fibrils and their interactions and effects on membranes. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a valuable and versatile method for studying the complex mechanisms of protein aggregation, amyloid fibril formation and the interactions of amyloidogenic proteins with membranes. Commonly used fluorescent techniques include intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores, fluorescent probes incorporated in the membrane, steady-state and lifetime measurements of fluorescence emission, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence anisotropy and polarization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence quenching, and fluorescence microscopy.</AbstractText>"}

It is a common cause of dementia, second only to Alzheimer's disease in the population below 65 years of age. Neuroanatomical and neurobiological substrates have been identified for the three major subtypes of FTLD and these discoveries have broadened the FTLD spectrum to include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in MAPT were found to cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), a familial disorder with filamentous tau inclusions in nerve cells and glial cells. FTDP-17 can result in clinical syndromes that closely resemble progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease. More recently, mutations in three genes (VCP, CHMP2B and PGRN) have been found to cause FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative neuronal inclusions (FTLD-U). They explain a large proportion of inherited FTLD-U. It remains to be seen whether dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) constitutes a third disease category, as many of these cases are now being reclassified as FTLD-U. Recently, TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) has been identified as a key protein of the ubiquitin inclusions of FTLD-U and ALS. Thus, for familial forms of FTLD and related disorders, we now know the primary etiologies and accumulating proteins.

In the present study, we show that ubiquilin is capable of forming dimers, and that dimerization requires the central region of ubiquilin, but not its UBL or the UBA domains. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that monomeric ubiquilin is likely to be the active form that is involved in binding presenilin proteins. Our results provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying the interaction of ubiquilin with presenilins.</AbstractText>"}

However, lack of a cure does not equate with lack of treatment. Palliative therapy is dictated by good medical practice and includes anticonvulsant medication, control of endocrine dysfunction, and surgical procedures. Removal of noxious metabolites is centered on combating lactic acidosis, but extends to other metabolites. Attempts to bypass blocks in the respiratory chain by administration of electron acceptors have not been successful, but this may be amenable to genetic engineering. Administration of metabolites and cofactors is the mainstay of real-life therapy and is especially important in disorders due to primary deficiencies of specific compounds, such as carnitine or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). There is increasing interest in the administration of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) scavengers, both in primary mitochondrial diseases and in neurodegenerative diseases. Gene therapy is a challenge because of polyplasmy and heteroplasmy, but novel experimental approaches are being pursued. One important strategy is to decrease the ratio of mutant to wild-type mitochondrial genomes ('gene shifting') by different means: (1) converting mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes into normal nuclear DNA genes ('allotopic expression'); (2) importing cognate genes from other species ('xenotopic expression'); (3) correcting mtDNA mutations by importing specific restriction endonucleases; (4) selecting for respiratory function; and (5) inducing muscle regeneration. Germline therapy raises ethical problems but is being considered for prevention of maternal transmission of mtDNA mutations. Preventive therapy through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis is becoming increasingly important for nuclear DNA-related disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Adenosine receptors (ARs) are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Their discovery opened up new avenues for potential drug treatment of a variety of conditions such as asthma, neurodegenerative disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases, and many other physiopathological states that are believed to be associated with changes in adenosine levels. Knowledge of the 3D structure of ARs could be of great help in the task of understanding their function and in the rational design of specific ligands. However, since GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins, high-resolution structural characterization is still an extremely difficult task. For this reason, great importance has been placed on molecular modeling studies and, particularly in the last few years, on homology modeling (HM) techniques. The publication of the first high-resolution crystal structure for bovine rhodopsin (bRh), a GPCR superfamily member, provides the option of utilizing HM to generate 3D models based on detailed structural information. In this review we report, analyze, and compare the main experimental data, computational HM procedures and validation methods used for ARs, describing in detail the most successful results.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Male adult Wistar rats were administered by intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 200 or 400 mg/kg HD, five days per week for 8 weeks. Samples of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, spinal cord and sciatic nerves were collected and examined for Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 expression using Western blotting. Subchronic exposure to HD resulted in significantly increased expression of both anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Caspase-3 in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, which exhibited a dose-dependent pattern. Though little change was detected in spinal cord, our results showed that the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 was markedly enhanced in the sciatic nerves.

Using in vivo MRI, at the later stages of the preclinical period (18 weeks) the diffusion of tissue water was significantly reduced, coinciding with significant microglial activation and behavioural hyperactivity. Using in vivo MRS, we found early (12 weeks) decreases in the ratio of N-acetyl aspartate to both choline (NAA/Cho) and creatine (NAA/Cr) in the thalamus and hippocampus, which were associated with early behavioural deficits. Ex vivo MRS of brain extracts confirmed and extended these findings, showing early (8-12 weeks) decreases in both the neuronal metabolites NAA and glutamate, and the metabolic metabolites lactate and glucose. Increases in the glial metabolite myo-inositol were observed at later stages when microglial and astrocyte activation is substantial.

At 12 wk of age, protein and mRNA levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) were increased by perinatal dieldrin exposure in a dose-related manner. We then administered MPTP (2 x 10 mg/kg s.c) at 12 wk of age and observed a greater reduction of striatal dopamine in dieldrin-exposed offspring, which was associated with a greater DAT:VMAT2 ratio.

In all cases there were greater effects observed in the male offspring than the female, similar to that observed in human cases of PD.

Abeta is prone to aggregate and forms amyloid fibrils progressively both in vitro and in vivo. To understand the process of amyloidogenesis, it is pivotal to examine the initial stages of the folding process. We examined the equilibrium folding properties, assembly states, and stabilities of the early folding stages of Abeta40 and Abeta42 prior to fibril formation. We found that Abeta40 and Abeta42 have different conformations and assembly states upon refolding from their unfolded ensembles. Abeta40 is predominantly an unstable and collapsed monomeric species, whereas Abeta42 populates a stable structured trimeric or tetrameric species at concentrations above approximately 12.5 microm. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the free energies of Abeta40 monomer and Abeta42 trimer/tetramer are approximately 1.1 and approximately 15/ approximately 22 kcal/mol, respectively. The early aggregation stages of Abeta40 and Abeta42 contain different solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces that are located at the sequences flanking its protease-resistant segment. The amyloidogenic folded structure of Abeta is important for the formation of spherical beta oligomeric species. However, beta oligomers are not an obligatory intermediate in the process of fibril formation because oligomerization is inhibited at concentrations of urea that have no effect on fibril formation. The distinct initial folding properties of Abeta40 and Abeta42 may play an important role in the higher aggregation potential and pathological significance of Abeta42.</AbstractText>"}

Inflammatory responses were attenuated with administration of either MC or PY, however, the combination of both compounds was significantly more effective in reducing inflammation relative to MC or PY applied alone. Immunohistochemical analysis at 7 days post-intrastriatal QUIN injection showed extensive oxidative stress evident as lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage and reactive oxygen species formation which was partially decreased by each agent applied separately but markedly inhibited with the combination of the two compounds. In addition, combination treatments significantly reduced neuronal loss in QUIN-injected striatum compared with the agents applied separately. Furthermore, long-term combination treatment decreased striatal lesions and inflammation after QUIN injection. These results demonstrate that MC and PY confer a considerably enhanced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy when applied together and suggest this combinatorial procedure as a novel therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease which exhibit excitotoxic insults.</AbstractText>"}

We also assessed whether BMAA exposure triggers cell death in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice by examining neuronal numbers and glial response in the spinal cord and the brain.

We recently generated precise deletion alleles of the Hsp70 genes of D. melanogaster and have used those alleles to characterize the phenotypes of Hsp70-deficient flies. Flies with Hsp70 deletions have reduced thermotolerance. We find that Hsp70 is essential to survive a severe heat shock, but is not required to survive a milder heat shock, indicating that a significant degree of thermotolerance remains in the absence of Hsp70. However, flies without Hsp70 have a lengthened heat-shock response and an extended developmental delay after a non-lethal heat shock, indicating Hsp70 has an important role in recovery from stress, even at lower temperatures. Lack of Hsp70 also confers enhanced sensitivity to a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation and to the neurodegenerative effects produced by expression of a human polyglutamine disease protein.</AbstractText>"}

Energy status is monitored by the cellular AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) system, whereas leptin regulates total energy balance. We investigated the roles of AMPK and leptin in cognition and survival under diet restriction (DR). Hippocampal AMPK activity increases with energy restriction. Modest activation (DR to 60%) induces neurogenesis and improves cognition. However, DR to 40% augmented AMPK activity, reduced cognition and catecholamines, and increased neural apoptosis and mortality. Leptin signaling is preserved only in DR to 60%, countering the effects of AMPK 'overactivation' by preventing neuroapoptosis, restoring noradrenergic activity and behavioral performance, and increasing longevity. The balance between leptin and AMPK is crucial in determining neuronal fate, cognitive ability, and survival. Should these findings extend to Man, then controlled activation of AMPK may improve neurodegenerative diseases, and leptin may have a new role in treating stress-associated malnutrition.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we explore the hypothesis that E2 exerts a positive trophic effect on the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, an area heavily implicated in memory and attentional processes. Female rats were ovariectomized at 3 months of age and lesioned with the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin before receiving a subcutaneous pellet containing .25 mg of estrogen or placebo, released over 60 days. The control, non-ovariectomized group was treated identically. At the end of the treatment, the brains were histologically prepared and we used image analysis procedures to evaluate changes in the dendritic arborization of surviving cholinergic neurons. As expected, infusion of the immunotoxin induced a reduction in dendritic arborization in all subjects, but was significantly different from control values only in ovariectomized rats. When differences within animals were factored in, dendritic size in ovariectomized animals treated with E2 was undistinguishable from intact controls. By contrast, in ovariectomized animals treated with placebo, dendritic length remained significantly reduced. These results suggest that E2 can not only protect but also reverse structural neurodegenerative processes in cholinergic neurons. Our data is particularly relevant in the context of female aging and postmenopausal dementia, since preserving an intact cholinergic system may be crucial to prevent at least some of the cognitive decline that occurs in Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

After thirty passages in vitro in the presence of G418, engineered cells versus naive NSC cultures maintained their multipotentiality to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, it was found that rhNGF-NSC-derived neurons expressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and displayed an enhanced axonal growth. NSA showed an altered sphere forming frequency either in rhNGF-NSC or both group of control NSC.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='DISCUSSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Lentivirus-mediated rhNGF gene transfer into NSC was achieved using a new version of LV vectors. We obtained rhNGF-NSC-derived cell lines which released hNGF to high levels in the culture medium. The expression of neural differentiation markers, like microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) (a/b), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (NG2), was not enhanced in rhNGF-NSC compared with control cells. Secreted hNGF increased axonal sprouting by rhNGF-NSC-derived neurons which was associated with ChAT expression. rhNGF-NSC may prospectively be good candidates for the treatment of either neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease or central nervous system injuries.</AbstractText>"}

Hereditary mutations in the MAPT gene were shown to promote the formation of structurally distinct tau aggregates in patients that had a parkinsonian-like clinical presentation. Whether tau aggregates themselves or the soluble intermediate species that precede their aggregation are neurotoxic entities in these disorders has yet to be resolved; however, recent in vivo evidence supports the latter. We hypothesized that depletion of CHIP, a tau ubiquitin ligase, would lead to an increase in abnormal tau. Here, we show that deletion of CHIP in mice leads to the accumulation of non-aggregated, ubiquitin-negative, hyperphosphorylated tau species. CHIP-/- mice also have increased neuronal caspase-3 levels and activity, as well as caspase-cleaved tau immunoreactivity. Overexpression of mutant (P301L) human tau in CHIP-/- mice is insufficient to promote either argyrophilic or 'pre-tangle' structures, despite marked phospho-tau accumulation throughout the brain. These observations are supported in post-developmental studies using RNA interference for CHIP (chn-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans and cell culture systems. Our results demonstrate that CHIP is a primary component in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of tau. We also show that hyperphosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage of tau both occur before aggregate formation. Based on these findings, we propose that polyubiquitination of tau by CHIP may facilitate the formation of insoluble filamentous tau lesions.</AbstractText>"}

The cause of this process is mostly unknown, but evidence is available that excitotoxicity plays an important role. In this review, we will give an overview of the arguments in favor of the involvement of excitotoxicity in ALS. The most important one is that the only drug proven to slow the disease process in humans, riluzole, has anti-excitotoxic properties. Moreover, consumption of excitotoxins can give rise to selective motor neuron death, indicating that motor neurons are extremely sensitive to excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors. We will summarize the intrinsic properties of motor neurons that could render these cells particularly sensitive to excitotoxicity. Most of these characteristics relate to the way motor neurons handle Ca(2+), as they combine two exceptional characteristics: a low Ca(2+)-buffering capacity and a high number of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. These properties most likely are essential to perform their normal function, but under pathological conditions they could become responsible for the selective death of motor neurons. In order to achieve this worst-case scenario, additional factors/mechanisms could be required. In 1 to 2% of the ALS patients, mutations in the SOD1 gene could shift the balance from normal motor neuron excitation to excitotoxicity by decreasing glutamate uptake in the surrounding astrocytes and/or by interfering with mitochondrial function. We will discuss point by point these different pathogenic mechanisms that could give rise to classical and/or slow excitotoxicity leading to selective motor neuron death.</AbstractText>"}

These so-called polyalanine expansion diseases share many similarities with polyglutamine-related disorders, including a length-dependent reiteration of amino acid induction of protein aggregation and cytotoxicity. We previously reported that overexpression of ubiquilin reduces protein aggregates and toxicity of expanded polyglutamine proteins. Here, we demonstrate a similar role for ubiquilin toward expanded polyalanine proteins. Overexpression of ubiquilin-1 in HeLa cells reduced protein aggregates and the cytotoxicity associated with expression of a transfected nuclear-targeted GFP-fusion protein containing 37-alanine repeats (GFP-A37), in a dose dependent manner. Ubiquilin coimmunoprecipitated more with GFP proteins containing a 37-polyalanine tract compared to either 7 (GFP-A7), or no alanine tract (GFP). Moreover, overexpression of ubiquilin suppressed the increased vulnerability of HeLa cell lines stably expressing the GFP-A37 fusion protein to oxidative stress-induced cell death compared to cell lines expressing GFP or GFP-A7 proteins. By contrast, siRNA knockdown of ubiquilin expression in the GFP-A37 cell line was associated with decreased cellular proliferation, and increases in GFP protein aggregates, nuclear fragmentation, and cell death. Our results suggest that boosting ubiquilin levels in cells might provide a universal and attractive strategy to prevent toxicity of proteins containing reiterative expansions of amino acids involved in many human diseases.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, EAAT4 changes were examined for up to 7 days after moderate fluid-percussion by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed this increase to be localized in cells exhibiting morphological characteristics of astrocytes. In addition, increased EAAT4 immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes in the ipsilateral cortex and cerebellum at day 3 post-injury that persisted up to 7 days after the insult.

This plaque-centered view of the disease, however, fails to explain clinical deterioration of the patients when they have reached the progressive stage of the disease. It was thus postulated during the past few years that besides inflammation there is a neurodegenerative component of the disease that leads to progressive and global brain damage. This article reviews recent findings that suggest a different explanation. It describes that in the early stage of acute and relapsing multiple sclerosis, focal plaques in the white matter are formed by relapsing waves of inflammation. With chronicity, however, the inflammatory response becomes trapped behind the blood-brain barrier, giving rise to slowly progressive inflammatory damage that affects the brain and spinal cord in a global sense. This is mainly reflected by extensive cortical demyelination and diffuse axonal injury within the normal-appearing white matter. This process seems to be driven by the aberrant formation of ectopic lymphatic tissue within the brain compartment.</AbstractText>"}

It is well documented that the E2F1 transcription factor is a key regulator of apoptotic programs. E2F1-induced cell death occurs via multiple pathways, some of which involve the tumour suppressor p53, and autonomous of p53. This has led to the opinion that E2F1 functions as a tumour surveillance factor, detecting aberrant proliferation and engaging apoptotic pathways to protect the organism from developing tumours. Frequently, novel players are discovered that expand the interpretation of apoptosis control by E2F1.

Glucose reacted intensively in the Initial Phase (reaction period 0-2h) which was identified to result from a parallel mechanism involving both the direct Schiff's product formation and the auto-oxidative cleavages. In contrast, a physiological level of glyoxal revealed merely a reaction order of only 0.09, implicitly indicating a far less sensitive glycation which can be attributed to a mechanism proceeding simply through a molecular Schiff's reaction. On treatment with Psidium guajava L. aqueous extract (PE) (0.01-0.625 mg/mL), a rather unique and significant inhibitory characteristic on LDL glycation was observed with a dose-dependent manner.

Although a growing body of evidence suggests direct involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, it is still not clear whether oxidative stress is a causative early event in these conditions or a secondary phenomenon commonly found in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Using a mouse scrapie model, we assessed oxidative stress in the brain at various stages of the disease progression and observed significantly increased concentration of lipid peroxidation markers, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals, and mRNA level of an oxidative stress response enzyme, heme oxygenase-1, at early preclinical stages of scrapie. The changes preceded dramatic synaptic loss demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining of a synaptic protein, synaptophysin. These findings imply that the brain undergoes oxidative stress even from an early stage of prion invasion into the brain. Given the well-known deleterious effects of reactive-oxygen-species-mediated damage in the brain, it is considered that the oxidative stress at the preclinical stage of prion diseases may predispose the brain to neurodegenerative mechanisms that characterize the diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Because it is well established that neurotrophic factors regulate enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, we examined whether PDNF could also directly activate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine and other catecholamine neurotransmitters. We found that primary cultures of rat ventral mesencephalon responded to PDNF by increasing the number of TH-positive neurons and, most importantly, preserved expression of TH in neurons treated with Parkinson disease-inducing neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)). In dopaminergic PC12 cells, PDNF induced TH transcription via CRE element in TH promoter followed by significant increase in TH protein and expansion of TH-positive cell population. Furthermore, PDNF stimulated TH enzymatic activity by enhancing phosphorylation of seryl residues 31 and 40 through the activation of MAPK/Erk1/2 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signaling, respectively. Therefore, our results indicate that PDNF, in addition to its functioning as survival and differentiation-promoting factor for dopaminergic neuronal cells, can directly influence activity of the rate-limiting enzyme that underlies catecholamine biosynthetic cascade. This novel feature of PDNF should help understand the mechanism of neuronal function altered by T. cruzi infection, specifically neurotransmitter secretion. In addition, the findings have potential implications in the therapy of Chagas' and other neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

The corresponding hormone receptor expression was demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Cells at f60 produced significantly lower lipids than at f20. Increased mRNA and protein levels of c-Myc and increased protein levels of FN1, which have been associated with aging, were detected in SZ95 sebocytes at f60 compared to those detected at f20 after 5 days of treatment. Expression profiling employing a cDNA microarray composed of 15 529 cDNAs identified 899 genes with altered expression levels at f20 vs. f60.

Palliative therapy is dictated by good medical practice and includes anticonvulsant medication, control of endocrine dysfunction, and surgical procedures. Removal of noxious metabolites is centered on combating lactic acidosis, but extends to other metabolites. Attempts to bypass blocks in the respiratory chain by administration of electron acceptors have not been successful, but this may be amenable to genetic engineering. Administration of metabolites and cofactors is the mainstay of real-life therapy and is especially important in disorders due to primary deficiencies of specific compounds, such as carnitine or coenzyme Q10. There is increasing interest in the administration of reactive oxygen species scavengers both in primary mitochondrial diseases and in neurodegenerative diseases directly or indirectly related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Aerobic exercise and physical therapy prevent or correct deconditioning and improve exercise tolerance in patients with mitochondrial myopathies due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. Gene therapy is a challenge because of polyplasmy and heteroplasmy, but interesting experimental approaches are being pursued and include, for example, decreasing the ratio of mutant to wild-type mitochondrial genomes (gene shifting), converting mutated mtDNA genes into normal nuclear DNA genes (allotopic expression), importing cognate genes from other species, or correcting mtDNA mutations with specific restriction endonucleases. Germline therapy raises ethical problems but is being considered for prevention of maternal transmission of mtDNA mutations. Preventive therapy through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis is becoming increasingly important for nuclear DNA-related disorders.

To understand better the molecular mechanisms of TNR instability in cultured cells, a new genetic assay was created using a shuttle vector. The shuttle vector contains a promoter-TNR-reporter gene construct whose expression is dependent on TNR length. The vector harbors the SV40 ori and large T antigen gene, allowing portability between primate cell lines. The shuttle vector is propagated in cultured cells, then recovered and analyzed in yeast using selection for reporter gene expression. We show that (CAG*CTG)25-33 contracts at frequencies as high as 1% in 293T and 293 human cells and in COS-1 monkey cells, provided that the plasmid undergoes replication. Hairpin-forming capacity of the repeat sequence stimulated contractions. Evidence for a threshold was observed between 25 and 33 repeats in COS-1 cells, where contraction frequencies increased sharply (up 720%) over a narrow range of repeat lengths. Expression of the mismatch repair protein Mlh1 does not correlate with repeat instability, suggesting contractions are independent of mismatch repair in our system. Together, these findings recapitulate certain features of human genetics and therefore establish a novel cell culture system to help provide new mechanistic insights into CAG*CTG repeat instability.</AbstractText>"}

Genetic studies of autosomal dominant early onset familial AD has identified three causative genes: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2). We performed a global gene expression analysis on fibroblasts from 33 individuals (both healthy and demented mutation carriers as well as wild-type siblings) from three families segregating the APP(SWE), APP(ARC) and PSEN1 H163Y mutations, respectively. The mutations cause hereditary progressive cognitive disorder, including typical autosomal dominant AD. Our data show that the mutation carriers share a common gene expression profile significantly different from that of their wild-type siblings. The results indicate that the disease process starts several decades before the onset of cognitive decline, suggesting that presymptomatic diagnosis of AD and other progressive cognitive disorders may be feasible in the near future.</AbstractText>"}

Whether Guo also modulates the activity/expression of ion channels involved in homeostatic control of extracellular potassium by the astrocytic syncytium is still unknown. Here we provide electrophysiological evidence that chronic exposure (48 h) to Guo (500 microm) promotes the functional expression of an inward rectifier K+ (Kir) conductance in primary cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Molecular screening indicated that Guo promotes the up-regulation of the Kir4.1 channel, the major component of the Kir current in astroglia in vivo. Furthermore, the properties of astrocytic Kir current overlapped those of the recombinant Kir4.1 channel expressed in a heterologous system, strongly suggesting that the Guo-induced Kir conductance is mainly gated by Kir4.1. In contrast, the expression levels of two other Kir channel proteins were either unchanged (Kir2.1) or decreased (Kir5.1). Finally, we showed that inhibition of translational process, but not depression of transcription, prevents the Guo-induced up-regulation of Kir4.1, indicating that this nucleoside acts through de novo protein synthesis. Because accumulating data indicate that down-regulation of astroglial Kir current contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dysregulation of extracellular K+ homeostasis, these results support the notion that Guo might be a molecule of therapeutic interest for counteracting the detrimental effect of K+-buffering impairment of the astroglial syncytium that occurs in pathological conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Nonetheless, after that time, PD model neurons gradually began to undergo neuronal death over the course of 1 month, showing cytoplasmic aggregate formation and an increase of insoluble alpha-synuclein protein. Such delayed neuronal death was observed in a mutant alpha-synuclein protein level-dependent manner, which was slightly inhibited by a c-jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor and a caspase inhibitor. Such cell death was not observed when the same ES cell lines were differentiated into oligodendrocytes.

The pathological hallmarks of the disease are beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss and reactive gliosis. The current therapeutic effort is directed towards developing drugs that reduce Abeta burden or toxicity by inhibiting secretase cleavage, Abeta aggregation, Abeta toxicity, Abeta metal interactions or by promoting Abeta clearance. A number of clinical trials are currently in progress based on these different therapeutic strategies and they should indicate which, if any, of these approaches will be efficacious. Current diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made by clinical, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging assessments. Routine structural neuroimaging evaluation with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is based on non-specific features such as atrophy, a late feature in the progression of the disease, hence the crucial importance of developing new approaches for early and specific recognition at the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography, possibly in conjunction with other related Abeta biomarkers in plasma and CSF, could prove to be valuable in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, as well as in assessing prognosis. With the advent of new therapeutic strategies there is increasing interest in the development of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography radioligands that will permit the assessment of Abeta burden in vivo.</AbstractText>"}

Genetic polymorphism seems to determine the different family variants. One of the most enigmatic and unusual is Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI), a hereditary disorder characterised by loss of physiological sleep with oneiric stupor, autonomic and motor hyperactivity, and motor anomalies. The polysomnography of this entity reflects an inability to produce the physiological pattern of NREM and REM sleep, as well as hormonal and vegetative circadian fluctuations; the transition from wakefulness to sleep is markedly altered with the early disappearance sleep spindles.

Although promising results are beginning to be obtained in the treatment of dementias, clinical trials with NMDAR antagonists for stroke, trauma and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Hungtinton's disease, have failed before. In order to design effective therapies to prevent excitotoxic neuronal death, it is critical to characterize the consequences of excessive NMDAR activation on its expression and function. Previous data have reported partial downregulation of the NR1 and NR2B receptor subunits in response to excitotoxicity and cerebral ischemia. However, the effect of NMDAR overactivation on NR2A, a subunit fundamental to synaptic transmission and neuronal survival, is still elusive. In this study, we report the rapid and extensive proteolytic processing of NR2A, together with the scaffolding protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), induced by excitotoxic stimulation of cortical neurons in vitro and by transient focal cerebral ischemia. Processing of the C terminus of NR2A is irreversibly induced by brief agonist exposure of NR2B-containing receptors, and requires calcium influx and the activity of calpain, also responsible for PSD-95 cleavage. The outcome is a truncated NR2A subunit that is stable and capable to interact with NR1 at the surface of neurons, but lacking the structural domains required for association with scaffolding, downstream signaling and cytoskeletal proteins. Therefore, a rapid and significant uncoupling of synaptic NMDARs from downstream survival pathways is expected to occur during ischemia. This novel mechanism induced by excitotoxicity helps to explain the failure of most therapies based on NMDAR antagonists.</AbstractText>"}

Deregulation of their role may subvert the homeostasis of a given tissue and collaborate in the genesis of a myriad of diseases characterised by exacerbated or insufficient apoptosis, including diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases or cancer. Structural studies have defined homology regions shared by the members of the family that are responsible of the network of interactions established amongst the members of the family. These proteins usually form heterodimers between the so called antiapoptotic multidomain members and the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. As a consequence, mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins are released to the cytoplasm and the apoptotic signal proceeds towards the final, execution phase of the apoptotic process. The high complexity of the family (more than 20 members have been isolated) makes the study of individual proteins difficult. Genetic approaches have revealed a high degree of redundancy in the family. Only a few proteins belonging to the antiapoptotic group have been proven to be essential for correct embryonic development. Genetic inactivation in mice shows a dramatic phenotype characterised by massive cell death in multiple tissues during embryogenesis, which leads from very early up to perinatal death. This genetic evidence proves the importance of the members of the family for the regulation of apoptosis in order to achieve the proper development and homeostasis of tissues and organs.</AbstractText>"}

Cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by a marked inflammatory reaction that is initiated by expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory mediators, including prostanoids and nitric oxide. This review discusses recent advances regarding the detrimental effects of inflammation, the regulation of inflammatory signalling pathways in various diseases, and the potential molecular targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that mediate fundamental biological processes and cellular responses to external stress signals. Increased activity of MAPK, in particular p38 MAPK, and their involvement in the regulation of the synthesis of inflammation mediators at the level of transcription and translation, make them potential targets for anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Inhibitors targeting p38 MAPK and JNK pathways have been developed, and preclinical data suggest that they exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. This review discusses how these novel drugs modulate the activity of the p38 MAPK and JNK signalling cascades, and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical disease models, primarily through the inhibition of the expression of inflammatory mediators. Use of MAPK inhibitors emerges as an attractive strategy because they are capable of reducing both the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their signalling. Moreover, many of these drugs are small molecules that can be administered orally, and initial results of clinical trials have shown clinical benefits in patients with chronic inflammatory disease.</AbstractText>"}

Nitric oxide acts as a messenger, activating soluble guanylyl cyclase and participating in the transduction signalling pathways involving cyclic GMP. Nitric oxide also binds to cytochrome c oxidase, and is able to inhibit cell respiration in a process that is reversible and in competition with oxygen. This action can also lead to the release of superoxide anion from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Here, we discuss recent evidence that this mitochondrial interaction represents a molecular switch for cell signalling pathways involved in the control of physiological functions. These include superoxide- or oxygen-dependent modulation of gene transcription, calcium-dependent cell signalling responses, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential or AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent control of glycolysis. In pathophysiological conditions, such as brain ischaemia or neurological disorders, NO is formed excessively by NMDA receptor over-activation in neurons, or by inducible NO synthase from neighbouring glia (microglial cells and astrocytes). Elevated NO concentrations can then interact with superoxide anion, generated by the mitochondria or by other mechanisms, leading to the formation of the powerful oxidant species peroxynitrite. During pathological conditions activation of the NAD(+)-consuming enzyme poly(APD-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is also a likely mechanism for NO-mediated energy failure and neurotoxicity. Activation of PARP-1 is, however, a repair process, which in milder forms of oxidative stress protects neurons from death. Thus, whilst NO plays a physiological role in neuronal cell signalling, its over-production may cause neuronal energy compromise leading to neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

However, the common pathogenic mechanisms of neuronal death are still largely unknown. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a potential 'lowest common denominator' linking these disorders. In this review, we discuss the body of evidence supporting the role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of hereditary neurodegenerative diseases. We summarize the principal features of genetic diseases caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial proteins encoded by the mitochondrial or the nuclear genomes. We then address genetic diseases where mutant proteins are localized in multiple cell compartments, including mitochondria and where mitochondrial defects are likely to be directly caused by the mutant proteins. Finally, we describe examples of neurodegenerative disorders where mitochondrial dysfunction may be 'secondary' and probably concomitant with degenerative events in other cell organelles, but may still play an important role in the neuronal decay. Understanding the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to neurodegeneration and its pathophysiological basis will significantly impact our ability to develop more effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

A case in point concerns antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type of glutamate receptor (NMDAR). Glutamate receptors are essential to the normal function of the central nervous system. However, their excessive activation by excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate itself, is thought to contribute to neuronal damage in many neurological disorders ranging from acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury to chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The dual role of NMDARs in particular for normal and abnormal functioning of the nervous system imposes important constraints on possible therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating neurological diseases. Blockade of excessive NMDAR activity must therefore be achieved without interference with its normal function. In general, NMDAR antagonists can be categorized pharmacologically according to the site of action on the receptor-channel complex. These include drugs acting at the agonist (NMDA) or co-agonist (glycine) sites, channel pore, and modulatory sites, such as the S-nitrosylation site where nitric oxide (NO) reacts with critical cysteine thiol groups. Because glutamate is thought to be the major excitatory transmitter in the brain, generalized inhibition of a glutamate receptor subtype like the NMDAR causes side-effects that clearly limit the potential for clinical applications. Both competitive NMDA and glycine antagonists, even although effective in preventing glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity, will cause generalized inhibition of NMDAR activities and thus have failed in many clinical trials. Open-channel block with the property of uncompetitive antagonism is the most appealing strategy for therapeutic intervention during excessive NMDAR activation as this action of blockade requires prior activation of the receptor. This property, in theory, leads to a higher degree of channel blockade in the presence of excessive levels of glutamate and little blockade at relatively lower levels, for example, during physiological neurotransmission. Utilizing this molecular strategy of action, we review here the logical process that we applied over the past decade to help develop memantine as the first clinically tolerated yet effective agent against NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity. Phase 3 (final) clinical trials have shown that memantine is effective in treating moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease while being well tolerated. Memantine is also currently in trials for additional neurological disorders, including other forms of dementia, glaucoma, and severe neuropathic pain. Additionally, taking advantage of memantine's preferential binding to open channels and the fact that excessive NMDAR activity can be down-regulated by S-nitrosylation, we have recently developed combinatorial drugs called NitroMemantines. These drugs use memantine as a homing signal to target NO to hyperactivated NMDARs in order to avoid systemic side-effects of NO such as hypotension (low blood pressure). These second-generation memantine derivatives are designed as pathologically activated therapeutics, and in preliminary studies appear to have even greater neuroprotective properties than memantine.</AbstractText>"}

However, subsequent studies revealed that the TRAIL system, comprising the family of signal-mediating and decoy TRAIL receptors, (i) can also induce death of non-transformed cells, (ii) has potent immunoregulatory functions, and (iii) exhibits a unique expression pattern in the central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, TRAIL is not expressed within the human brain, while apoptosis-inducing TRAIL receptors are found differently distributed on neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. These findings rule out a major contribution of TRAIL to the so-called 'immune privilege' of the brain, in which local inflammation is limited, although such a role has previously been suggested for the CD95 (Fas) ligand belonging to the same TNF/nerve growth factor (NGF) family. If, under pathologic circumstances, the CNS is inflamed, immune cells such as macrophages and T cells upregulate TRAIL upon activation and use this death ligand as a weapon, not only against tumor cells but also against neurons and oligodendrocytes within the inflamed CNS. In parallel, a profound immunoregulatory impact of TRAIL on activation and proliferation of encephalitogenic T cells outside the brain has also been shown. Thus, these studies have uncovered a complex action of TRAIL on CNS pathology, indicating the possible value of targeted manipulation of the TRAIL system for the treatment of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

Reasons for this include the relative rarity of mitochondrial disease, the heterogeneity of mitochondrial disease, the natural cofactor status and easy 'over the counter availability' of CoQ10 all of which make funding for the necessary large blinded clinical trials unlikely.

Several recent studies, however, suggest that these types of stem cells might be able to break barriers of germ layer commitment and differentiate in vitro and/or in vivo into cells of different tissues, such as neuroectodermal cell types. Recently, protocols for high-yield generation of undifferentiated neural stem cell (NSC)-like cells from MSCs of primate and human origin were reported. Undifferentiated NSCs are commonly used and are more suitable for neurotransplantation compared with fully differentiated neural cells, as differentiated neural cells are well known to poorly survive detachment and subsequent transplantation procedures. These human MSC-derived NSC-like cells (MSC-NSCs) grow in neurosphere-like structures and express high levels of early neuroectodermal markers, but lose characteristics of MSCs. In the presence of selected growth factors, human MSC-NSCs can be differentiated into the three main neural phenotypes: astroglia, oligodendroglia and neurons. Compared with direct differentiation of human MSCs into mature neural cells, the conversion step seems to be essential to generate mature functional neuroectodermal cells. This review describes the techniques for the conversion of human MSCs into NSCs and summarises the data on epigenetic conversion of human MSCs into immature neuroectodermal cells. These cells provide a powerful tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of neural differentiation, and might serve as an autologous cell source to treat acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Each neurotrophin can signal through two different transmembrane receptors, Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophin receptor, the first member of the TNF receptor superfamily. Neurotrophic factors play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disease and eating disorders. Indeed, a number of approaches have been taken to use neurotrophins to treat Alzheimer's dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and peripheral sensory neuropathy. However, many of these clinical trails have failed, due to problems in delivery and unforeseen side effects of neurotrophic factors. An alternative approach is to use ligands in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family to transactivate trophic activities. We have discovered that treatment with adenosine, a neuromodulator that acts through G protein-coupled receptors, is capable of activating Trk tyrosine kinase receptors. Transactivation of neurotrophic receptors by GPCR ligands raise the possibility that small molecules may be used to elicit neurotrophic effects for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This approach would allow for selective targeting of neurons that express specific G protein-coupled receptors and trophic factor receptors. GPCRs transduce information provided by extracellular signals to modulate synaptic activity and neurotransmission. In addition to the classical G protein signalling, GPCR ligands also activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including neurotrophin receptors. Activation of Trk neurotrophin receptors can occur by GPCR ligands in the absence of neurotrophins. Adenosine and PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide) induce Trk activation specifically through their respective GPCRs to promote cell survival. Transactivation of Trks by GPCRs has emerged as a new theme in the biology of neurotrophin function. Although the precise role of transactivation is unknown, one possibility is that it adds a safety factor that might protect neurons from death in the absence of neurotrophins. Abnormal activity of the neurotrophin system has been implicated in several psychiatric and neurobiological illnesses. However, the lack of knowledge about the precise site of neurotrophin dysfunction has compromised the ability to improve the efficacy and the safety of drugs used in treatment modalities. If small-molecule GPCR ligands can ameliorate neuronal cell loss through Trk, transactivation may offer a new strategy for promoting trophic effects during neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

All these receptors are expressed by brain astroglia and microglia. In astrocytes, P2 receptors have been implicated in short-term calcium-dependent cell-cell communication. Upon mechanical stimulation or activation by other transmitters, astrocytes release ATP and respond to ATP with a propagating wave of intracellular calcium increases, allowing a homotypic astrocyte-astrocyte communication, as well as an heterotypic signalling which also involves neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglia. Astrocytic P2 receptors also mediate reactive astrogliosis, a reaction contributing to neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. Signalling leading to inflammatory astrogliosis involves induction of cyclo-oxygenase 2 through stimulation of ERK1,2 and of the transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Microglia also express several P2 receptors linked to intracellular calcium increases. P2 receptor subtypes are differentially regulated by typical proinflammatory signals for these cells (e.g. lipopolysaccharide), suggesting specific roles in brain immune responses. Globally, these findings highlight the roles of P2 receptors in glial cell pathophysiology suggesting a contribution to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by excessive gliosis and neuro-inflammation.

Over-activation of proline-directed kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), has been implicated in the aberrant phosphorylation of tau at proline-directed sites. In this study we tested the roles of Cdk5 and GSK3 in tau hyperphosphorylation in vivo using transgenic mice with p25-induced Cdk5 over-activation. We found that over-activation of Cdk5 in young transgenic animals does not induce tau hyperphosphorylation at sites recognized by the antibodies AT8, AT100, PHF-1, and TG3. In fact, we observed that Cdk5 over-activation leads to inhibition of GSK3. However, in old transgenic animals the inhibition of GSK3 is lost and results in increased GSK3 activity, which coincides with tau hyperphosphorylation at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 in old transgenic mice by chronic treatment with lithium leads to a reduction of the age-dependent increase in tau hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that Cdk5, GSK3, and PP2A co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting a functional association of these molecules. Together, these results reveal the role of GSK3 as a key mediator of tau hyperphosphorylation, whereas Cdk5 acts as a modulator of tau hyperphosphorylation via the inhibitory regulation of GSK3. Furthermore, these findings suggest that disruption of regulation of GSK3 activity underlies tau hyperphosphorylation in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Hence, GSK3 may be a prime target for therapeutic intervention in tauopathies including Alzheimer disease.</AbstractText>"}

They can be useful to dozens, if not hundreds, of patients with various disorders, such as cardiopathy, diabetes, some types of cancer, osteoarticular and neurodegenerative disorders. In these fields, numerous clinical applications are possible for mesenchymal stem cells. Cell and tissue (corneas, bone, skin) therapy products require the definition of pharmaceutical standards with new European requirements in terms of quality and safety. The legitimacy of the Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS) in cell and tissue engineering activities is established, it is recognized by most specialists and by regulatory authorities and has been asserted by the orientations of its 'contrat d'objectifs et de moyens'. An independent committee has been set up by the EFS President to define an EFS-specific strategy. This committee made up of qualified specialists was required to draw up a rational organization plan for these activities, in order for EFS to be in a position to produce cells and tissues according to pharmaceutical standards. The committee proposals are based on economic data and an inventory of existing cell and tissue engineering activities. Public/private partnerships are required and efforts must focus towards the industrial valorization of EFS expertise in R&amp;D activities and staff know-how. Implementing such a new organization requires national management and the cooperation of institutional actors (university hospitals, cancer treatment centers, universities). For the success of this approach, EFS personnel must be convinced of its legitimacy and new skills must be encouraged. With its numerous assets, EFS can be ambitious and assert itself as a major actor in cell and tissue engineering in Europe.</AbstractText>"}

In this paper, we will see that disruption of the Histone acetyl transferase (HAT)/Deacetylase (HDAC) balance is often observed in different contexts of neurological disorders and more particularly during neuronal apoptosis. During the last 5 years, it has been evidenced that the chromatin acetylation status was greatly impaired in different neurodegenerative diseases, a common mechanism being the loss of function of a specific HAT: the CREB-binding protein (CBP). We will review the last attempts of the use of small molecules antagonizing HDAC activity (HDAC inhibitors) to restore proper levels of acetylation and enhance neuronal survival, both in in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases such as polyglutamine-related diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Cholinergic dysfunction is thought to underpin several key symptoms. There is known pathologic involvement of the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loops in PSP, but little attention has been focused on potential thalamic dysfunction. Using autoradiography, we measured muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors in specific thalamic nuclei involved in the limbic and motor loops in patients with PSP (n = 11) and compared results from brain tissue of subjects with Lewy body dementias (including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 31), Alzheimer disease (n = 22) and normal elderly control subjects (n = 27). In the thalamus M2 receptors were more abundant than M4 receptors and were most densely concentrated in the anteroprincipal (AP) and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, which connect to limbic cortices. M2 receptor binding was reduced in the AP nucleus in PSP compared with control subjects and those with Lewy body dementias. M4 receptors were markedly reduced in the MD nucleus in those with PSP compared with control subjects. M4 receptors were also reduced in the subthalamic nucleus in patients with PSP. M4 receptor binding was reduced in the MD nucleus in the Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease groups compared with control subjects. There were no significant changes in the ventrolateral nucleus (motor). Cholinergic dysfunction within the AP and MD nuclei of the thalamus may contribute to behavioral and cognitive disturbances associated with PSP.</AbstractText>"}

The AD brain pathology is characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles but also (among other aspects) by signs of a chronic inflammatory process. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of developing AD and delays its onset. Classical targets of NSAIDs include cycloxygenase, nuclear factor kappaB, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Modulation of these pathways, all of which have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, could explain the NSAID effect on AD progression. However, recent studies indicate that a subset of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen may have direct Abeta-lowering properties in cell cultures as well as transgenic models of AD-like amyloidosis. A renewed interest in the old and a discovery of new pharmacological properties of these drugs are providing vital insight for future clinical trials. In this review we will summarize how the combination of traditional (anti-inflammatory) and new (anti-amyloidogenic) properties of some NSAIDs is providing unprecedented opportunities for drug discovery and could potentially result in novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AD.</AbstractText>"}

The emergence of increasingly sophisticated methods for measuring brain volume has facilitated correlation of local changes in tissue content with cognitive and behavioural changes in neurodegenerative disease. The current study examined neuroanatomical correlates of behavioural abnormalities, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, in 148 patients with dementia using voxel-based morphometry. Of 12 behaviours examined, 4 correlated with tissue loss: apathy, disinhibition, eating disorders and aberrant motor behaviour. Increasing severity across these four behaviours was associated with tissue loss in the ventral portion of the right anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and adjacent ventromedial superior frontal gyrus (vmSFG), the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC) more posteriorly, the right lateral middle frontal gyrus, the right caudate head, the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right anterior insula. In addition, apathy was independently associated with tissue loss in the right vmSFG, disinhibition with tissue loss in the right subgenual cingulate gyrus in the VMPC, and aberrant motor behaviour with tissue loss in the right dorsal ACC and left premotor cortex. These data strongly support the involvement of the right hemisphere in mediating social and emotional behaviour and highlight the importance of distinct regions on the medial wall of the right frontal lobe in regulating different behaviours. Furthermore, the findings underscore the utility of studying patients with dementia for understanding the neuroanatomical basis of social and emotional functions.</AbstractText>"}

The short peptides, derived from the degradation of MAGE transcripts, are the source of antigens that cause tumor rejection reactions when presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex. The recent discovery of a subset of genes that contain the structurally conserved MAGE homology domain (MHD) has accelerated the investigation into the normal function of MAGE genes. This new type of MAGE gene is normally expressed in embryonal and adult tissue, especially the brain. MAGE-D1, also known as NRAGE or Dlxin-1, functions as an adaptor protein that mediates multiple signaling pathways, including NGFR (p75NTR) and UNC5H1-induced apoptosis and Dlx/Msx-mediated transcription. Loss of a different MAGE family member, Necdin, which works as a cell cycle regulator, may play a role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome, a neurobehavioral disorder. In this article, the authors discuss recent findings concerning the structure and function of new MAGE genes, primarily focusing on MAGE-D1. Because some MAGE-D subfamily proteins share significant homology within the MHD, these recent discoveries on MAGE-D1 may give insight into the function of other MAGE-D proteins.</AbstractText>"}

The identification of molecular mitochondrial drug targets in combination with the development of methods for selectively delivering biologically active molecules to the site of mitochondria will eventually launch a multitude of new therapies for the treatment of mitochondria-related diseases, which are based either on the selective protection, repair, or eradication of cells. Yet, while tremendous efforts are being undertaken to identify new mitochondrial drugs and drug targets, the development of mitochondria-specific drug carrier systems is lagging behind. To ensure a high efficiency of current and future mitochondrial therapeutics, delivery systems need to be developed, which are able to selectively transport biologically active molecules to and into mitochondria within living human cells.

Several brainstem regions have been implicated in RBD pathophysiology, although the exact mechanism of the disorder in humans remains to be clarified. On clinical grounds, differentiation of RBD should be made from several non-REM parasomnias and other aberrant behaviours occurring during sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed on the basis of a systematic medical, neurological and psychiatric evaluation of the patient, assisted by a standard polysomnographic recording that includes continuous overnight videotaping; a brain imaging study is mandatory when an underlying brain disease is being suspected.

The reason for the concern relates to the possibility of the transmission of prions and the risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder such as Creutzveldt-Jacob disease. The purpose of this study was to quantify the amount of protein contamination that occurs, and to relate this to the number of times the Laryngeal Mask Airway has been used. Fifty previously used Classic Laryngeal Masks were collected after routine sterilization and packaging. The devices were immersed in protein detecting stain and then visual inspection performed to assess the degree and distribution of the staining. The researcher was blinded to the number of times the Laryngeal Mask Airway had been used. Linear regression analysis of the degrees of staining of the airway revealed that protein contamination occurs after the first use of the device and this increases with each subsequent use. This finding highlights the concern that the currently used cleaning and sterilization methods do not prevent the accumulation of proteinaceous material on Laryngeal Mask Airways.

These are assumed to arise as a consequence of deregulation of a normal pattern of topographic phosphorylation-that is, an abnormal shift of cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation from the normal axonal compartment to cell bodies. Although decades of studies have been directed to this problem, biochemical approaches in mammalian systems are limited: neurons are too small to permit separation of cell body and axon compartments. Since the pioneering studies of Hodgkin and Huxley on the giant fiber system of the squid, however, the stellate ganglion and its giant axons have been the focus of a large literature on the physiology and biochemistry of neuron function.

In the present study, we analyzed the influence of the selective A2AR antagonist SCH 58261 in a rat model of striatal excitotoxicity obtained by unilateral intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid (QA). We found that SCH 58261 differently affected the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induced by QA in cortex and striatum. The antagonist enhanced COX-2 expression in cortical neurons and prevented it in striatal microglia-like cells. Similarly, SCH 58261 differently regulated astrogliosis and microglial activation in the 2 brain regions. In addition, the A2AR antagonist prevented the QA-induced increase in striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Because COX-2 activity has been linked to excitotoxic processes and because brain-derived neurotrophic factor depletion has been observed in mouse models as well as in patients with Huntington disease, we suggest that the final outcome of A2AR blockade (namely neuroprotection vs neurodegeneration) is likely to depend on the balance among its various and region-specific effects.</AbstractText>"}

In rodents, inhibition of complex I leads to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as seen in PD, through activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic molecular pathways. In this scenario, complex I blockade increases the soluble pool of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial intermembrane space through oxidative mechanisms, whereas activation of pro-cell death protein Bax is actually necessary to trigger neuronal death by permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane and releasing cytochrome c into the cytosol. Activation of Bax after complex I inhibition relies on its transcriptional induction and translocation to the mitochondria. How complex I deficiency leads to Bax activation is currently unknown. Using gene-targeted mice, we show that the tumor suppressor p53 mediates Bax transcriptional induction after PD-related complex I blockade in vivo, but it does not participate in Bax mitochondrial translocation in this model, either by a transcription-independent mechanism or through the induction of BH3-only proteins Puma or Noxa. Instead, Bax mitochondrial translocation in this model relies mainly on the JNK-dependent activation of the BH3-only protein Bim. Targeting either Bax transcriptional induction or Bax mitochondrial translocation results in a marked attenuation of SNpc dopaminergic cell death caused by complex I inhibition. These results provide further insight into the pathogenesis of PD neurodegeneration and identify molecular targets of potential therapeutic significance for this disabling neurological illness.</AbstractText>"}

Thiamine deficiency (TD) reduces the activity of thiamine dependent-enzymes [e.g., the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC)], induces regional selective neurodegeneration and serves as a model of a mild impairment of oxidative metabolism. The current experiments tested whether changes in KGDHC protein subunits (E1k, E2k and E3) or activity or message levels underlie the selective loss of neurons in particular brain regions. Thus, TD-induced changes in these variables in the brain region most vulnerable to TD [the sub-medial thalamic nucleus (SmTN)] were compared to those in a region that is relatively resistant to TD (cortex) at stages of TD when the neuron loss in SmTN is not present, minimal or severe. Impaired motor performance on rotarod was apparent by 8 days of TD (-32%) and was severe by 10 days of TD (-97%). At TD10, the overall KGDHC activity measured by an in situ histochemical staining method declined 52% in SmTN but only 20% in cortex. Reductions in the E2k and E3 mRNA in SmTN occurred as early as TD6 (-28 and -18%, respectively) and were more severe by TD10 (-61 and -66%, respectively). On the other hand, the level of E1k mRNA did not decline in SmTN until TD10 (-48%). In contrast, TD did not alter mRNA levels of the subunits in cortex at late stages. Western blots and immunocytochemistry revealed different aspects of the changes in protein levels. In SmTN, the immunoreactivity of E1k and E3 by Western blotting increased 34 and 40%, respectively, only at TD8. In cortex, the immunoreactivity of the three subunits was not altered. Immunocytochemical staining of brain sections from TD10 mice indicated a reduction in the immunoreactivity of all subunits in SmTN, but not in cortex. These findings demonstrate that the response of the KGDHC activity, mRNA and immunoreactivity of E1k, E2k and E3 to TD is region and time dependent. Loss of KGDHC activity in cortex is likely related to post-translational modification rather than a loss of protein, whereas in SmTN transcriptional and post-translational modifications may account for diminished KGDHC activity.

{"PMID":16194581,"Title":"The beneficial effects of fruit polyphenols on brain aging.","Journal":"Neurobiology of aging","Date":"Dec 2005","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Brain aging is characterized by the continual concession to battle against insults accumulated over the years. One of the major insults is oxidative stress, which is the inability to balance and to defend against the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS cause oxidative damage to nucleic acid, carbohydrate, protein, and lipids. Oxidative damage is particularly detrimental to the brain, where the neuronal cells are largely post-mitotic. Therefore, damaged neurons cannot be replaced readily via mitosis. During normal aging, the brain undergoes morphological and functional modifications resulting in the observed behavioral declines such as decrements in motor and cognitive performance. These declines are augmented by neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Research from our laboratory has shown that nutritional antioxidants, such as the polyphenols found in blueberries, can reverse age-related declines in neuronal signal transduction as well as cognitive and motor deficits. Furthermore, we have shown that short-term blueberry (BB) supplementation increases hippocampal plasticity. These findings are briefly reviewed in this paper.</AbstractText>"}

The patient was a Japanese single woman without hereditary burden who was 58 years old at the time of death. At the age of 55 years, the patient began to feel anxiety, agitation and depressive in mood. At age 58 years, she developed marked character changes and emotional disorders, although disorientation and memory disturbance were slight. We suspected her disease was a variant of presenile dementia, especially Pick's disease, and some neuroradiological examinations disclosed bilateral temporal involvements. We could not make a definitive diagnosis from the clinical findings. She choked to death 3 years after the disease onset. From the neuropathological examinations, the known neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, including Pick's disease, were excluded and we diagnosed our case as having localized amygdala degeneration. Localized amygdala degeneration itself is very rare. Moreover, in this case, the amygdala degeneration was presumed to be idiopathic, without any apparent cause. To our knowledge, this is the first case of idiopathic localized amygdala degeneration. This case indicates that localized amygdala degeneration can cause presenile dementia, and that character changes and emotional disorders are predominant over memory disturbance and/or disorientation.</AbstractText>"}

Neuropathologically, bilateral marked neuronal loss and gliosis were restrictedly observed in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra and corpus luysii, whereas mild gliosis without neuronal loss was found in the brain stem. With Gallyas-Braak silver stain, numerous argyrophilic fibrous structures partly surrounding glial nuclei were observed in the three major affected regions. With Bodian stain, however, they were rarely recognized. The structures were partly positive for tau protein. Rare neurofibrillary tangles were found in the three areas and brain stem. They were relatively more numerous but still sparse in the hippocampus and the parahippocampus. The present case was diagnosed as having pallidonigro-luysian atrophy based on two characteristic findings: (i) the distribution of lesions showing neuronal loss with gliosis; and (ii) significant presence of tau-positive argyrophilic fibrous structures related to glia but with the absence of neurofibrillary tangles in the major affected regions and the brain stem. As our present case uniquely showed pure akinesia for the whole clinical course, it is noteworthy to report it here with a full neuropathological evaluation. In addition, a moderate number of diffuse plaques positive for beta-amyloid were distributed in the thalamus.</AbstractText>"}

To identify proteins sensitive to nitrating conditions in vivo, a comprehensive proteomic data set identifying 7792 proteins from a whole mouse brain, generated by LC/LC-MS/MS analyses, was used to identify nitrated proteins. This analysis resulted in the identification of 31 unique nitrotyrosine sites within 29 different proteins. More than half of the nitrated proteins that have been identified are involved in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or other neurodegenerative disorders. Similarly, nitrotyrosine immunoblots of whole brain homogenates show that treatment of mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), an experimental model of Parkinson's disease, induces an increased level of nitration of the same protein bands observed to be nitrated in brains of untreated animals. Comparing sequences and available high-resolution structures around nitrated tyrosines with those of unmodified sites indicates a preference of nitration in vivo for surface accessible tyrosines in loops, a characteristic consistent with peroxynitrite-induced tyrosine modification. In addition, most sequences contain cysteines or methionines proximal to nitrotyrosines, contrary to suggestions that these amino acid side chains prevent tyrosine nitration. More striking is the presence of a positively charged moiety near the sites of nitration, which is not observed for non-nitrated tyrosines. Together, these observations suggest a predictive tool of functionally important sites of nitration and that cellular nitrating conditions play a role in neurodegenerative changes in the brain.</AbstractText>"}

In contrast to other protein-misfolding disorders with similar neuropathogenesis, ALS is not always associated with the in vivo deposition of protein aggregates. Thus, under the assumption that all protein-misfolding disorders share at primary level a similar disease mechanism, ALS constitutes an interesting disease model for identifying the yet-mysterious precursor states from which the cytotoxic pathway emerges. In this study, we have mapped out the conformational repertoire of the apoSOD monomer through analysis of its folding behavior. The results allow us to target the regions of the SOD structure that are most susceptible to unfolding locally under physiological conditions, leading to the exposure of structurally promiscuous interfaces that are normally hidden in the protein's interior. The structure of this putative ALS precursor is strikingly similar to those implicated in amyloid disease.</AbstractText>"}

Previously, there has been limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of action for AMPA receptor potentiators. Here we present cocrystal structures of the glutamate receptor GluR2 S1S2 ligand-binding domain in complex with aniracetam [1-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-2-pyrrolidinone] or CX614 (pyrrolidino-1,3-oxazino benzo-1,4-dioxan-10-one), two AMPA receptor potentiators that preferentially slow AMPA receptor deactivation. Both potentiators bind within the dimer interface of the nondesensitized receptor at a common site located on the twofold axis of molecular symmetry. Importantly, the potentiator binding site is adjacent to the 'hinge' in the ligand-binding core 'clamshell' that undergoes conformational rearrangement after glutamate binding. Using rapid solution exchange, patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments, we show that point mutations of residues that interact with potentiators in the cocrystal disrupt potentiator function.

Deregulation of cdk5, as a result of calpain cleavage of p35 to a smaller p25 form, has been suggested to be a central component of neuronal death underlying numerous neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relevance of cdk5 in apoptotic death that relies on the mitochondrial pathway is unknown. Furthermore, evidence that cdk5 can also promote neuronal survival has necessitated a more complex understanding of cdk5 in the control of neuronal fate. Here we explore each of these issues using apoptotic and excitotoxic death models. We find that apoptotic death induced by the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin is associated with early transcription-mediated loss of p35 and with late production of p25 that is dependent on Bax, Apaf1, and caspases. In contrast, during excitotoxic death induced by glutamate, neurons rapidly produce p25 independent of the mitochondrial pathway. Analysis of the localization of p35 and p25 revealed that p35 is mainly cytoplasmic, whereas p25 accumulates selectively in the nucleus. By targeting a dominant-negative cdk5 to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, we show that cdk5 has a death-promoting activity within the nucleus and that this activity is required in excitotoxic death but not apoptotic death. Moreover, we also find that cdk5 contributes to pro-survival signaling selectively within the cytoplasm, and manipulation of this signal can modify death induced by both excitotoxicity and DNA damage.</AbstractText>"}

However, its various effects independent of PPARgamma have recently been observed. The effect of 15d-PGJ2 on neuronal cells is still controversial. We investigated its effect on neuronal cells (N18D3 cells). When N18D3 cells were treated with 15d-PGJ2, the viability was not changed up to 8 microM, but decreased at higher than 8 microM. The expressions of survival signals, such as p85a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospho-Akt, and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (Ser-9), slightly increased up to 8 microM, however, decreased at higher than 8 microM. The levels of free radicals and membrane lipid peroxidation and the expression of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase increased in a dose-dependent manner, especially at higher than 8 microM. However, the expressions of death signals, such as cytosolic cytochrome c, activated caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, decreased up to 8 microM, however, increased at higher than 8 microM. In the study to evaluate whether low dose of 15d-PGJ2, up to 8 microM, had protective effect on oxidative stress-injured N18D3 cells, compared to the cells treated with only 100 microM H2O2, the pretreatment with 8 microM 15d-PGJ2 increased the viability and the expressions of the survival signals, but decreased them of the death signals. These results indicate that 15d-PGJ2 could be a neuroprotectant or a neurotoxicant, depending on its concentration. Therefore, some specific optimum dose of 15d-PGJ2 may be a new potential therapeutic candidate for oxidative stress-injury model of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We have previously demonstrated in a novel in vivo transplantation model that chronic astro- and microgliosis resulted in molecular pathology similar to that observed in the Alzheimer's disease brain. We now report that these heterotopic, gliotic transplants exhibit prolonged oxidative stress, characterised by lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dietary additives can elevate endogenous anti-oxidant defences and reduce oxidative stress without attenuating astro- and microgliosis. We also show that administration of ibuprofen through the drinking water results in a similar reduction in oxidative stress but with no observable effect on glial reactivity. The present study lends support to the notion that dietary anti-oxidants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be potential preventative agents against some of the pathological processes associated with neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText>"}

We have recently observed that histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA) and SAHA, strongly potentiate the LPS induced inflammatory response in several rat and mouse inflammatory models. Our aim here was to characterise pro-inflammatory signaling mediated via increased protein acetylation and protein phosphorylation in microglial N9 cells. First we observed that TSA induced pro-inflammatory response was independent of the different Toll-like receptors activated, since LPS, flagellin and unmethylated CpG oligonucleotides, equally potentiated IL-6 secretion from N9 microglia. Next we compared the protein acetylation induced potentiation to that induced by okadaic acid, a well-known inducer of pro-inflammatory responses. The time scale of the IL-6 responses showed that the effects of okadaic acid were clearly early-response effects appearing as soon as 6h after exposure, whereas TSA evoked a significant inhibition in IL-6 secretion up to 12h but after that it induced an exponential increase in cytokine and nitric oxide production up to 24h. It seems that okadaic acid induces an early moderate response and TSA a late but exponential potentiation of microglial inflammatory responses. The pro-inflammatory responses of TSA and okadaic acid were both dependent on NF-kappaB signaling but independent on the DNA-binding capacity of nuclear NF-kappaB complexes. Interestingly, we observed that the transactivation of the NF-kappaB-Luc reporter gene was clearly activated during TSA induced pro-inflammatory potentiation. Our studies imply that the potentiation of the inflammatory response by increased acetylation is due to the enhancement of transactivation of NF-kappaB driven inflammatory genes. Our studies on signaling pathways revealed that PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin blocked the TSA induced pro-inflammatory response but surprisingly did not affect the okadaic acid induced response. Furthermore, LY294002 did not inhibit DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB but still inhibited NF-kappaB-Luc reporter gene transactivation. These results indicate that PI 3-kinase regulates the transactivation efficiency of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription rather than transduction of NF-kappaB signaling.</AbstractText>"}

However, the anatomical integrity and efficacy of connections among multiple brain regions change with aging, even in healthy adults. We combined low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation and positron emission tomography to study the age-related changes in regional activation and effective connectivity, associated with voluntary action by healthy adults between 22 and 68 years old. Contrasting effects of aging on the motor network were seen using analyses of regional activation, effective connectivity mediating task-related neuronal activation and effective connectivity in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Low-frequency rTMS reduced cerebral blood flow during both movement and resting conditions, at the site of stimulation and neighboring frontal cortex. Aging was associated with increased movement-related activation in premotor cortex, bilaterally. Increasing age also increased the susceptibility of the cortex to the inhibitory effects of rTMS, at the site of stimulation and its contralateral homologue. Moreover, older subjects showed enhanced local effective connectivity, centered on the left premotor cortex, but reduced effective connectivity between distant motor-related cortical areas. We discuss these results in relation to the HAROLD model of aging and propose that there are differential effects of aging on local and distributed neuronal subpopulations in the motor network. This differential effect of aging has important implications for the study of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases that primarily affect older people, as well as our understanding of the normal aging process.</AbstractText>"}

Both necrosis and apoptosis are generally believed to be distinct mechanisms of cell death with different characteristic features distinguished on the basis of their morphological and biochemical properties. The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body but not much is known about the mechanisms that regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. Recently, several clinical and biochemical studies suggest that cholesterol imbalance in the brain may be a risk factor related to the development of neurological disorders such as Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). NPC is a fatal juvenile neurodegenerative disorder characterized by premature neuronal death and somatically altered cholesterol metabolism. The main biochemical manifestation in NPC is elevated intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol caused by a genetic deficit in cholesterol trafficking. The pharmacological agent, U18666A (3-beta-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one), is a well-known class-2 amphiphile which inhibits cholesterol transport. Cells treated with this agent accumulate intracellular cholesterol to massive levels, similar to that observed in cells from NPC patients. NPC and AD have some pathological similarities which may share a common underlying cause. AD is one of the most common types of dementia affecting the elderly. However, the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in NPC and AD are largely unknown. This review provides a consolidation of work done using U18666A in the past half century and focuses on the implications of our research findings on the mechanism of U18666A-mediated neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical neurons, which may provide an insight to elucidate the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly NPC and AD, where apoptosis might occur through a similar mechanism.</AbstractText>"}

Although the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases may be distinct, different diseases display a similar pathogenesis, for example abnormal immunity within the central nervous system (CNS), activation of macrophage/microglia and the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent studies show that neurons in a neurodegenerative state undergo a highly regulated programmed cell death, also called apoptosis. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF family, has been shown to be involved in apoptosis during many diseases. As one member of a death ligand family, TRAIL was originally thought to target only tumor cells and was not present in CNS. However, recent data showed that TRAIL was unregulated in HIV-1-infected and immune-activated macrophages, a major disease inducing cell during HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). TRAIL is also induced on neuron by beta-amyloid protein, an important pathogen for Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we summarize the possible common aspects that TRAIL involved those neurodegenerative diseases, TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling in the CNS cells, and specific role of TRAIL in individual diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Animals were primed to exhibit dyskinesia by daily administration of levodopa until stable dyskinesia was evoked by each dose. Locomotor activity, motor disability and dyskinesia were assessed weekly at baseline and following an acute levodopa challenge. Prior to pallidotomies, two distinct groups of animals emerged: poor responders to levodopa with mild dyskinesia (Group 1) and those exhibiting a marked increase in motor activity and pronounced dyskinesia (Group 2). Electrolytic lesions were placed in the left internal segment of the globus pallidus. Pallidotomy had no effect on basal or levodopa-induced motor activity in either group but significantly improved basal motor disability in Group 2. Following pallidotomy, the ability of levodopa to reduce motor disability was significantly increased in both groups. Pallidotomy improved dyskinesia in both Groups 1 and 2 but it was more effective in reducing dystonia compared with chorea. The effect of pallidotomy on dyskinesia in Group 2 was transient, with the intensity of involuntary movements reverting to presurgery levels 4 weeks later. This study shows that in levodopa-primed, parkinsonian marmosets, placement of discrete globus pallidus lesions can ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesia but not akinesia.

NAP (Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln) is an octapeptide that has shown neuroprotective effects in various in vitro and in vivo neurodegenerative models. Previous studies showed that NAP protected against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, inhibited Abeta aggregation, and, by binding to tubulin, prevented disruption of microtubules. In this study, we investigated the effect of NAP on Abeta and tau pathology using a transgenic mouse model that recapitulates both aspects of AD. We administered NAP intranasally (0.5 microg/mouse per day, daily from Monday through Friday) for 3 mo, starting from 9 mo of age, which is a prepathological stage in these mice. NAP treatment significantly lowered levels of Abeta 1-40 and 1-42 in brain. In addition, NAP significantly reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated tau. Of particular interest, hyperphosphorylation at the threonine 231 site was reduced; phosphorylation at this site influences microtubule binding. Our results indicate that NAP treatment of transgenic mice initiated at an early stage reduced both Abeta and tau pathology, suggesting that NAP might be a potential therapeutic agent for AD.</AbstractText>"}

Data obtained by quantitative RT-PCR analysis show that treatment with P, DHP, or THP increases mRNA levels of Krox-20. This stimulatory effect anticipates that exerted by P and DHP on Sox-10 gene expression. Thus, although the effect on Krox-20 occurs after 1 h, that on Sox-10 reaches a peak after 2 h. A similar pattern of effect is also evident on their protein levels. As evaluated by Western blot analysis, Krox-20 is increased after 3 h of treatment with P, DHP, or THP, whereas P or DHP stimulates the expression of Sox-10 after 6 h of exposure. A computer analysis performed on rat and human promoters of these two transcription factors shows that putative P-responsive elements are present in Krox-20 but not in Sox-10. Interestingly, many putative binding sites for Krox-20 are present in the Sox-10 promoter. The observations reported here, together with the concept that P and its derivatives are able to influence directly the expression of myelin proteins, suggest that these neuroactive steroids might coordinate the Schwann cell-myelinating program utilizing different intracellular pathways.</AbstractText>"}

This is accompanied by an altered expression of the circadian clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus/nuclei (SCN), the principal circadian pacemaker in the brain. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and its receptor VPAC2 are highly expressed in the SCN, and VIPergic signaling plays an essential role in maintenance of ongoing circadian rhythmicity. We found a marked reduction in both VIP mRNA and VPAC2 receptor mRNA, quantified by RT-PCR, as well as a decrease in VIP immunostaining in the SCN of R6/2 mice. These changes were coupled to a disruption of circadian rhythm. We observed no loss of neurons in the SCN and therefore suggest that the changes in VIP and VPAC2 receptor are due to their decreased expression.

The crucial role of lipids in cell signaling and tissue physiology is demonstrated by the many neurological disorders, including bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Niemann-Pick diseases, that involve deregulated lipid metabolism. Altered lipid metabolism is also believed to contribute to cerebral ischemic (stroke) injury. Lipidomics will provide a molecular signature to a certain pathway or a disease condition. Lipidomic analyses (characterizing complex mixtures of lipids and identifying previously unknown changes in lipid metabolism) together with RNA silencing, using small interfering RNA (siRNA), may provide powerful tools to elucidate the specific roles of lipid intermediates in cell signaling and open new opportunities for drug development.</AbstractText>"}

However, available antioxidants have not proven to be particularly effective against many of these disorders. A possibility is that some of the antioxidants do not reach the relevant sites of free radical generation, especially if mitochondria are the primary source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The SS (Szeto-Schiller) peptide antioxidants represent a novel approach with targeted delivery of antioxidants to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The structural motif of these SS peptides centers on alternating aromatic residues and basic amino acids (aromatic-cationic peptides). These SS peptides can scavenge hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Their antioxidant action can be attributed to the tyrosine or dimethyltyrosine residue. By reducing mitochondrial ROS, these peptides inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome c release, thus preventing oxidant-induced cell death. Because these peptides concentrate &gt;1000-fold in the inner mitochondrial membrane, they prevent oxidative cell death with EC50 in the nM range. Preclinical studies support their potential use for ischemia-reperfusion injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Although peptides have often been considered to be poor drug candidates, these small peptides have excellent 'druggable' properties, making them promising agents for many diseases with unmet needs.</AbstractText>"}

Olfactory bulbs from rat pups were rapidly trypsinised and mechanically dissociated and the resultant single cell suspension was centrifuged through a high bovine serum albumin concentration gradient to reduce cellular debris before being seeded in multi-well culture plates. Cells were plated in neurobasal medium containing 0.5 mM glutamine, 25 mM K(+), 2% B27 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 24 h and, after 1 day in vitro (div1), were maintained without FCS. At div8, neurones exhibited extensive neuritic networks, were present as a monolayer and were mainly bipolar and immunopositive for gamma-aminobutyric acid indicating that they were intrinsic OB neurones. At div8, neurones (positive for microtubule-associated protein-2, 73%) predominated over astrocytes (positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, 27%). Cellular injury produced by staurosporine, hydrogen peroxide and kainate, when assessed by morphological and biochemical procedures, was shown to be concentration-dependent and significantly reduced the numbers of neurones and astrocytes. Further analyses of kainate-induced injury revealed the presence of TUNEL-positive cells (indicative of apoptosis) and increases in intracellular free calcium, both of which were antagonised by CNQX. Thus, the serum-free culture developed here is amenable to morphological and high throughput neurochemical analyses of mechanisms contributing to the injury of OB neurones in vitro.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, mutations have been identified in the PRKCG gene in families with SCA14. The PRKCG gene encodes the protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma), a member of a serine/threonine kinase family involved in signal transduction important for several cellular processes, including cell proliferation and synaptic transmission. To identify the disease-causing mutation in a large group of ataxia patients, we searched for mutations in the PRKCG gene. We ascertained 366 unrelated patients with spinocerebellar ataxia, either pure or with associated features such as epilepsy, mental retardation, seizures, paraplegia, and tremor. A C-to-G transversion in exon 4, resulting in a histidine-to-glutamine change at codon 101 of the PKCgamma protein, was identified in patients from a family with slowly progressive pure cerebellar ataxia. Functional studies performed in HEK293 cells transfected with normal or mutant construct showed that this mutation affects PKCgamma stability or solubility, verified by time-dependent decreased protein levels in cell culture. In conclusion, the H101Q mutation causes slowly progressive uncomplicated ataxia by interfering with PKCgamma stability or solubility, which consequently may cause in either case a decrease in the overall PKCgamma-dependent phosphorylation.</AbstractText>"}

Study of the induction and consequences of oxidative stress in the peripheral tissues of the familial AD patients can help to elucidate the inherent abnormalities and the mechanism of pathogenesis of this disease. AD fibroblasts have been used as a model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of oxidative stress. In our study, we used AD fibroblasts from six different donors who are either at high risk of developing AD or have already been diagnosed with AD to study the effect of oxidative stress in comparison with the effect on non-AD normal human fibroblast. Oxidative stress was induced by a brief exposure of the cells to 250microM H(2)O(2) followed by incubation in normal conditions. Neuronal loss due to oxidative stress is a characteristic of Alzheimer's patients; however, our results showed that AD fibroblasts were more resistant to oxidative stress compared to non-AD fibroblasts. Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicated that AD fibroblasts produced more ROS than did non-AD NHF cells either in basal conditions or after induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that expression of p21 was significantly higher in AD cells than in non-AD cells and expression of Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein was downregulated/absent in AD cells during normal or under conditions of external oxidative stress. Further experiments revealed that mitochondria in AD cells moved to the peri-nuclear region following induction of oxidative stress. Thus, these results suggest that AD fibroblasts are chronically exposed to oxidative stress that may trigger senescent phenotype, making AD cell resistant to apoptosis by external oxidative stress.</AbstractText>"}

Premature death of cholinergic neurons and the formation of amyloid fibrils separately initiated the cholinergic and amyloid hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present evidence to the fact that these two distinct phenomena both associate with specific changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression within cholinergic neurons. For example, calcium misregulation promotes aberrant transcription and pro-apoptotic events, as well as AChE-induced modifications in cellular signal cascades. These reciprocally intercept with AChE regulation at the Endoplasmic Reticulum, modifying AChE gene expression, folding and signaling. Altered AChE properties may reflect changes in the enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic features of the multiple AChE splice variants. Under chronic cellular stress, aberrant AChE regulation may thus facilitate apoptotic pathways, promoting plaque formation, cognitive impairments and degeneration of cholinergic nerve cells.</AbstractText>"}

Because the NH2-terminal tyrosine is absolutely necessary for the neuropeptides to exert analgesic effects, and aminopeptidase activities are extraordinarily high in the brain, a specific 'amino-enkephalinase' should exist. Several aminopeptidases were identified in the central nervous system during the search. In fact, our laboratory found two novel neuron-specific aminopeptidases: NAP and NAP-2. NAP is the only functionally active brain-specific enzyme known. Its synaptic location coupled with its limited substrate specificity could constitute a 'functional' specificity and contribute to enkephalin-specific functions. In addition, NAP was found to be essential for neuron growth, differentiation, and death. Thus, aminopeptidases are likely important for mental health and neurological diseases. Recently, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) was identified as a modifier of tau-induced neurodegeneration. Because the enzymatic similarity between PSA and NAP, we believe that the depletion of NAP in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains plays a causal role in the development of AD pathology. Therefore, use of the puromycin-sensitive neuron-aminopeptidase NAP could provide neuroprotective mechanisms in AD and similar neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We then went on to examine both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms. EAE was induced in wild-type, ERalpha-, or ERbeta-deficient mice, and each was treated with the highly selective ERalpha agonist, propyl pyrazole triol, to determine the effect on clinical outcomes, as well as on inflammatory and neurodegenerative changes. ERalpha ligand treatment ameliorated clinical disease in both wild-type and ERbeta knock-out mice, but not in ERalpha knock-out mice, thereby demonstrating that the ERalpha ligand maintained ERalpha selectivity in vivo during disease. ERalpha ligand treatment also induced favorable changes in autoantigen-specific cytokine production in the peripheral immune system [decreased TNFalpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-6, with increased interleukin-5] and decreased CNS white matter inflammation and demyelination.

Bioinformatics tools were used for data evaluation. Briefly, raw data were imported into the NCTR ArrayTrack database, normalized using a Lowess method and data quality was assessed. The Student's t-test was used to determine significant changes in gene expression (set as p&lt;0.05, fold change &gt;1.5).

Moreover, they provide trophic support to tissue at risk in the penumbra surrounding the infarct area, enhance vasculogenesis, and help promote survival, migration, and differentiation of the endogenous precursor cells after stroke. Stem cells are highly migratory and seem to be attracted to areas of brain pathology such as ischemic regions. The pathotropism may follow the paradigm of stem cell homing to bone marrow and leukocytes migrating to inflammatory tissue. The molecular signaling therefore may involve various chemokines, cytokines, and integrins. Among these, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) signaling is required for the interaction of stem cells and ischemia-damaged host tissues. SDF-1 is secreted primarily by bone marrow fibroblasts and is required for BMSC homing to bone marrow. Overexpression of SDF-1 in ischemic tissues has been found to enhance stem cell recruitment from peripheral blood and to induce neoangiogenesis. Furthermore, SDF-1 expression in the lesioned area peaked within 7 days postischemia, in concordance with the time window of G-CSF therapy for stroke. Recent data have shown that SDF-1 expression is directly proportional to reduced tissue oxygen tension. SDF-1 gene expression is regulated by hypoxic-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a hypoxia-dependent stabilization transcription factor. Thus, ischemic tissue may recruit circulating progenitors regulated by hypoxia through differential expression of HIF-lalpha and SDF-1. In addition to SDF-1, beta2-integrins also play a role in the homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to sites of ischemia and are critical for their neovascularization capacity. In our recent report, increased expression of beta1-integrins apparently contributed to the local neovasculization of the ischemic brain as well as its functional recovery. Identification of the molecular pathways involved in stem cell homing into the ischemic areas could pave the way for the development of new treatment regimens, perhaps using small molecules, designed to enhance endogeneous mobilization of stem cells in various disease states, including chronic stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. For maximal functional recovery, however, regenerative therapy may need to follow combinatorial approaches, which may include cell replacement, trophic support, protection from oxidative stress, and the neutralization of the growth-inhibitory components for endogenous neuronal stem cells.</AbstractText>"}

In the developing fetal brain, reelin-signal transduction is critical for the correct positioning of neurons and the formation of appropriate synaptic connections, whereas in the mature brain, reelin participates in the mediation of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. An important 'downstream' consequence of the reelin-signal transduction cascade is inhibition of the phosphorylation of tau, a protein that regulates microtubule assembly and stability. Importantly, hyperphosphorylated tau comprises the paired helical filament, whose pathological deposition as neurofibrillary tangles is implicated in Alzheimer's disease; hyperphosphorylated tau is also implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders. Isoforms of apoE may affect the binding of reelin to its cell surface receptors and, thereby, influence tau phosphorylation, whereas insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and the lithium ion have actions within the cell at the level of the specific tyrosine kinases involved in the phosphorylation of tau. These data support the exploration of pharmacotherapeutic interventions designed to prevent or reduce the burden of hyperphosphorylated tau. Impaired reelin-signal transduction due to an actual deficiency of reelin expression may occur in at least some patients with psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia; conceivably, hyperphosphorylation of tau would result from deficient transduction of reelin in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia has been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder of impaired synaptic 'connectivity', whose consequence does not become fully apparent until late adolescence or early adulthood. In summary, hyperphosphorylation of tau may be an underlying point of pathological convergence for several neuropsychiatric disorders, and prevention of tau hyperphosphorylation may be an important therapeutic target.</AbstractText>"}

DNA testing is important for the diagnosis of these diseases because clinical discrimination is complicated by their late onset and frequently overlapping symptomatology. However, detection of pathologic alleles expanded up to several thousand trinucleotides poses a challenge for the introduction of rapid, fully automatic, and simple DNA diagnostic procedures. Here we propose a simple two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for rapid molecular diagnostics of myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and possibly also other triplet expansion diseases. Standard PCR amplification with target repeat flanking primers is used for the detection of alleles of up to 100 repeats; next, triplet-primed PCR is applied for detection of larger expansions. Automated capillary electrophoresis of amplicons allows rapid discrimination between normal, premutated and expanded (CTG/CAG)(n) alleles. Using the suggested protocol, the expanded allele was successfully detected in all test DNA samples with known genotypes. Our experience demonstrates that the suggested two-step PCR protocol provides high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility; is significantly less time-consuming; is easier to perform; and provides a better basis for automation than previous methods requiring Southern analysis. Therefore, it can be used for confirmation of uncertain clinical diagnoses, for prenatal testing in at-risk families, and, generally in research on these diseases.</AbstractText>"}

While the passive cell demise occurs in an accidental, violent and chaotic way, corresponding to 'necrosis', the active auto-elimination, defined 'programmed cell death' (PCD), is executed in planned modalities. Different PCD pathways have been described, such as apoptosis, autophagic death, para-apoptosis and programmed necrosis. However, death patterns may overlap or integrate, providing a variety of cellular responses to various circumstances or stimuli. The consequences for the whole organism of necrosis and PCD are quite different. In the case of classical necrosis, cytosolic constituents chaotically spill into extracellular space through damaged plasma membrane and provoke an inflammatory response, while in most PCDs the cellular components are safely isolated by membranes, and then consumed by adjacent parenchymal cells and/or resident phagocytes without inflammation. Thus, whereas the necrotic cell removal induces and amplifies pathological processes, the elimination of PCD debris may remain virtually unnoticed by the body. Otherwise, alterations of PCD controls may be involved in human diseases, such as developmental abnormalities, or neurodegenerative, autoimmune and neoplastic affections, whose treatment implies the complete understanding of cell suicide processes. In this review, the cellular death patterns are focused and their significance discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Clinically they manifest as hypopigmentation, abnormal bleeding and increased susceptibility to infection with various degrees of involvement of the nervous system. In the course of a recessive N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen, we identified the first murine missense mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene (Lyst(Ing3618)) located at a highly conserved position in the WD40 protein domain. Nearly all described human Lyst alleles lead to protein truncation and fatal childhood CHS. Only four different missense mutations have been reported in patients with adolescent or adult forms of CHS involving the nervous system. Interestingly, the Lyst(Ing3618) model presents with a predominant neurodegenerative phenotype with progressive degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells and lacks severe impairment of the immune system. Therefore, the Lyst(Ing3618 )allele could represent a new model for adult CHS with neurological impairment.

Thus, we focused on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a neurotrophic and angiogenic growth factor. At 7 days before injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the SNi, stereotaxic transfection of human HGF or lacZ plasmid was performed into the unilateral striatum of rats. Expression of human HGF in the injected sites could be detected in rats transfected with HGF plasmid DNA, using immunohistochemical staining. Consistently, human immunoreactive HGF protein could be detected at least up to 12 days after transfection. Interestingly, PD rats transfected with lacZ demonstrated amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry. However, transfection of HGF plasmid DNA resulted in significant inhibition of abnormal rotation up to 24 weeks in a dose-dependent manner. Over 90% of dopaminergic neurons were lost in PD rats transfected with lacZ, whereas over 70% survived in rats transfected with HGF, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Overall, the present study demonstrated that overexpression of HGF prevented neuronal death in a PD rat model, providing a potential novel therapy for PD.</AbstractText>"}

Deposition of extracellular neuritic, beta-amyloid peptide-containing plaques (senile plaques) in cerebral cortical regions of Alzheimer patients is accompanied by the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in cerebral pyramidal neurons. Basal forebrain cholinergic dysfunction is also a consistent feature of Alzheimer's disease, which has been suggested to cause, at least partly, the cognitive deficits observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Impaired cortical cholinergic neurotransmission may also contribute to beta-amyloid plaque pathology in Alzheimer's disease by affecting expression and processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Vice versa, low level of soluble beta-amyloid has been observed to inhibit cholinergic synaptic function. Deposition of beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease is also accompanied by a significant plaque-associated glial up-regulation of interleukin-1, which has been attributed to affect expression and metabolism of APP and to interfere with cholinergic transmission. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interrelationship between cortical cholinergic dysfunction, beta-amyloid formation and deposition, as well as local inflammatory upregulation, would allow to derive potential treatment strategies to pharmacologically intervene in the disease-causing signaling cascade.</AbstractText>"}

In the mature nervous system NF-kappaB is activated in synapses in response to excitatory synaptic transmission and may play a pivotal role in processes such as learning and memory. NF-kappaB is activated in neurons and glial cells in acute neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke and traumatic injury, as well as in chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Activation of NF-kappaB in neurons can promote their survival by inducing the expression of genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and the antioxidant enzyme Mn-superoxide dismutase. On the other hand, by inducing the production and release of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen molecules and excitotoxins, activation of NF-kappaB in microglia and astrocytes may contribute to neuronal degeneration. Emerging findings suggest roles for NF-kappaB as a mediator of effects of behavioral and dietary factors on neuronal plasticity.

Carnosine has been recently proposed to act as antioxidant in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate its neuroprotective effect in astrocytes exposed to LPS- and INFgamma-induced nitrosative stress. Carnosine protected against nitric oxide-induced impairment of mitochondrial function. This effect was associated with decreased formation of oxidatively modified proteins and with decreased up-regulation oxidative stress-responsive genes, such as Hsp32, Hsp70 and mt-SOD.

Several neurodegenerative diseases in humans, like Alzheimer's disease, have been intensely studied but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown for most of them. For those syndromes where associated gene products have been identified their biochemistry and physiological as well as pathogenic function is often still under debate. This is in part due to the inherent limitations of genetic analyses in humans and other mammals and therefore experimentally accessible invertebrate in vivo models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, have recently been introduced to investigate neurodegenerative syndromes. Several laboratories have used transgenic approaches in Drosophila to study the human genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This has added substantially to our understanding of the mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative diseases in humans. The isolation and characterization of Drosophila mutants, which display a variety of neurodegenerative phenotypes, also provide valuable insights into genes, pathways, and mechanisms causing neurodegeneration. So far only about two dozen such mutants have been described but already their characterization reveals an involvement of various cellular functions in neurodegeneration, ranging from preventing oxidative stress to RNA editing. Some of the isolated genes can already be associated with human neurodegenerative diseases and hopefully the isolation and characterization of more of these mutants, together with an analysis of homologous genes in vertebrate models, will provide insights into the genetic and molecular basis of human neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

To functionally dissect molecular components of the UPP in postmitotic neurons, we used RNA interference to knock down genes that encode genetically characterized components of the UPP. Here, we show that knockdown of two such components, the ubiquitin ligase scaffolding protein Cullin-1 (Cul-1) and the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating protein Pad-1, lead to cell cycle reactivation and apoptosis in subsets of postmitotic neurons. Furthermore, knockdown of Cul-1 appears to specifically affect the dopaminergic population.

Neurotrophic and differentiation factors that regulate gene expression for controlling neural cell fate and function determine the differentiation of neural progenitors in the developing mammalian brain. For clinical application of NSCs in neurodegenerative disorders and damaged neurons, there are several critical problems that remain to be resolved: 1) how to obtain enough NSCs from reliable sources for autologous transplantation; 2) how to regulate neural plasticity of different adult stem cells; 3) how to control differentiation of NSCs in the adult nervous system.

We investigated the role of the copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis by analyzing the early effects of SOD1 down-regulation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Through the use of small interference RNA, SOD1 was efficiently down-regulated at 48 h after transfection without any significant effect on cell viability. The steady-state concentration of superoxide was significantly increased after 12 h, when SOD1 was only slightly decreased, and progressively returned to values close to those observed in control cells. The superoxide increase was buffered by the enhanced levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH); however, GSH increase was not sufficient to avoid damage to proteins in terms of carbonyls. GSH-depleting agents, such as BSO or diamide, further increased protein damage and committed SOD1 deficient cells to death, confirming the pivotal role played by this antioxidant. Although SOD1 declined mostly in the cytosolic compartment, mitochondria were significantly affected with impairment of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and a decrease in ATP production. Together with these effects carbonylation of mitochondrial proteins was detected and in particular a consistent carbonylation and decrease of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These conditions induced a high susceptibility of SOD1-depleted cells to treatment with the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species producing agent rotenone. Overall, the results demonstrate that loss of SOD1 leads to severe damage of mitochondria, suggesting an important biological role for this enzyme in the preservation of mitochondrial homeostasis.</AbstractText>"}

No significant gross lesions were observed in field cases or experimentally induced cases. Spontaneous and induced histologic lesions were similar and included vacuolation, degeneration, and loss of Purkinje cells. Axonal spheroids, microcavitations, and other changes of wallerian-type degeneration in cerebellar white matter were also observed. Ultrastructural changes included increased number of electron-dense residual storage bodies in membrane-bound vesicles in affected Purkinje cells, and similar vesicles and mitochondria in axonal spheroids. No histologic lesions were detected in the other examined tissues. The Purkinje-cell swelling and vacuolation with subsequent cerebellar degeneration are suggestive of Purkinje-cell specific toxin that produces abnormal lysosome function and cell specific axonal transport.

Currently, the only suitable pharmacologic strategy for up-regulating autophagy in mammalian cells is to use rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a negative regulator of autophagy. Here we describe a novel mTOR-independent pathway that regulates autophagy. We show that lithium induces autophagy, and thereby, enhances the clearance of autophagy substrates, like mutant huntingtin and alpha-synucleins. This effect is not mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibition. The autophagy-enhancing properties of lithium were mediated by inhibition of inositol monophosphatase and led to free inositol depletion. This, in turn, decreased myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) levels. Our data suggest that the autophagy effect is mediated at the level of (or downstream of) lowered IP3, because it was abrogated by pharmacologic treatments that increased IP3. This novel pharmacologic strategy for autophagy induction is independent of mTOR, and may help treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, like Huntington's disease, where the toxic protein is an autophagy substrate.</AbstractText>"}

With suppression of PrP(C) expression, the incubation time for RML prions was prolonged almost threefold from approximately 150 to approximately 430 days. To determine the clearance rate of disease-causing PrP(Sc), bigenic mice were given oral doxycycline beginning 98 days after inoculation with RML prions and sacrificed at various time points over the subsequent 56 days. The half-life (t1/2) for PrP(Sc) was approximately 1.5 days in mouse brain, in reasonable agreement with the apparent t1/2 of 30 h that was determined in a separate study for scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells in culture. Both protease-sensitive and -resistant conformers of PrP(Sc) were cleared at the same rate. The t1/2 value for PrP(C) clearance from brain was approximately 18 h, which was considerably longer than the t1/2 of 5 h found in ScN2a cells. The capability of the brain to clear prions raises the possibility that PrP(Sc) is normally made at low levels and continually cleared, and that PrP(Sc) may have a function in cellular metabolism. Moreover, these bigenic mice make it possible to determine both components of PrP(Sc) accumulation, i.e. the rates of formation and clearance, for various strains of prions exhibiting different incubation times.</AbstractText>"}

Recent evidence indicates that polymorphic variation within GAPDH genes is associated with an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that GAPDH readily undergoes disulfide bonding following oxidant exposure, although the consequence of disulfide bonding on GAPDH activity or function is unknown. Here we show that increased GAPDH disulfide bonding is observed in detergent-insoluble extracts from AD patient and transgenic AD mouse brain tissue compared with age-matched controls. Exposure of primary rat cortical neurons to the pro-oxidant amyloid beta peptide promotes nuclear accumulation of a disulfide-linked form of GAPDH, which becomes detergent-insoluble. Disulfide bonding leads to a reduction in GAPDH enzymatic activity and correlates with the appearance of punctate aggregate-like GAPDH staining within the cytoplasm of both oxidant-treated HT22 cells and amyloid beta-treated primary cortical neurons.

To analyze the morphological alteration of the cells during inhibition of the phosphatases, we established a cell model showing steady outgrowth of axon-like cell processes and employed a stereological system to analyze the retraction of the processes. We found CA treatment inhibited outgrowth of the cell processes and prolonged treatment with CA caused retraction of the processes and meanwhile, the early neurodegenerative varicosities were also obvious in the CA-treated cells. We conclude suppression of PP-2A and PP-1 by CA not only damages intracellular transport but also leads to cell degeneration, which may serve as the functional and structural elements for the memory deficits induced by suppression of the phosphatases.</AbstractText>"}

Some mutants aggregate upon over-expression, but the effects of such aggregation on the UPS and neuronal survival have not been characterized. We show in this study that transient over-expression of wild type (WT) Parkin or various mutants in human neuroblastoma cells leads to localized accumulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP(u)), an artificial proteasomal substrate, indicative of UPS dysfunction. Parkin mutants, but not WT, aggregated, and GFP(u) and ubiquitin accumulated within such aggregates. Apoptotic death occurred only with mutant Parkin over-expression, and correlated with aggregation, but not GFP(u) accumulation. Enzymatic proteasomal activity was slightly increased with WT Parkin and decreased with mutant Parkin over-expression. This decrease was, at least in part, due to caspase activation. We conclude that mutant forms of Parkin can exert toxic effects on neuronal cells, possibly through their propensity to aggregate. Both WT and mutant forms can induce localized UPS dysfunction, likely through different mechanisms. This raises a note of caution regarding forced over-expression of Parkin as a neuroprotective strategy in PD or other neurodegenerative conditions and suggests a possible toxic gain of function for certain mutant forms of Parkin.</AbstractText>"}

We generated a high-capacity adenoviral (HC-Ad) vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to exon 1 of the htt gene. In vitro, this vector efficiently inhibited Htt expression in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines. In addition, the number of Htt-immunoreactive (IR) aggregates, a hallmark of HD pathology, was significantly reduced after gene transfer with this vector. Importantly, the attenuation of aggregate formation by shRNA was observed in vivo after stereotaxic injection into the striatum of mouse models of HD.

In both models an efficient reduction in mutant Htt aggregate load measured by decreased Htt-IR aggregate formation was observed.

Recent studies have suggested the astrocyte to be a key cell in mediating the inflammatory process in the brain and in expressing adhesion molecules and chemokines. Here I overview work in my laboratory and others that demonstrates interleukin-1 (IL-1) to be a key inducer of the expression of these molecules in astrocytes. The temporal expression is sustained in nature and this is due to prolonged activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB.

However, grafts of ENPs into animal models show variable survival and limited differentiation into neurones. The effect of expansion time on their ability to survive and differentiate may be an important factor in this and has not been examined directly. In these experiments, murine and human ENPs were expanded for short (4 weeks) and long (20 weeks) periods before transplantation into the adult rat striatum. Whereas grafts of both short- and long-term expanded human ENPs survived for 4 weeks following transplantation, by 20 weeks all long-term expanded grafts had disappeared. Murine ENPs behaved similarly: only grafts of short-term expanded ENPs survived at 12 weeks following transplantation. RT-PCR analysis of ENP cultures after 4 and 20 weeks of expansion demonstrated changes in expression of a number of different groups of genes. We conclude that long-term expansion of ENPs profoundly impairs their ability to survive long-term after transplantation into the adult brain.

One of the major culprits that contributes to delayed neuronal damage and death after a traumatic insult is the calcium ion. The original calcium hypothesis suggests that a large, sustained influx of calcium into cells initiates cell death signalling cascades. While much of this original tenant remains true, recent findings suggest that the role of calcium in traumatic neuronal injury may be more complex. For example, a sustained level of intracellular free calcium is not necessarily lethal, but the specific route of calcium entry may couple calcium directly to cell death pathways. Other sources of calcium, such as intracellular calcium stores, can also cause cell damage. In addition, calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways have been found to be altered following injury. These alterations are sustained for several hours and may contribute to dysfunction in neurons that do not necessarily die after a traumatic episode. This review provides an overview of experimental evidence that has led to our current understanding of the role of calcium in neuronal death and dysfunction after TBI. While the focus is on alterations in neuronal calcium homeostasis following mechanical injury, these findings may have implications for other pathological states of the brain, such as ischaemia and neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText>"}

Neurons in the SNPC are known to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH); therefore, in a commonly used PD model, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a selective catecholamine neurotoxin, induces neuronal death in SNPC. We have shown with immunohistochemical techniques that kynurenine aminotransferase-I (KAT-I), the enzyme taking part in the formation of kynurenic acid (KYNA)--the only known endogenous selective NMDA receptor antagonist and a potent neuroprotective agent--is also expressed in the rat SNPC. We found that KAT-I and TH co-exist in the very same neurons of SNPC and that 6-OHDA injected into the lateral ventricle produced loss of the majority of nigral neurons. Densitometric analysis proved that, in consequence of 6-OHDA treatment, not only TH but also KAT-I immunoreactivity diminished considerably in the remaining SNPC neurons. Astrocytes in the substantia nigra were found to express KAT-I under normal conditions; the amount of this enzyme increased after administration of 6-OHDA, whereas microglial cells became KAT-I immunoreactive only after 6-OHDA treatment. Since intrinsic KYNA in SNPC neurons is perceptibly insufficient to protect them from the deleterious effect of 6-OHDA, it is hypothesized that biochemical approaches which increase KYNA content of the central nervous system might prevent the deleterious effect of 6-OHDA and, supposedly, also the neuronal degradation characterizing PD.</AbstractText>"}

For Parkinson's disease this would mean that the metabolism of dopamine in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and presumably the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, together with one or more pathological factors contribute to the initial neurodegeneration. There are recent studies indicating that a transneuronal retrograde degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta neurons might be induced by a loss of function of dopaminergic synapses in the striatum. We have recently established an animal model of retrograde striato-nigral degeneration, where the assessment of markers for cellular stress is possible. In Parkinson's disease, several structures distal from the substantia nigra pars compacta undergo neuropathological changes, characterizing the 'secondary neurodegeneration. Our recent studies provide experimental evidence for a chronic cellular stress in these structures because of a relative or absolute glutamatergic overactivity due to the initial loss of dopaminergic innervation. Thus, a loss of dopamine transforms the basal ganglia to a 'destructive network'. Both processes, the 'primary' and 'secondary neurodegeneration', affecting each other, characterize the progress of chronic neurodegeneration. From this point of view, we would further like to develop strategies for symptomatic amendment. Excitatory amino acids seem to be involved not only in the secondary processes of neurodegeneration, but also in initiation of the 'primary degeneration' of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Therefore, a reduction of glutamatergic overactivity constitutes a promising neuroprotective strategy. Especially the new antagonists of the NMDA-receptors with high affinity to the NR2B subunit of the receptor are in focus of our interest, since they reveal a favourable profile of side effects, therefore providing a promising tool for neuroprotection.</AbstractText>"}

However, the precise mechanism by which this occurs remains unknown. Herein we demonstrate that BM-MSCs are able to promote neuronal networks with functional synaptic transmission after transplantation into Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) mouse cerebellum. To address the mechanism by which this occurs, we used gene microarray, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate expression of neurotransmitter receptors on Purkinje neurons in the NP-C cerebellum. Gene microarray analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission encoding subunits of the ionotropic glutamate receptors (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, AMPA) GluR4 and GABA(A) receptor beta2. We also demonstrated that BM-MSCs, when originated by fusion-like events with existing Purkinje neurons, develop into electrically active Purkinje neurons with functional synaptic formation. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that upregulation of neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to synapse formation via cell fusion-like processes after BM-MSC transplantation into mice with neurodegenerative disease. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we investigated the regulation of AR phosphorylation in order to understand factors that may modify SBMA disease progression. We show that expanded polyglutamine AR is phosphorylated by Akt. Substitution of the AR at two Akt consensus sites, S215 and S792, with aspartate, which mimics phosphorylation, reduces ligand binding, ligand-dependent nuclear translocation, transcriptional activation and toxicity of expanded polyglutamine AR. Co-expression of constitutively active Akt and the AR has similar consequences, which are blocked by alanine substitutions at residues 215 and 792. Furthermore, in motor neuron-derived MN-1 cells toxicity associated with polyglutamine-expanded AR is rescued by co-expression with Akt. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulation, which activates several cell survival promoting pathways, also reduces toxicity of the expanded polyglutamine AR in MN-1 cells, in a manner dependent upon phospho-inositol-3-kinase. IGF-1 rescue of AR toxicity is diminished by alanine substitutions at the Akt consensus sites. These results highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention in SBMA.</AbstractText>"}

Axons and synapses are protected from degeneration by the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(s)) gene. Significantly the molecular mechanisms through which this spontaneous genetic mutation delays degeneration remain controversial, and the downstream protein targets of Wld(s) resident in non-somatic compartments remain unknown. In this study we used differential proteomics analysis to identify proteins whose expression levels were significantly altered in isolated synaptic preparations from the striatum of Wld(s) mice. Eight of the 16 proteins we identified as having modified expression levels in Wld(s) synapses are known regulators of mitochondrial stability and degeneration (including VDAC1, Aralar1, and mitofilin). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that other key mitochondrial proteins, not identified in our initial screen, are also modified in Wld(s) synapses. Of the non-mitochondrial proteins identified, several have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases where synapses and axons are primary pathological targets (including DRP-2 and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta). In addition, we show that downstream protein changes can be identified in pathways corresponding to both Ube4b (including UBE1) and Nmnat1 (including VDAC1 and Aralar1) components of the chimeric Wld(s) gene, suggesting that full-length Wld(s) protein is required to elicit maximal changes in synaptic proteins. We conclude that altered mitochondrial responses to degenerative stimuli are likely to play an important role in the neuroprotective Wld(s) phenotype and that targeting proteins identified in the current study may lead to novel therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.</AbstractText>"}

The relatively long asymptomatic latency of vCJD, as well as the lack of sensitive and specific antemortem tests, increase the risk that asymptomatic, infected individuals may become blood donors. To this point, donor deferral has been a strategy used to reduce this risk. Nevertheless, this strategy may be unreliable and, furthermore, may threaten blood availability. Leukoreduction has also been helpful in reducing cell-associated infectious prion, which has been reported to reduce up to 42% of the infectivity in blood. Proprietary prion affinity surface modifications have been developed and applied to filters, which exploit an understanding of the unique chemical characteristics of prion surfaces. These have been successfully adapted to existing high-efficiency blood filter matrices for the reduction of prions present in blood components for transfusion.</AbstractText>"}

Are complex care patients the same as complex patients? The insertion of the word care may make a difference: You decide. There are complex patients who challenge us technically and intellectually, and then there are those who require even more from us--they challenge us technically, intellectually, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

There is currently no treatment that can prevent the striatal neuropathology. Transglutaminase (TG) activity is increased in HD patients, is associated with cell death, and has been suggested to contribute to striatal neuronal loss in HD. This work assesses the therapeutic potential of cystamine, an inhibitor of TG activity with additional potentially beneficial effects. Specifically, we examine the effect of cystamine on striatal neuronal loss in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We demonstrate here for the first time that YAC128 mice show a forebrain-specific increase in TG activity compared with wild-type (WT) littermates which is decreased by oral delivery of cystamine. Treatment of symptomatic YAC128 mice with cystamine starting at 7 months prevented striatal neuronal loss. Cystamine treatment also ameliorated the striatal volume loss and striatal neuronal atrophy observed in these animals, but was unable to prevent motor dysfunction or the down-regulation of dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophsophate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) expression in the striatum. While the exact mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of cystamine in YAC128 mice is uncertain, our findings suggest that cystamine is neuroprotective and may be beneficial in the treatment of HD.</AbstractText>"}

Acute and chronic treatment with M30 results in increased levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin(5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and decreases in DOPAC (dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), HVA (homovanillic acid) and 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) as determined in striatum and hypothalamus. In the mouse MPTP (N-methy-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model of Parkinson's disease (PD) it attenuates the DA depleting action of the neurotoxin and increases striatal levels of DA, 5-HT and NA, while decreasing their metabolites.

We have now considered the effects of P and its derivatives on these and other myelin proteins [i.e., myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL)] in sex-specific cultures of rat Schwann cells. Gene expression of myelin proteins was assessed by RNase protection assay. Treatment with P or DHP induced a stimulatory effect on P0 mRNA levels in male but not in female Schwann cells. In contrast, treatment with THP increased gene expression of P0 exclusively in female Schwann cells. A similar sex-difference was also evident for other myelin proteins. Indeed, PMP22 expression was stimulated by treatment with P in male cultures, whereas THP induced an increase of mRNA levels in female cultures. Moreover, MAG was stimulated by THP treatment in male cultures only, whereas MAL expression was unaffected by neuroactive steroid treatment in both male and female cultures.

Also, it plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Recently, mitochondria have emerged as being pivotal in controlling apoptosis. They house a number of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c, which are released into the cytoplasm at the onset of apoptosis. When rat brain mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, interacts with Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and tBid, its pore size increases, leading to the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic molecules into the cytosol and causing cell death. Regulation of this tBid- and Bax-induced increase in pore size of VDAC is a significant step to control cell death induced by cytochrome c. In this work, we have shown, through bilayer electrophysiological experiments, that the increase in VDAC conductance as a result of its interaction with Bax and tBid is reduced because of the action of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in the presence of ATP. This indicates that the increase in the pore size of VDAC after its interaction with Bax and tBid is controlled via phosphorylation of this channel by PKA. This, we believe, could be a mechanism of controlling cytochrome c-mediated cell death in living cells.</AbstractText>"}

Using cell based models we investigated the potential of the prion protein to protect against copper toxicity. Although prion protein expression effectively protected neurones from copper toxicity, this protection was not necessarily associated with reduction in oxidative damage. We also showed that glycine and the prion protein could both protect neuronal cells from oxidative stress. Only the prion protein could protect these cells from the toxicity of copper. In contrast glycine increased copper toxicity without any apparent oxidative stress or lipid peroxidation. Mutational analysis showed that protection by the prion protein was dependent upon the copper binding octameric repeat region. Our findings demonstrate that copper toxicity can be independent of measured oxidative stress and that prion protein expression primarily protects against copper toxicity independently of the mechanism of cell death.</AbstractText>"}

We show that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with H2O2 up-regulates survival pathways during early stages of apoptosis. Subsequently, the decline of anti-apoptotic protein levels leads to the activation of the calcium-dependent proteases calpains and the cysteine proteases caspases. Additionally, we demonstrate that CR-6 (3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-1(2H)-benzopyran) acts as a scavenger of ROS and prevents apoptosis by enhancing and prolonging up-regulation of survival pathways.

In searching for novel antioxidant iron chelators with potential MAO-B inhibitory activity, a series of new iron chelators has been designed, synthesized and investigated. In this study, the novel chelators were further examined for their activity as antioxidants, MAO-B inhibitors and neuroprotective agents in vitro. Three of the selected chelators (M30, HLA20 and M32) were the most effective in inhibiting iron-dependent lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates with IC50 values (12-16 microM), which is comparable with that of desferal, a prototype iron chelator that is not has orally active. Their antioxidant activities were further confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In PC12 cell culture, the three novel chelators at 0.1 microM were able to attenuate cell death induced by serum deprivation and by 6-hydroxydopamine. M30 possessing propargyl, the MAO inhibitory moiety of the anti-Parkinson drug rasagiline, displayed greater neuroprotective potency than that of rasagiline. In addition, in vitro, M30 was a highly potent non-selective MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitor (IC50 &lt; 0.1 microM).

This protection was blocked by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of either the MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. The importance of these pathways was further confirmed by the activation of both ERK, in a MEK-dependent manner, and Akt, via PI3K. Activation of Akt increased the binding of the p50 and p65 subunits of NFkappaB, which was also important for neuroprotection. Akt inhibition prevented NFkappaB binding, suggesting a role for Akt in SCF-induced NFkappaB. Pharmacological inhibition of NFkappaB or dominant negative IkappaB also prevented neuroprotection by SCF. SCF up-regulated the anti-apoptotic genes, bcl-2 and bcl-xL in an NFkappaB-dependent manner.

The protective effects of estrogens take place partly through pathways involving canonical ER activation, which is constitutively expressed in many brain regions and is able to initiate gene transcription after specifically binding to estradiol. In addition, non-genomic (or alternative) signalling pathways, involving extranuclear ERs, respond to physiological concentration of estrogens to elicit neuroprotection. Often, rapid activation of intracellular signallers such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) underlie alternative estrogen-induced neuroprotection upon activation of specific binding sites at the plasma membrane. Although the molecular characteristics of these unconventional ERs are still largely unknown, the generally held view maintains that plasma membrane ER (mER) originates from, or is related to, classical nuclear ERs. The present article will review some of the most recent evidence revealing the relevance of alternative mechanisms in estrogen-dependent neuroprotection.

KYN is formed in the mammalian brain (40%) and is taken up from the periphery (60%), indicating that it can be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the brain, KYN can be converted to two other components of the pathway: the neurotoxic quinolinic acid (QUIN) and the neuroprotective kynurenic acid (KYNA). QUIN is probably the most widely studied metabolite of KYN, because it may cause excitotoxic neuronal cell loss and convulsions by interacting with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, a type of glutamate receptor. KYNA is another metabolite of KYN; its synthesis is catalysed by KYN aminotransferases. This is the only known endogenous NMDA receptor inhibitor, which can act at the glycine site on the receptor complex. Furthermore, KYNA non-competitively inhibits alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine presynaptic receptors (nAChRs), inhibiting glutamate release, and regulates the expression of alpha4beta2 nAChR. It is well-known that the activation of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors can play a role in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke and epilepsy. Various studies have been made of whether the EAA receptor antagonist KYNA can exert a therapeutic effect in these neurological disorders. It has been established that KYNA has only a very limited ability to cross the BBB. Other KYNA derivatives have been synthesised (e.g. glucosamine-KYNA, 4-chloro-KYNA and 7-chloro-KYNA), which are well transported across the BBB and act on the glutamate receptors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that probenecid, a known inhibitor of the transport of organic acids (e.g. KYNA), increases the cerebral concentration of KYNA. There is another new perspective to the maintenance of a high level of KYNA in the brain: the use of enzyme inhibitors, which can block the synthesis of the neurotoxic QUIN. These are some of the most promising possibilities as novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, in which the hyperactivation of amino acid receptors could be involved. The presence and importance of KYN derivatives in the periphery are also discussed in the light of recent publications.</AbstractText>"}

According to the current interpretation of ideational apraxia [De Renzi, E., &amp; Lucchelli, F. (1988). Ideational apraxia.

The results are discussed within a 'multimodal model' of semantic memory in which the concept of action is seen as the product of the integration between sensorial and motor attributes. We suggest that corticobasal degeneration might offer a unique opportunity to validate this model because it is typically characterized by a frontoparietal damage [Gibb, W. R., Luthert, P.

The best evidence for neuronal dysfunction is the observation that gene expression is altered in HD brain, suggesting that transcriptional dysregulation is a central mechanism. Studies of altered gene expression began with careful observations of postmortem human HD brain and subsequently were accelerated by the development of transgenic mouse models. The application of DNA microarray technology has spurred tremendous progress with respect to the altered transcriptional processes that occur in HD, through gene expression studies of both transgenic mouse models as well as cellular models of HD. Gene expression profiles are remarkably comparable across these models, bolstering the idea that transcriptional signatures reflect an essential feature of disease pathogenesis. Finally, gene expression studies have been applied to human HD, thus not only validating the approach of using model systems, but also solidifying the idea that altered transcription is a key mechanism in HD pathogenesis. In the future, gene expression profiling will be used as a readout in clinical trials aimed at correcting transcriptional dysregulation in Huntington's disease.</AbstractText>"}

The effect was specific as in addition to Akt, the activation of MAPK/ERK, but not PLC gamma, was decreased. Activation of CREB, a target of these signaling pathways, was severely depressed by IL-1 beta. As the cytokine did not influence TrkB receptor and PLC gamma activation, IL-1 beta might have interfered with BDNF signaling at the docking step conveying activation to the PI3-K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways. Indeed, IL-1 beta suppressed the activation of the respective scaffolding proteins IRS-1 and Shc; this effect might involve ceramide generation. IL-1-induced interference with BDNF neuroprotection and signal transduction was corrected, in part, by ceramide production inhibitors and mimicked by the cell-permeable C2-ceramide. These results suggest that IL-1 beta places neurons at risk by interfering with BDNF signaling involving a ceramide-associated mechanism.</AbstractText>"}

In particular, unfolded or misfolded proteins resulting from environmental stresses or free radicals are rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical gas, has been reported to be involved in such processes as vasorelaxation and neurotransmission. Conversely, NO also is implicated in neuronal cell death or neurodegeneration. Recent reports suggest that S-nitrosylation of proteins is a significant cause of neural dysfunction leading to neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, S-nitrosylation of parkin eventually leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and subsequent neuronal death. The focus of this review is the identity of the target of NO. Nitrosative stress prevents normal functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via S-nitrosylation of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is located in the ER lumen. This may contribute to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, as well as sustained activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. These phenomena may be linked to the development of sporadic neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The pathogenesis of PD remains incompletely understood. Environmental factors, oxidative damage, misfolded protein aggregates, ubiquitin-proteasome system impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction might all be involved. Recent studies point to activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated cell death linked to PD. Accumulation of unfolded and/or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen induces ER stress. To withstand such potentially lethal conditions, intracellular signaling pathways collectively termed the unfolded protein responses (UPR) are activated. The UPR include translational attenuation, induction of ER resident chaperones, and degradation of misfolded proteins through the ER-associated degradation. In case of severe and/or prolonged ER stress, cellular signals leading to cell death are activated. Accumulating evidence suggests that ER stress induced by aberrant protein degradation is implicated in PD. Here the authors review the emerging role of ER stress in PD and related disorders, and highlight current knowledge in this field that may reveal novel insight into disease mechanisms and help to provide novel avenues to potential therapies.</AbstractText>"}

Owing to their extended morphology, with axons in humans exceeding a meter in length, in addition to which they are not renewed but persist for the entire lifespan, it is no surprise that neurons are highly vulnerable to any perturbation of their sophisticated transport machinery. There is emerging evidence that impaired transport is not only causative for a range of motor disorders, but possibly also for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. Support for this hypothesis comes from transgenic animal models. Overexpression of human tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in mice and flies models the key hallmark histopathological characteristics of AD, such as somatodendritic accumulation of phosphorylated forms of tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide-containing amyloid plaques, as well as axonopathy. The latter has also been demonstrated in mutant mice with altered levels of Alzheimer-associated genes, such as presenilin (PS). In Abeta-producing APP transgenic mice, axonopathy was observed before the onset of plaque formation and tau hyperphosphorylation. In human AD brain, an axonopathy was revealed for early but not late Braak stages. The overall picture is that key players in AD, such as tau, APP and PS, perturb axonal transport early on in AD, causing impaired synaptic plasticity and reducing survival rates. It will be challenging to determine the molecular mechanisms of these different axonopathies, as this might assist in the development of new therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>"}

To gain a better understanding of the precise role of calsenilin in specific cellular compartments, an interactor hunt for proteins that bind to the N-terminal domain of calsenilin was carried out. Using a yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we have identified the transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)2 as an interactor for calsenilin and have shown that the two proteins can interact in vivo. In co-immunoprecipitation studies, calsenilin also interacted with CtBP1, a CtBP2 homolog. Our data also showed a calsenilin-dependent increase in c-fos protein levels in CtBP knockout fibroblasts, suggesting that CtBP may modulate the transcriptional repression of c-fos by calsenilin. Furthermore, the finding that histone deacetylase protein and activity were associated with the calsenilin-CtBP immunocomplex suggests a mechanism by which calsenilin-CtBP may act to repress transcription.

The mainstream treatment has been dopaminergic replacement therapy aimed at symptomatic relief, with the gold standard drug being the dopamine precursor levodopa. The general dogma has been that levodopa works primarily by indirectly activating the D(2) family of dopamine receptors. Recently, a number of direct dopamine agonists that target the D(2) and D(3) dopamine receptors have been used as dopaminergic replacement strategies. Although these direct D(2) and D(3) drugs cause only modest improvement in motor function compared to levodopa, they can delay the initiation of levodopa and can act synergistically with levodopa. In addition, they can delay the onset of levodopa-related motor complications. Recent imaging data also suggest that they may have neuroprotective effects. Whereas D(2)/D(3) agonists have received much attention as several drugs are available for clinical trials and usage, there has been a large body of data showing that the D(1) receptor actually may play a larger role in restoration of normal motor function. This review examines the current use of dopamine D(2)/D(3) agonists in treatment of PD and their potential for providing neuroprotection.

Stem cells contribute to cellular plasticity during the lifespan, and in some sense, brain development never ends. However, neurodegeneration is not just a lack of neuroregeneration, and cell genesis in the adult brain does not apparently lead to successful endogenous responses to neurodegeneration. The brain heals poorly; nevertheless, the onset, severity and progression of neurodegenerative disorders show large variation and can often be influenced by cognitive training and physical activity. Rather than providing endogenous repair, cellular plasticity, including adult neurogenesis might thus contribute to the 'cognitive reserve' that determines how well an organism can compensate for neurodegeneration. From this perspective, neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lewy body and Huntington's diseases, might share a relevant biological principle that even links them to psychiatric disorders, like depression, which are not considered 'neurodegenerative' in a classical sense. However, the integration of neuroregenerative phenomena and most notably adult neurogenesis into the concepts of neurodegeneration is not without problems and remains speculative at present. Adult neurogenesis might be part of the physiological regenerative response and might thereby alter or alleviate symptoms, but it might also become impaired by the disease mechanism and thereby contribute to the symptoms of neurodegeneration. In any case, the extent to which effects on the level of cellular plasticity, be it degenerative or regenerative, are relevant functionally remains to be determined. The present review gives an overview of what is known about cell genesis and adult neurogenesis in neurodegenerative disorders and discusses how cellular plasticity might be part of concepts that integrate aspects of development and cellular plasticity into neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Traditionally, MS has been considered a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the central white matter in which ensuing demyelination results in physical disability [Frohman EM, Racke MK, Raine CS (2006) N Engl J Med 354:942-955]. More recently, MS has become increasingly viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder in which neuronal loss, axonal injury, and atrophy of the CNS lead to permanent neurological and clinical disability. Although axonal pathology and loss in MS has been recognized for &gt;100 years, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Progressive axonal loss in MS may stem from a cascade of ionic imbalances initiated by inflammation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic deficits that result in mitochondrial and cellular Ca2+ overload. In a murine disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice lacking cyclophilin D (CyPD), a key regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), developed EAE, but unlike WT mice, they partially recovered. Examination of the spinal cords of CyPD-knockout mice revealed a striking preservation of axons, despite a similar extent of inflammation. Furthermore, neurons prepared from CyPD-knockout animals were resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species thought to mediate axonal damage in EAE and MS, and brain mitochondria lacking CyPD sequestered substantially higher levels of Ca2+. Our results directly implicate pathological activation of the mitochondrial PTP in the axonal damage occurring during MS and identify CyPD, as well as the PTP, as a potential target for MS neuroprotective therapies.</AbstractText>"}

LH has been implicated in key cellular and biochemical processes that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. These processes include the altered metabolism of key proteins in AD pathology, beta amyloid (Abeta), and its parent molecule, the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

AMPAR potentiators slow channel deactivation and desensitization, and these compounds represent exciting therapies for mental and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies showed that the AMPAR potentiators cyclothiazide and 4-[2-(phenylsulfonylamino)ethylthio]-2,6-difluorophenoxyacetamide display a preference for flip and flop alternatively spliced versions of glutamate receptor subunits, respectively.

A mitochondrial dysfunction causes an abatement in ATP production, oxidative damage and the induction of apoptosis, all of which are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous disorders. This review focuses on mitochondrial dysfunctions and discusses their consequences and potential roles in the pathomechanism of neurodegenerative disorders. Other pathogenetic factors are also briefly surveyed. The second part of the review deals with the kynurenine metabolic pathway, its alterations and their potential association with cellular energy impairment in certain neurodegenerative diseases. During energy production, most of the O(2) consumed by the mitochondria is reduced fully to water, but 1-2% of the O(2) is reduced incompletely to give the superoxide anion (O(2)(-)). If the function of one or more respiratory chain complexes is impaired for any reason, the enhanced production of free radicals further worsens the mitochondrial function by causing oxidative damage to macromolecules, and by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pores thereby inducing apoptosis. These high-conductance pores offer a pathway which can open in response to certain stimuli, leading to the induction of the cells' own suicide program. This program plays an essential role in regulating growth and development, in the differentiation of immune cells, and in the elimination of abnormal cells from the organism. Both failure and exaggeration of apoptosis in a human body can lead to disease. The increasing amount of superoxide anions can react with nitric oxide to yield the highly toxic peroxynitrite anion, which can destroy cellular macromolecules. The roles of oxidative, nitrative and nitrosative damage are discussed. Senescence is accompanied by a higher degree of reactive oxygen species production, and by diminished functions of the endoplasmic reticulum and the proteasome system, which are responsible for maintenance of the normal protein homeostasis of the cell. In the event of a dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum, unfolded proteins aggregate in it, forming potentially toxic deposits which tend to be resistant to degradation. Cells possess adaptive mechanisms with which to avoid the accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins. These involve molecular chaperones that fold proteins correctly, and the ubiquitin proteasome system which degrades misfolded, unwanted proteins. Both the endoplasmic reticulum and the ubiquitin proteasome system fulfill cellular protein quality control functions. The kynurenine system: Tryptophan is metabolized via several pathways, the main one being the kynurenine pathway. A central compound of the pathway is kynurenine (KYN), which can be metabolized in two separate ways: one branch furnishing kynurenic acid, and the other 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid, the precursors of NAD. An important feature of kynurenic acid is the fact that it is one of the few known endogenous excitatory amino acid receptor blockers with a broad spectrum of antagonistic properties in supraphysiological concentrations. One of its recently confirmed sites of action is the alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and interestingly, a more recently identified one is a higher affinity positive modulatory binding site at the AMPA receptor. Kynurenic acid has proven to be neuroprotective in several experimental settings. On the other hand, quinolinic acid is a specific agonist at the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and a potent neurotoxin with an additional and marked free radical-producing property. There are a number of neurodegenerative disorders whose pathogenesis has been demonstrated to involve multiple imbalances of the kynurenine pathway metabolism. These changes may disturb normal brain function and can add to the pathomechanisms of the diseases. In certain disorders, there is a quinolinic acid overproduction, while in others the alterations in brain kynurenic acid levels are more pronounced. A more precise knowledge of these alterations yields a basis for getting better therapeutic possibilities. The last part of the review discusses metabolic disturbances and changes in the kynurenine metabolic pathway in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Our results indicate that, whereas the ratio between the two CoQ homologues present in mice (CoQ(9) and CoQ(10)) is not altered by prion infection during the course of the disease, significant increases in total CoQ(9) and CoQ(10) were observed in BSE-infected mice 150 days after inoculation.

Because antisense oligonucleotides are readily internalized by neuronal cells in culture, these compounds could possibly serve as novel therapeutic agents to meet such a challenge. In previous in vitro work using cell culture systems, we have demonstrated that intracellular delivery requires a vector such as cationic liposomes since free oligonucleotides remain largely trapped in the endocytic pathway following cellular uptake. Here we studied the cellular uptake properties of oligonucleotides by explants of rat brain (brain slices), and by in vivo brain tissue after administration of oligonucleotides by bolus injection. In contrast to in vitro uptake, we show that in brain slices oligonucleotides were taken up by neuronal and nonneuronal cells, irrespective of their assembly with cationic liposomes. In either case, a diffuse distribution of oligonucleotides was seen in the cytosol and/or nucleus. Uptake of oligonucleotides by brain slices as a result of membrane damage, potentially arising from the isolation procedure, could be excluded. Interestingly, internalization was inhibited following treatment of the tissue with antibody GN-2640, directed against a nucleic acid channel, present in rat kidney cells. Our data support the view that an analogous channel is present in brain tissue, allowing entry of free oligonucleotides but not plasmids. Indeed, for delivery of the latter and accomplishment of effective transfection, cationic lipids were needed for gene translocation into both brain slices and brain tissue in vivo. These data imply that for antisense therapy to become effective in brain, cationic lipid-mediated delivery will only be needed for specific cell targeting but not necessarily for delivery per se to accomplish nuclear deposition of oligonucleotides into brain cells and subsequent down-regulation of disease-related targets.</AbstractText>"}

To reveal whether the transgenic GluR-B(N) expression aggravates the course of motoneuron disease in SOD1 mice, we mated heterozygous GluR-B(N) and SOD1 [C57BL6Ico-TgN(hSOD1-G93A)1Gur] mice to generate double-transgenic progeny. The phenotypic sequelae in mice carrying mutations were evaluated by monitoring growth, motor coordination, and survival. Neuronal degeneration was assessed by morphological and stereological analysis of spinal cord and brain. We found that transgenic expression in mice of GluR-B(N)-containing glutamate AMPA receptors with increased Ca2+ permeability leads to a late-onset degeneration of neurons in the spinal cord and decline of motor functions. Neuronal death progressed over the entire life span, but manifested clinically in late adulthood, resembling the course of a slow neurodegenerative disorder. Additional transgenic expression of mutated human SOD1 accelerated disease progression, aggravated severity of motor decline, and decreased survival.

PSAP has several neuronal effects, including neurite outgrowth stimulation, neuron preservation, and nerve regeneration enhancement. A minimal domain required for PSAP's neurotrophic function is located in the amino-terminal half of saposin C. Genetic defects of the PSAP gene in humans and mice lead to a complex lysosomal storage disease. The skin fibroblasts from PSAP- and saposin C-deficient patients have a massive accumulation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Incorporation of exogenous saposin C-containing liposomes into the cultured PSAP-/- cells reduced the accumulated MVBs to normal levels. Internalized saposin C was localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. MVBs are crucial for maintaining the cellular homeostasis required for neuronal development and growth. PSAP-/- mice have a short life span (30 days) and central nervous system (CNS) neuronal degeneration. Similar to PSAP-/- fibroblasts, excessive MVBs accumulated in CNS neurons and brain tissues of PSAP-null mice. Cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons from PSAP-/- mice had poor survival and displayed a neurite degenerative pattern. Delivery of saposin C ex vivo into cultured neurons and in vivo into brain neuronal cells in mice across the blood-brain barrier was accomplished with intravenously administered dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) liposomes.

Emerging evidence supports the notion that both mood stabilizers have neuroprotective effects. In primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons, lithium and valproate robustly and potently protect against glutamate-induced, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. The neuroprotective mechanisms involve inactivation of NMDA receptors through inhibition of NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of cell survival factors such as the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, and induction of neurotrophic/neuroprotective proteins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, heat-shock protein (HSP), and Bcl-2. Both drugs are also effective against other forms of insults such as ER stress in neurally related cell types. The molecular targets likely involve glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) for lithium and valproate, respectively. In a rat cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke, postinsult treatment with lithium or valproate reduces ischemia-induced brain infarction, caspase-3 activation, and neurological deficits, and these neuroprotective effects are associated with HSP70 upregulation and, in the case of valproate, HDAC inhibition. In a rat excitotoxic model of Huntington's disease in which an excitotoxin is infused into the striatum to activate NMDA receptors, short-term lithium pretreatment is sufficient to protect against DNA damage, caspase activation, and apoptosis of striatal neurons, and this neuroprotection is concurrent with Bcl-2 induction. Moreover, lithium treatment increases cell proliferation near the site of striatal injury, and some newborn cells have phenotypes of neurons and astroglia. Thus, lithium and valproate are potential drugs for treating some forms of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Neural dysfunction and metabolic imbalances underlie many diseases, and the inclusion of metabolic modifiers may provide an alternative and early intervention approach that may prevent further damage. Various models have been developed to study the impact of metabolism on brain function. These have also proven useful in expanding our understanding of neurodegeneration processes. For example, the metabolic compromise induced by inhibitors such as 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), rotenone, and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) can cause neurodegeneration in animal models and these models are thought to simulate the processes that may lead to diseases such as Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases. These inhibitors of metabolism are thought to selectively kill neurons by inhibiting various mitochondrial enzymes. However, the eventual cell death is attributed to oxidative stress damage of selectively vulnerable cells, especially highly differentiated neurons. Various studies indicate that the neurotoxicity resulting from these types of metabolic compromise is related to mitochondrial dysfunction and may be ameliorated by metabolic modifiers such as L-carnitine (L-C), creatine, and coenzyme Q10, as well as by antioxidants such as lipoic acid, vitamin E, and resveratrol. Mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism are also affected by the dietary intake of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which may regulate membrane composition and influence cellular processes, especially the inflammatory pathways. Cellular metabolic function may also be ameliorated by caloric restriction diets. L-C is a naturally occurring quaternary ammonium compound that is a vital cofactor for the mitochondrial entry and oxidation of fatty acids. Any factors affecting L-C levels may also affect ATP levels. This endogenous compound, L-C, together with its acetyl ester, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), also participates in the control of the mitochondrial acyl-CoA/CoA ratio, peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids, and production of ketone bodies. A deficiency of carnitine is known to have major deleterious effects on the CNS. We have examined L-C and its acetylated derivative, ALC, as potential neuroprotective compounds using various known metabolic inhibitors, as well as against drugs of abuse such as methamphetamine.</AbstractText>"}

Evidence suggests that oxidative stresses are involved in the mechanism of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis. Exposure to Abeta increases lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and the formation of hydrogen peroxide in cultured cells. Nitric oxide (NO) has significant physiological roles in the central nervous system and also it can be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases because of its free radical properties. The purpose of this study is to search the effects of intrahippocampal Abeta (1-42) injection on malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and nitrite plus nitrate (NOx) levels in temporal cortex and basal forebrain in rats. In this study, male adult Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups. Abeta (1-42) peptide (10 mug/2 muL) was administered bilaterally as a single injection into the hippocampal fissure by a Hamilton microsyringe. Distilled water was administered to the control group by using the same procedure. Ten days after the Abeta (1-42) injection, the rats were decapitated and brains were rapidly removed. MDA, GSH, and NOx levels were analyzed spectrophotometrically in temporal cortex and basal forebrain. MDA levels and NOx were increased 10 days after the injection of Abeta (1-42) in temporal cortex and basal forebrain, but no statistical significance was found compared to control group. However, GSH levels were significantly higher in temporal cortex and basal forebrain in the Abeta (1-42)-injected group than the control group (P &lt; 0.05).

It is likely that, in cases of severe deficits in memory or motor function, hospitalization and/or custodial care would be a likely outcome. This means that unless some way is found to reduce these age-related decrements in neuronal function, healthcare costs will continue to rise exponentially. Thus, it is extremely important to explore methods to retard or reverse the age-related neuronal deficits as well as their subsequent, behavioral manifestations. Applying molecular biological approaches to slow aging in the human condition may be years away. So it is important to determine what methods can be used today to increase healthy aging, forestall the onset of these diseases, and create conditions favorable to obtaining a 'longevity dividend' in both financial and human terms. In this regard, epidemiological studies indicate that consumption of diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, may lower the risk of developing age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD). Research suggests that the polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, such as blueberries, may exert their beneficial effects by altering stress signaling and neuronal communication, suggesting that interventions may exert protection against age-related deficits in cognitive and motor function. The purpose of this article is to discuss the benefits of these interventions in rodent models and to describe the putative molecular mechanisms involved in their benefits.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of the present postmortem study was to examine HLA class II (HLA-DR) expression on microglia in brain regions which are particularly relevant for schizophrenia, with regard to hemispheric lateralization. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) were studied in 16 cases with schizophrenia and 16 control subjects. Immunostaining was found in all brain regions and was not restricted to macrophage-like ameboid cells, but also appeared in ramified cells. Region-specific HLA-DR-positive cell density was not significantly different between cases with schizophrenia and controls. However, ameboid microglial cells were lateralized towards the right hemisphere in healthy subjects but not in the schizophrenia group (P=0.01). Postmortem interval correlated with ramified cell numbers in ACC/DLPFC (P=0.01/0.04) and ameboid cell density in hippocampus (P=0.03). Age, gender, duration of disease, medication dosage, storage delay and whole brain volume had no effect. Single case analysis revealed highly elevated microglial cell numbers in ACC and MD of two schizophrenic patients who had committed suicide during acute psychosis.

TPP-I deficiency is associated with late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a fatal neurodegenerative disease of childhood that is characterized by loss of neurons and photoreceptor cells. We have developed two novel fluorogenic substrates, [Ala-Ala-Phe]2-rhodamine 110 and [Arg-Nle-Nle]2-rhodamine 110, that are cleaved by TPP-I in living cells. Fluorescence of liberated rhodamine 110 was detected by flow cytometry and was dependent on the level of TPP-I expression. Rhodamine-related fluorescence could be suppressed by preincubation with a specific inhibitor of TPP-I. When investigated by fluorescent confocal microscopy, rhodamine signals colocalized with lysosomal markers. Thus, cleavage of these rhodamide-derived substrates is a marker for mature enzymatically active TPP-I. In addition, TPP-I-induced cleavage of [Ala-Ala-Phe]2-rhodamine 110 could be visualized in primary neurons. We conclude that [Ala-Ala-Phe]2-rhodamine 110 and [Arg-Nle-Nle]2-rhodamine 110 are specific substrates for determining TPP-I activity and intracellular localization in living cells.

These silent mutations are predicted to destabilize a stem loop structure at the exon 10 5'-splice site; however, the existence of this stem loop under physiological conditions and its role in splice regulation are controversial. Here we show that base changes that stabilize this stem loop in vitro substantially decrease exon 10 inclusion in a wild type tau minigene and rescue the increase in exon 10 splicing caused by a dementia-causing point mutation. Moreover, we probed the intracellular structure of the tau stem loop with antisense RNA and demonstrate that the stability of the stem loop dictates antisense effectiveness.

We hypothesized that phosphorylation of Htt may modulate cleavage and cytotoxicity. In the present study, we have mapped the major phosphorylation sites of Htt using cell culture models (293T and PC12 cells) expressing full-length myc-tagged Htt constructs containing 23Q or 148Q repeats. Purified myc-tagged Htt was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and nano-HPLC tandem mass spectrometry, used in conjunction with on-target alkaline phosphatase and protease digestions. We have identified more than six novel serine phosphorylation sites within Htt, one of which lies in the proteolytic susceptibility domain. Three of the sites have the consensus sequence for ERK1 phosphorylation, and addition of ERK1 inhibitor blocks phosphorylation at those sites.

Lipid messengers modulate signaling cascades, contributing to development, differentiation, function (e.g., memory), protection, regeneration, and repair of neurons and overall regulation of neuronal, glial, and endothelial cell functional integrity. Oxidative stress disrupts lipid signaling and promotes lipid peroxidation and neurodegeneration. Lipid signaling at the neurovascular unit (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and cells of the microvasculature) is altered in early cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease. We discuss how lipid signaling regulates critical events in neuronal survival. Aberrant synaptic plasticity (e.g., epileptogenesis) is highlighted to show how gene expression may drive synaptic circuitry formation in the 'wrong' direction. Docosahexaenoic acid has been implicated in memory, photoreceptor cell biogenesis and function, and neuroprotection. Free docosahexaenoic acid released in the brain during experimental stroke leads to the synthesis of stereospecific messengers through oxygenation pathways. One messenger, 10,17S-docosatriene (neuroprotectin D1; NPD1), counteracts leukocyte infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression in brain ischemia-reperfusion. In retina, photoreceptor survival depends on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell integrity. NPD1 is synthesized in RPE cells undergoing oxidative stress, potently counteracts oxidative stress-triggered apoptotic DNA damage in RPE, upregulates antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), and decreases proapoptotic Bax and Bad expression.

Metabotropic group I glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation by their selective agonist, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), resulted in concentration-dependent reduction of nerve cell susceptibility to NMDA-mediated injury (neuroprotective effect). The neuroprotection was mediated primarily by mGluR1, required phospholipase C activation, was inhibited by cholesterol-containing methyl-beta-cyclodextrin treatment, and occluded by antipsychotic quetiapine. It was associated with suppression of NMDA currents and prolongation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents in DHPG-treated cultures. cDNA microarray analysis of 1128 brain-relevant genes revealed that mGluR-mediated neuroprotection was associated with simultaneous activation of endocytosis, and inactivation of inflammation, cell adhesion, cell death, and transcription-related genes. Antisense inhibition of Rab5b, a gene coding for a small GTPase associated with endocytosis, significantly reduced the mGluR-mediated neuroprotection.

A key component of this natural response is the production of inflammatory mediators by resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages. There is accumulating evidence that inflammation contributes to acute injuries and more chronic CNS diseases, though other studies have shown that inhibition of microglia is, in contrast, associated with more damages or less repair. The controversies regarding the neuroprotective and neurodegenerative properties of microglia may depend on the experimental approaches. Neurotoxic substances are frequently used to produce animal models of acute injuries or diseases and they may activate microglia either directly or indirectly by their ability to cause neuronal death and demyelination. Whether microglia and the immune response play a direct role in such processes still remains an open question. On the other hand, there are data supporting the role of resident microglia and those derived from the bone marrow in the stimulation of myelin repair, removal of toxic proteins from the CNS and the prevention of neurodegeneration in chronic brain diseases. The ability of glucocorticoids to provide a negative feedback on nuclear factor kappa B pathways in microglia may be a determinant mechanism underlying the ultimate fate of the inflammatory response in the CNS. This review presents new concepts regarding the neuroprotective role of the innate immune response in the brain and how microglia can be directed to improve recovery after injuries and prevent/delay neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Among them, A beta 3(pE)-42 peptide, starting with pyroglutamyl at residue Glu-3, is considered as the predominant A beta species in AD plaques and pre-amyloid lesions. Its abundance is reported to be directly proportional to the severity of the clinical phenotype. The present study investigates the effects of soluble oligomeric A beta 3(pE)-42 after intracerebroventricular injection on mice learning ability and the molecular mechanisms of its in vitro neurotoxicity. Mice injected with soluble A beta 3(pE)-42 or A beta(l-42) displayed impaired spatial working memory and delayed memory acquisition in Y-maze and Morris water maze tests, while those injected with soluble A beta(42-1) showed no effect. These cognitive alterations were associated with free radical overproduction in the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs, but not in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. In vitro, A beta 3(pE)-42 oligomers induced a redox-sensitive neuronal apoptosis involving caspase activation and an arachidonic acid-dependent pro-inflammatory pathway. These data suggest that A beta 3(pE)-42 could mediate the neurodegenerative process and subsequent cognitive alteration occurring in preclinical AD stages.</AbstractText>"}

Most recently, several studies have demonstrated that the adult mammalian brain is indeed capable of neurogenesis and that the process is primarily confined to the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. Of these regions, the SVZ is the largest niche of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. Within this niche resides a subpopulation of astrocytes with stem cell-like features of self-renewal and multipotentiality. Interestingly, there is also a subpopulation of cells within brain tumors that possess these same characteristics. Based on these findings, the emerging hypothesis is that brain tumor stem cells may be derived from neural stem cells and that both of these populations may originate from the SVZ. This possible connection stresses the importance of studying and understanding the role that the human SVZ plays in not only harboring neural and brain tumor stem cells, but how this microenvironment may support both neurogenesis and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the obvious differences in the SVZ between humans and other animals make it important to understand the human model when studying human disease. Such an understanding may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for both neurodegenerative diseases and currently intractable brain tumors.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic systemic exposure of Lewis rats to rotenone produced many features of PD, and cerebral tauopathy was also detected in the case of severe weight loss. The present study was designed to assess the neurotoxicity of rotenone after daily oral administration for 28 days at several doses in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, we examined the protective effects of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) on nigral dopamine (DA) neurons in rotenone-treated mice. 4-PBA was injected intraperitoneally daily 30 min before each oral administration of rotenone. Chronic oral administration of rotenone at high doses induced specific nigrostriatal DA neurodegeneration, motor deficits and the up-regulation of alpha-synuclein in the surviving DA neurons. In contrast to the Lewis rat model, cerebral tauopathy was not detected in this mouse model. 4-PBA inhibited rotenone-induced neuronal death and decreased the protein level of alpha-synuclein. These results suggest that this rotenone mouse model may be useful for understanding the mechanism of DA neurodegeneration in PD, and that 4-PBA has a neuroprotective effect in the treatment of PD.</AbstractText>"}

However, to date little is known concerning the most prevalent protein-targets of AGE modification under normal, non-pathological conditions. Here, a combination of 2D-electrophoresis, Western blotting and mass spectrometry has been used to identify preferentially AGE-modified proteins in oligodendrocyte (OLN-93) and neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y) in standard culture. Proteomics analysis identified a total of eight targets with structural, metabolic and regulatory function, three of which (beta-actin, beta-tubulin and eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1-alpha) were common to both cell lines. Based on results from prior studies, modification of these proteins may lead to a loss of function.

In mammals, three main forms of autophagy have been described: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). CMA is the only autophagic pathway that allows selective degradation of soluble proteins in lysosomes. In contrast to the other mammalian forms of autophagy, CMA does not require vesicle formation or major changes in the lysosomal membrane. Instead, substrate proteins directly cross the lysosomal membrane to reach the lumen, where they are rapidly degraded. The substrate proteins are targeted to the lysosomal membrane by recognition of a targeting motif (a KFERQ-like motif), by a chaperone complex, consisting of hsc70 and its cochaperones, in the cytoplasm. Once at the lysosomal membrane, the protein interacts with a lysosomal receptor for this pathway, lysosomal associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), and it is translocated across the membrane into the lysosomal lumen assisted by a lysosome resident chaperone. These two characteristics--selectivity and direct substrate translocation--determine the particular role of CMA in different physiological and pathological conditions. In this chapter, we cover current findings on the molecular mechanisms for CMA and the possible pathophysiological relevance of this selective lysosomal degradation.</AbstractText>"}

Integrated transgenic C. elegans lines were generated that overexpress either human wildtype (WT) or mutant (A53T) forms.

There are undoubtedly few satisfactory animal models for exploring therapies targeting at amyloid beta (Abeta) secretion, deposition, aggregation, and probably the inflammatory response. However, an understanding of the complex events--tau, Abeta, oxidative stress, redox active iron, etc.--involved in the neuronal cell loss is still unclear due to the lack of a suitable animal model system. The use of neurotoxic agents particularly aluminum-organic complexes, especially Al-maltolate, expands the scope of AD research by providing new animal models exhibiting neurodegenerative processes relevant to AD neuropathology. Examination of different species of aged animals including the rapidly advancing transgenic mouse models revealed very limited AD-like pathology. Most other animal models have single event expression such as extracellular Abeta deposition, intraneuronal neurofilamentous aggregation of proteins akin to neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress or apoptosis. To date, there are no paradigms of any animal in which all the features of AD were evident. However, the intravenous injection of Al-maltolate into aged New zealand white rabbits results in conditions which mimics a number of neuropathological, biochemical and behavioral changes observed in AD. Such neurodegenerative effects include the formation of intraneuronal neurofilamentous aggregates that are tau positive, immunopositivity of Abeta, presence of redox active iron, oxidative stress and apoptosis, adds credence to the value of this animal model system. The use of this animal model should not be confused with the ongoing controversy regarding the possible role of Al in the neuropathogenesis, a debate which by no means has been concluded. Above all this animal model involving neuropathology induced by Al-maltolate provides a new information in understanding the mechanism of neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Gliosis is a fundamental CNS response to trauma or disease in which cell hypertrophy and proliferation play prominent roles. The DBA/2J mouse is a glaucoma model in which mice experience gliosis concomitant with raised intraocular pressure that leads to a slow and progressive retinal ganglion cell axonopathy. We sought to determine if glaucomatous changes in DBA/2 retina would alter the regulation of cell proliferation, specifically in relation to retinal glia. Astrocyte and Müller glia populations within DBA/2 retina upregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA and protein compared with C57Bl/6; microglial cell number increased twofold from 4 to 10 months. Various bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection paradigms were used to label dividing cells in DBA/2 and C57Bl/6 retina at 4 and 10 months of age. Very modest cell division in the retina, primarily in ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers, was observed at all ages. Immunohistochemistry indicated cell turnover primarily of NG2+ pericytes and Iba1+ microglia; astrocytes and Müller glia did not proliferate. There were no significant differences in BrdU+ cell numbers in 4 and 10-month-old retina, though 4-month retina had generally fewer BrdU+ cells than 10-month. C57Bl/6 retinas had fewer BrdU+ cells than DBA/2 retinas at all ages. These data show that, in contrast to gliosis in other CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases, glaucomatous changes in retina do not include substantive cell proliferation.

This receptor is broadly expressed on neurons throughout the brain together with its ligand and induced by ischemic insults. In primary cortical neurons and human neuroblastoma cells, GM-CSF counteracts programmed cell death and induces BCL-2 and BCL-Xl expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Of the signaling pathways studied, GM-CSF most prominently induced the PI3K-Akt pathway, and inhibition of Akt strongly decreased antiapoptotic activity. Intravenously given GM-CSF passes the blood-brain barrier, and decreases infarct damage in two different experimental stroke models (middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and combined common carotid/distal MCA occlusion) concomitant with induction of BCL-Xl expression. Thus, GM-CSF acts as a neuroprotective protein in the CNS. This finding is remarkably reminiscent of the recently discovered functionality of two other hematopoietic factors, erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the CNS. The identification of a third hematopoietic factor acting as a neurotrophic factor in the CNS suggests a common principle in the functional evolution of these factors.

Over the last century, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the cerebellum is also involved in memory and higher cognitive function. We have discovered that intrinsic survival pathways exist in cerebellar granule cells that are regulated by low level stimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors protects vulnerable neurons against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity acting on NMDA receptors.

It scavenges hydroxyl, carbonate and various organic radicals, peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species. Melatonyl radicals formed by scavenging combine with and, thereby, detoxify superoxide anions in processes terminating the radical reaction chains. Melatonin also enhances the antioxidant potential of the cell by stimulating the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, and by augmenting glutathione levels. The decline in melatonin production in aged individuals has been suggested as one of the primary contributing factors for the development of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. Melatonin has been shown to be effective in arresting neurodegenerative phenomena seen in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism and ischemic stroke. Melatonin preserves mitochondrial homeostasis, reduces free radical generation, e.g., by enhancing mitochondrial glutathione levels, and safeguards proton potential and ATP synthesis by stimulating complex I and IV activities. Therapeutic trials with melatonin have been effective in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease but not of Parkinson's disease.

Indeed, as ferritin is present in the brain, the ferrihydrite core could be a precursor for biogenic magnetite formation--particularly in cases where the normal functioning of the ferritin protein is disrupted. In this work, NMR relaxometry was used to detect magnetite inside samples of ferritin extracted from normal and Alzheimer-diseased brains. The method was first calibrated with different fractions of horse spleen ferritin and synthetic magnetite particles. The relaxometry results suggest that the proportion of iron contained in brain ferritin in the form of well-crystallized magnetite instead of ferrihydrite must be &lt;1%, which is much less than that reported for 'magnetite-like' phase in recent transmission electron microscopy studies of similar samples.

Recent progress suggests that ER stress and UPR play key roles in the immune response, diabetes, tumor growth under hypoxic conditions, and in some neurodegenerative diseases. Further research on ER stress and UPR will greatly enhance the understanding of these physiological and pathological processes, and provide novel avenues to potential therapies.</AbstractText>"}

A number of factors contribute to comorbidity and mortality and seizures are among the most common ones. Seizures worsen existing demantia, and by causing falls lead to serious complications like fractures and intracranial hemorrhage. Hippocampus is one of the earliest affected structures in brain in AD. It undergoes atrophy followed by progressive neuron loss. Atrophy appears much before the clinical manifestations of AD develop. Hence, there is a potential for its prevention or reversal. Neuron loss in brains of AD have two important consequences: these include development of AD and seizures. Patients of AD have unusually high incidence of seizures and the first seizure episode in this population is considered to be an indication of treatment with anti-seizure drugs. Among many drugs that have been shown to prevent hippocampal atrophy is phenytoin. It is time tested and proven anticonvulsant that can be used to prevent the development of atrophy and consequent development of AD. Phenytoin can thus be exploited for its dual effects i.e. reversal of hippocampal atrophy and anti-seizure effects. Selection of patients, appropriate dose, duration, monitoring and drug safety are important issues to be addressed before the testing of this hypothesis can be considered. Ideal candidates will be those who are at risk of development of AD or those with milder symptoms.</AbstractText>"}

Here we report that treatment with AM1241 was effective at slowing signs of disease progression when administered after onset of signs in an ALS mouse model (hSOD1(G93A) transgenic mice). Administration at the onset of tremors delayed motor impairment in treated mice when compared to vehicle controls. Three conditions of ALS, the loss of motor function, paralysis scoring and weight loss, were analyzed using a mathematical model. Loss of motor function (as assessed by performance on a rotarod) was delayed by 12.5 days in male mice by AM1241. In female mice, AM1241 extended rotarod performance by 3 days, although this was not statistically significant. In male mice, AM1241 also extended by 5 days the time to reach the 50% point on a visually-assessed performance scale. AM1241 did not affect weight loss or survival (129.8+/-1.7 days, vehicle; 129.1+/-7.0 days, AM1241, n=16). As AM1241 was well tolerated by the animals, cannabinoid CB2 receptor-selective compounds may be the basis for developing new drugs for the treatment of ALS and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Recent studies have provided clues to the cellular basis of this mitochondrial requirement. Mitochondria are regionally organized within some nerve cells, with higher accumulations in the soma, the hillock, the nodes of Ranvier and the nerve terminal. In the synaptic region, mitochondria regulate calcium and ATP levels, thereby maintaining synaptic transmission and structure. Defects in mitochondrial dynamics can cause deficits in mitochondrial respiration, morphology and motility. Moreover, mutations in the mitochondrial fusion genes Mitofusin-2 and OPA1 lead to the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A and dominant optic atrophy. Perhaps it is the strict spatial and functional requirements for mitochondria in neurons that cause defects in mitochondrial fusion to manifest primarily as neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The disease, which is linked to a polyQ tract elongation in the androgen receptor (ARpolyQ), has the interesting feature that ARpolyQ aggregation is triggered by the AR ligand, testosterone. Using immortalized motor neurons expressing ARpolyQ, we found that a proteasome reporter, YFPu, accumulated in absence of aggregates; testosterone treatment, which induced ARpolyQ aggregation, allowed the normal clearance of YFPu, suggesting that aggregation contributed to proteasome de-saturation, an effect not related to AR nuclear translocation.

Several markers of inflammation accompany neuronal death in TD and in these diseases. Studies in the submedial thalamic nucleus (SmTN), the region most sensitive to TD, have begun to define the temporal response of inflammation, immune response and neurodegeneration. Our previous studies show that the immune response is involved in TD-induced neurodegeneration. The current experiments tested the roles of other inflammatory cascades in TD-induced neuronal death. Deletion of genes for CD4, or CD8 (the co-receptors for T-cells), IFN-gamma (the cytokine produced by T-cell), or NADPH oxidase (the inflammation related oxidase) were tested. None protected against neuronal death in late stages of TD. On the other hand, deletion of the genes for CD4, CD8 and IFN-gamma increased the microglial activation, and deletion of the gene for NADPH oxidase decreased microglial activation when compared to control mice. In wild type mice, TD caused hypertrophy of CD68 positive microglia without increasing the number of microglia. However, TD induced hypertrophy and proliferation of CD68-positive microglia in the CD4 (97%), CD8 (57%) or IFN-gamma (96%) genetic knockout mice. In the genetic knockout mice for NADPH oxidase, the microglial activation was 65% less than the wild type mice. The results demonstrate that mice deficient in specific T cells (CD4-/-, CD8-/-) or activated T cell product, (IFN-gamma-/-) have increased microglia activation, but mice deficient in NADPH oxidase have decreased microglial activation. However, at the time point tested, the deletions were not neuroprotective. The results suggest that inflammatory responses play a role in TD-induced pathological changes in the brain, and the inflammation appears to be a late event that reflects a response to neuronal damage, which may spread the damage to other brain regions.</AbstractText>"}

Recent studies suggest that green tea flavonoids may be used for the prevention and treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenolic constituent of green tea, reduces Abeta generation in both murine neuron-like cells (N2a) transfected with the human 'Swedish' mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in primary neurons derived from Swedish mutant APP-overexpressing mice (Tg APPsw line 2576). In concert with these observations, we find that EGCG markedly promotes cleavage of the alpha-C-terminal fragment of APP and elevates the N-terminal APP cleavage product, soluble APP-alpha. These cleavage events are associated with elevated alpha-secretase activity and enhanced hydrolysis of tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme, a primary candidate alpha-secretase. As a validation of these findings in vivo, we treated Tg APPsw transgenic mice overproducing Abeta with EGCG and found decreased Abeta levels and plaques associated with promotion of the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase proteolytic pathway.

The nucleation of these beta-sheet aggregates is of particular interest, not only because it is the rate-determining step toward fiber formation but also because early, soluble aggregate species may be the cytotoxic entities in many diseases. In the case of the prion peptide H1 (residues 109-122 of the prion protein) stable amyloid fibers form only after the beta-strands of the peptide have adopted their equilibrium antiparallel beta-sheet configuration with residue 117 in register across all strands. In this article, we present the kinetic details of the realignment of these beta-strands from their fastformed nonequilibrium structure, which has no regular register of the strands, into the more ordered beta-sheets capable of aggregating into stable fibers. This process is likely the nucleating step toward the formation of stable fibers. Isotope-edited IR spectroscopy is used to monitor the alignment of the beta-strands by the introduction of a (13)C-labeled carbonyl at residue 117. Nonexponential kinetics is observed, with a complex dependence on concentration. The results are consistent with a mechanism in which the beta-sheet realigns by both the repeated detachment and annealing of strands in solution and reptation of polypeptide strands within an aggregate.</AbstractText>"}

We found that the transport of both of these proteins depend on an intact microtubule- but not actin-cytoskeleton, and that tau and alpha-synuclein both move at overall slow rates of transport. We used time-lapse video microscopy to obtain images of live neurons that had been transfected with plasmids expressing proteins tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein. We found that particulate structures containing tau or alpha-synuclein travel rapidly when moving along axons but spend the majority of the time paused, and these structures have similar characteristics to those previously observed for neurofilaments. The motile particles containing tau or alpha-synuclein colocalise with the fast-transporting molecular motor kinesin-1 in neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that tau and alpha-synuclein are each associated with complexes containing kinesin-1, whereas only alpha-synuclein appears to interact with dynein-containing complexes. In vitro glutathione S-transferase-binding assays using rat brain homogenate or recombinant protein as bait reveals a direct interaction of kinesin-1 light chains 1 and 2 with tau, but not with alpha-synuclein. Our findings suggest that the axonal transport of tau occurs via a mechanism utilising fast transport motors, including the kinesin family of proteins, and that alpha-synuclein transport in neurons may involve both kinesin and dynein motor proteins.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we have investigated the inflammatory response following 6-OHDA injected into the striatum of adult rats treated with diet enriched in blueberry or spirulina. One week after the dopamine lesion, a similar size of dopamine degeneration was found in the striatum and in the globus pallidus in all lesioned animals. At 1 week, a significant increase in OX-6- (MHC class II) positive microglia was found in animals fed with blueberry- and spirulina-enriched diets in both the striatum and the globus pallidus. These OX-6-positive cells were located within the area of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -negativity. At 1 month after the lesion, the number of OX-6-positive cells was reduced in diet-treated animals while a significant increase beyond that observed at 1 week was now present in lesioned control animals. Dopamine recovery as revealed by TH-immunohistochemistry was significantly enhanced at 4 weeks postlesion in the striatum while in the globus pallidus the density of TH-positive nerve fibers was not different from control-fed lesioned animals.

ER stress initiates a number of specific compensatory signaling pathways including unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is characterized by translational attenuation, synthesis of ER chaperone proteins such as glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78, also known as Bip), and transcriptional induction, which includes the activation of transcription factors such as activating transcriptional factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also known as growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 [GADD153]). Sustained ER stress ultimately leads to cell death. ER functions are believed to be impaired in various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in some acute disorders of the brain. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin family, functions as a neuroprotective agent and rescues neurons from various insults. The molecular mechanisms underlying BDNF neuroprotection, however, remain to be elucidated. We showed that CHOP partially mediated ER stress-induced neuronal death. BDNF suppressed ER stress-induced upregulation/ nuclear translocation of CHOP. The transcription of CHOP is regulated by ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1; BDNF selectively blocked the ATF6/CHOP pathway. Furthermore, BDNF inhibited the induction of death receptor 5 (DR5), a transcriptional target of CHOP. Our study thus suggests that suppression of CHOP activation may contribute to BDNF-mediated neuroprotection during ER stress responses.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Several intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play principal role in the neurodegenerative processes of various types. Among them, alpha-synuclein is involved in Parkinson's disease, prion protein in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and tau protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Neuronal damage in AD is accompanied by the presence of tau protein fibrils composed of paired helical filaments (PHF). 2. Tau protein represents a typical IDP. IDPs do not exhibit any stable secondary structure in the free form, but they are able to fold after binding to targets and contain regions with large propensity to adopt a defined type of secondary structure. Binding-folding event at tau protein leading to PHF generation is believed to happen in the course of tauopathies. 3. Detailed molecular topology of PHF formation is unknown. There are evidences about the cross-beta structure in PHF core; however the precise arrangement of the tau polypeptide chain is unclear. In this review we summarize current attempts at in vitro PHF reconstruction and the development of methods for PHF structure determination. The emphasis is put on the monoclonal antibodies used as structural molecular probes for research on the role of IDPs in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Hyperphosphorylation and intracellular fibrillar formation of tau protein is a pathology found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders referred to as 'taupathies'. In the present study, we investigated how brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an extracellular factor that is down-regulated in AD brains, affects tau phosphorylation. BDNF stimulation of neuronally differentiated P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells resulted in a rapid decrease in tau phosphorylation, at phosphorylation sites recognized by Tau 1, AT 8, AT 180 and p 262-Tau antibodies. K 252 a, a tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk) inhibitor, attenuated this dephosphorylation event, suggesting that BNDF activation of TrkB is responsible for the tau dephosphorylation. In addition, BDNF had no affect on tau phosphorylation in the presence of wortmannin, a PI-3 Kinase inhibitor, or lithium, a GSK 3 beta inhibitor, suggesting that these two kinases are part of the signaling transduction cascade leading from TrkB receptor activation to tau dephosphorylation. These results suggest a link between a correlate of AD, decrease in BDNF levels and an AD pathology, tau hyperphosphorylation.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated if endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores participate in neuronal death triggered by moderate glycolysis inhibition induced by iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, in cultured hippocampal neurons. Results show that exposure to iodoacetate leads to a slow partial decrease in cell survival, which is significantly prevented in the absence of Ca(2+) or in the presence of the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. Treatment with caffeine and a low (1 microM) concentration of ryanodine, which activates the ryanodine receptor (RyR), exacerbates neuronal death, whereas dantrolene and 25 microM ryanodine, which antagonizes RyR, prevents damage. Xestospongin C (XeC), an antagonist of the inositol-3-phosphate (IP(3)) receptor (IP(3)R) also prevents neuronal damage. Inhibitors of the ER calcium ATPase (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase; SERCA) have no effect. The decrease in ATP levels induced by iodoacetate is potentiated by caffeine and prevented by dantrolene. Although only a slight increase in glutamate extracellular levels is observed 3.5 hr after iodoacetate exposure, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, MK-801, efficiently prevents neuronal damage. Taken together, the data suggest that neuronal death induced during moderate glycolysis inhibition involves calcium influx through NMDA receptors and calcium release from intracellular ER stores. These results might be relevant to the understanding the mechanisms involved in neuronal damage related to aging and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, which have been associated with decreased glucose metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study was to establish an organotypic in vitro model for investigating effects of the amyloid beta (Abeta)-peptide on pyramidal neuron degeneration, glial cell activation and tau phosphorylation. Tissue cultures in a quasi-monolayer were obtained using roller-drum incubation of hippocampal slices from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats. Neuronal populations identified included N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA-R1) receptor immunoreactive pyramidal neurons, and neurons immunopositive for glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) or gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). Many neurons expressed phosphorylated tau as shown by pS(396), AD2 and PHF-tau immunostaining. Astrocytes, microglial cells and macrophages were also identified. The Abeta(25-35) peptide formed fibrillar networks within 2 days as demonstrated by electron microscopy. In the presence of the neurotoxic Abeta(25-35) peptide, but not Abeta(35-25), deposits developed in the tissue that were stainable with Thioflavine T and Congo red and showed the characteristic birefringence of Abeta plaques. Following Abeta(25-35) exposure, neurodegenerative cells were observed with Fluoro-Jade B staining. Further characterization of pyramidal neurons immunopositive for NMDA-R1 showed a decrease of cell number in the immediate surrounding of Abeta(25-35) deposits in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Similar effects on pyramidal neurons were obtained following exposure to the full-length, Abeta(1-40) peptide. Also, a loss of neuronal processes was seen with GAD65, but not GABA, immunohistochemistry after exposure to Abeta(25-35). Abeta(25-35)-exposed neurons immunopositive for phospho-tau showed degenerating, bent and often fragmented processes. Astrocytes showed increased GFAP-positive reactivity after Abeta(25-35) exposure and formation of large networks of processes. No obvious effect on microglial cells and macrophages could be seen after the Abeta(25-35) exposure. The developed in vitro system may constitute a useful tool for screening novel drugs against Abeta-induced alterations of tau and degeneration of hippocampal neurons.</AbstractText>"}

Ubiquitylated aggregates containing mutant huntingtin protein in neurons are hallmarks of HD. Misfolded mutant huntingtin monomers, oligomers, or aggregates may be a result of, and cause, ubiquitin- proteasome dysfunction. To investigate the ubiquitin-proteasome system we designed a series of firefly luciferase reporters targeted selectively to different points along this pathway. These reporters were used to monitor ubiquitin-proteasome system function in a striatal cell culture model of HD. Ubiquitylation processes were not reduced in mutant huntingtin cells but recognition or degradation of ubiquitylated substrates was decreased. We also found mutant huntingtin expressing cells had slight but significant decreases in chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, and an unexpected increase in trypsin-like activity of the proteasome core. General proteasome core inhibitors, as well as selective caspase-like activity inhibitors, were less effective in mutant cells. Finally, treatment with 3-nitropropionic acid, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, had opposite effects on the ubiquitin-proteasome system with activation in wild-type and decreased activity in mutant huntingtin expressing cells. The results of these experiments show clearly selective disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in this cell culture model of HD. The high throughput tools that we have designed and optimized will also be useful in identifying compounds that alter ubiquitin-proteasome system function and to investigate other neurodegenerative diseases such Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Complex mitochondrial features decisive for cell death execution in mammals are present and functional in yeast: AIF and cytochrome c release to the cytosol, mitochondrial fragmentation as well as mitochondrial hyperpolarisation followed by an oxidative burst, and breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential. The easy accessibility of mitochondrial manipulations such as repression of respiration by growing yeast on glucose or deletion of mitochondrial DNA (rho(0)) on the one hand and the unique ability of yeast cells to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources by switching on mitochondrial respiration on the other hand have made yeast an excellent tool to delineate the necessity for mitochondria in cell death execution. Yeast research indicates that the connection between mitochondria and apoptosis is intricate, as abrogation of mitochondrial function can be either deleterious or beneficial for the cell depending on the specific context of the death scenario. Surprisingly, mitochondrion dependent yeast apoptosis currently helps to understand the aetiology (or the complex biology) of lethal cytoskeletal alterations, ageing and neurodegeneration. For example, mutation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase or CDC48/VCP mutations, both implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, are associated with mitochondrial impairment and apoptosis in yeast.</AbstractText>"}

It relies on interactions between episodic memory, associated emotions, and a sense of self-continuity along the time axis of one's personal life history. Evidence exists that autobiographical memory performance as well as its underlying brain mechanisms are influenced by genetic, physiological, psychological, situational, and social-cultural factors. In particular, age (normal cognitive aging as well as age of memories, as defined by the time interval elapsed since information encoding) and gender affect both the performance level and the neural substrates of autobiographical recollection. In this review, studies concerned with aging and gender effects on autobiographical memory are discussed with reference to other age- and gender-related influences on human cognition, as well as clinical data on demented patients. Both age and gender act upon the functional hemispheric lateralization of autobiographical recollection and the prefrontal, hippocampal and parahippocampal engagement in information processing. On the performance level, re-collective qualities such as episodic detail and emotional intensity of autobiographical memories are modulated by both factors. Although the effects of aging and gender on human brain function are built upon different genetic and physiological mechanisms, they influence at least in part the same neurofunctional and behavioral dimensions of autobiographical recollection. Interestingly, age- and gender-related specificities in the neural mechanisms of autobiographical recollection need not be reflected on the performance level.</AbstractText>"}

Quercetin could suppress LPS- and IFN-gamma-induced NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene transcription, while quercetin-3'-sulfate had no effect.

Motor co-ordination was tested in both groups. Memory test and NO determination were carried out in another set of young and aged groups, 15 min after intraperitoneal administration of NO precursor, L-arginine (500, 1000 mg/kg) or NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1.25, 2.5 mg/kg). No difference was found between the motor co-ordination performances of young and aged animals. But the aged animals were not able to perform the shock avoidance pole-climbing task as readily as the young animals. It is suggestive of an impairment of memory formation of the acquired task in the aged animals. The synthesis of NO which is known to regulate memory process in the hippocampus, was lower in this brain region of aged animals as compared to that in young animals. L-arginine (1000 mg/kg) and SNP (2.5 mg/kg) increased the concentration of NO in the hippocampus and shortened the time of pole-climbing shock avoidance task in young as well as in aged animals. These results lead to a conclusion that a decreased synthesis of NO in the hippocampus in responsible for an impairment of memory formation in aged animals and that an increase in the concentration of NO in the hippocampus by L-arginine (1000 mg/kg) or SNP (2.5 mg/kg) results in a promotion of memory formation in the young adult rats and a reversal of memory deterioration in the aged animals.

The classical form of SD, enriched in the Finnish population, is related to the p.R39C designed Salla(FIN) founder mutation. A more severe phenotype is due both to compound heterozygosity for the p.R39C mutation and to different mutations. The p.R39C has not been reported in ISSD. We identified the first case of SD caused by the homozygosity for p.K136E (c.406A&gt;G) mutation, showing a severe clinical picture, as demonstrated by the early age at onset, the degree of motor retardation, the occurrence of peripheral nerve involvement, as well as cerebral hypomyelination. Recently, in vitro functional studies have shown that the p.K136E mutant produces a mislocalization and a reduced activity of the intracellular sialin. We discuss the in vivo phenotypic consequence of the p.K136E in relation to the results obtained by the in vitro functional characterization of the p.K136E mutant. The severity of the clinical picture, in comparison with the classical SD, may be explained by the fact that the p.K136E mutation mislocalizes the protein to a greater degree than p.R39C. On the other hand, the presence of a residual transport activity may account for the absence of hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and early lethality typical of ISSD and related to the abolished transport activity found in this latter form.</AbstractText>"}

Many such diseases are characterized by conformational changes in proteins that result in their misfolding and aggregation. Accumulating evidence implies that at least two pathways affect protein folding: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and molecular chaperones. Normal protein degradation by the UPS can prevent accumulation of aberrantly folded proteins. Molecular chaperones - such as protein-disulfide isomerase, glucose-regulated protein 78, and heat shock proteins - can provide neuroprotection from aberrant proteins by facilitating proper folding and thus preventing their aggregation. Our recent studies have linked nitrosative stress to protein misfolding and neuronal cell death. Here, we present evidence for the hypothesis that nitric oxide contributes to degenerative conditions by S-nitrosylating specific chaperones or UPS proteins that would otherwise prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Within the Ras superfamily, the Arf family is composed of 30 members in mammals, including 22 Arf-like (Arl) proteins. Much less is known about the mechanisms of cell regulation by Arls than by Arfs. We report the purification from bovine testis of an Arl2 GAP and its identity as ELMOD2, a protein with no previously described function. ELMOD2 is one of six human proteins that contain an ELMO domain, and a second member, ELMOD1, was also found to have Arl2 GAP activity. Surprisingly, ELMOD2 also exhibited GAP activity against Arf proteins even though it does not contain the canonical Arf GAP sequence signature. The broader specificity of ELMOD2, as well as the previously described role for ELMO1 and ELMO2 in linking Arf6 and Rac1 signaling, suggests that ELMO family members may play a more general role in integrating signaling pathways controlled by Arls and other GTPases.</AbstractText>"}

It is generally accepted that beta-N-oxalylamino-l-alanine (b-ODAP), a non-protein amino acid present in the seeds is the primary causative agent. Based on in vitro studies with beta-ODAP, both excitotoxic and oxidative stress mechanisms have been speculated to be responsible for its neurotoxic effects. However, occurrence and the involvement of oxidative stress mechanisms in experimental animals following Khesari dhal consumption in vivo is less well understood. Accordingly in the present study, we have addressed primarily two questions: (i) whether dietary intake of Khesari dhal (KD) causes oxidative impairment in specific regions of brain, such as cortex and cerebellum and (ii) if there is any significant reduction in the oxidative damage induction following consumption of detoxified Khesari dhal (DKD). Adult male mice were fed either normal, KD or DKD incorporated diet (30%) for a period of 4 or 12 weeks. Biochemical markers of oxidative stress, such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activity of antioxidant enzymes, protein carbonyls in brain regions (cortex, cerebellum) were determined. Mice fed KD diet showed enhanced LPO levels and ROS generation in brain, while the levels of LPO and ROS were unaltered in DKD mice. Interim sampling (4 weeks) also showed a similar trend though the degree of oxidative damage was lower. Depletion of reduced GSH, significant alterations in the activity of various antioxidant enzymes and enhanced protein carbonyls in brain in KD fed mice suggested that a state of oxidative stress exists in vivo. Interestingly, no significant induction of oxidative damage was evident in the brain of mice fed DKD. However, altered cholinergic function was discernible among both treatment groups. KD consumption resulted in a marked reduction of brain AChE activity at both sampling times (cortex, 38-43%; cerebellum, 22-41%), while DKD consumption resulted in less robust reduction (cortex, 11-17%; cerebellum, 11-13%). Taken together, these data suggest that dietary KD has the propensity to induce marked oxidative damage in brain of male mice, while DKD failed to induce any significant degree of oxidative impairments. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that oxidative stress mechanisms may wholly or in part contribute towards the development of neuro-degeneration associated with human consumption of L. sativus.</AbstractText>"}

Both toxic phenomena are mitigated by DJ-1, a homodimeric protein with proposed antioxidant and chaperone activities. The neuroprotective function of DJ-1 is modulated by oxidation of cysteine 106, a residue that may act as an oxidative stress sensor. Loss-of-function mutations in the DJ-1 gene have been linked to early onset PD, and age-dependent over-oxidation of DJ-1 is thought to contribute to sporadic PD. The familial mutant L166P fails to dimerize and is rapidly degraded, suggesting that protein destabilization accounts for the dysfunction of this mutant. In this study, we investigated how the structure and stability of DJ-1 are impacted by two other pathogenic substitutions (M26I and E64D) and by over-oxidation with H2O2. Whereas the recombinant wild-type protein and E64D both adopted a stable dimeric structure, M26I showed an increased propensity to aggregate and decreased secondary structure. Similar to M26I, over-oxidized wild-type DJ-1 exhibited reduced secondary structure, and this property correlated with destabilization of the dimer. The engineered mutant C106A had a greater thermodynamic stability and was more resistant to oxidation-induced destabilization than the wild-type protein. These results suggest that (i) the M26I substitution and over-oxidation destabilize dimeric DJ-1, and (ii) the oxidation of cysteine 106 contributes to DJ-1 destabilization. Our findings provide a structural basis for DJ-1 dysfunction in familial and sporadic PD, and they suggest that dimer stabilization is a reasonable therapeutic strategy to treat both forms of this disorder.</AbstractText>"}

It is a common finding in elderly individuals, defined by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) depositions in cerebral blood vessels, and associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A variety of genetic mutations cause hereditary forms of CAA; in this review, however, only the sporadic variant of CAA is considered. In CAA, Abeta depositions primarily occur in the abluminal portion of the tunica media, and with increasing severity all layers of the blood vessel wall are infiltrated and an additional spread of Abeta into the surrounding neuropil may be seen (i.e., dyshoric changes). CAA is most pronounced in the occipital lobe and its distribution is usually patchy. The relationship between CAA and AD is poorly understood; however, low positive correlations between the severity of both CAA and AD pathology have been observed. CAA is a frequent cause of (warfarin-associated) intracerebral hemorrhage, and the diagnosis of probable CAA-related hemorrhage can be made during life with high accuracy. Both APOE-epsilon4 and APOE-epsilon2 are risk factors for CAA, while only APOE-epsilon2 increases the risk for hemorrhage in CAA. Although the role of CAA as an independent risk factor for cognitive decline is unclear, severe CAA is likely to lower the threshold for clinically overt dementia in neurodegenerative diseases. As for the origin of Abeta in CAA, it may be both produced by smooth muscle cells (vessel wall) and derived from neurons in the course of perivascular drainage.</AbstractText>"}

More generally, if mutations in sequence or changes in environmental conditions lead to partial unfolding of the native state of a protein, it will often aggregate, sometimes into well-defined fibrillar structures. A great deal of interest has been directed at discovering the characteristic features of metastable partially unfolded states that precede the aggregated states of proteins. In this work, human muscle acylphosphatase (AcP) has been first destabilized, by addition of urea or by means of elevated temperatures, and then incubated in the presence of different concentrations of 2,2,2, trifluoroethanol ranging from 5% to 25% (v/v). The results show that AcP is able to form both fibrillar and nonfibrillar aggregates with a high beta-sheet content from partially unfolded states with very different structural features. Moreover, the presence of alpha-helical structure in such a state does not appear to be a fundamental determinant of the ability to aggregate. The lack of ready aggregation under some of the conditions examined here is attributable primarily to the intrinsic properties of the solutions rather than to specific structural features of the partially unfolded states that precede aggregation. Aggregation appears to be favored when the solution conditions promote stable intermolecular interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds. In addition, the structures of the resulting aggregates are largely independent of the conformational properties of their soluble precursors.</AbstractText>"}

We herein describe the biochemical features of wild-type and mutant GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin. An overexpression of wild-type GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin in Chinese hamster ovary cells led to the formation of aggresome-like inclusions, especially in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. As expected from the properties of aggresomes, the inclusions were colocalized with gamma-tubulin and a disruption of microtubules using nocodazole blocked the formation of such inclusions. Aceruloplasminemia-linked mutant proteins failed to form such inclusions even after treatment with proteasomal inhibitors. An immunofluorescent analysis indicated that the mutant proteins were thus retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the transfected cells showed a decreased viability. The expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 that is one of the ER stress sensor proteins, and the activity of glucose-regulated protein 78 promoter was upregulated in the cells transfected with the mutants. These findings indicated that when the overexpressed cytoplasmic wild-type ceruloplasmin was not subjected to degradation by the proteasome-ubiquitin system, then the wild-type protein was transported along the microtubules, thus forming inclusions at the microtubule organizing center, whereas the mutant ceruloplasmin failed to form any such inclusions, because the mutant protein might not have been translocated across the ER into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the mutant protein was considered to have accumulated in the ER thus leading to the ER stress, which resulted in cell death.</AbstractText>"}

MK2 activation and expression were increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon gamma-stimulated microglial cells, implicating a role for MK2 in eliciting a pro-inflammatory response. Microglia cultured ex vivo from MK2-deficient (MK2-/-) mice demonstrated significant inhibition in release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, KC (mouse chemokine with highest sequence identity to human GROs and interleukin-8), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha on stimulation with LPS + interferon gamma or amyloid-beta peptide (1-42) compared with MK2+/+ wild-type microglia.

The mechanisms implicated in this aberrant protein deposition remain elusive. In these disorders signs of inflammation are also apparent in the affected central nervous system areas. We show that prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), an endogenous product of inflammation, disrupts the cytoskeleton in neuronal cells. Furthermore, PGJ2 perturbed microtubule polymerization in vitro and decreased the number of free sulfhydryl groups on tubulin cysteines. A direct effect of PGJ2 on actin was not apparent, although actin filaments were altered in cells treated with PGJ2. This cyclopentenone prostaglandin triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) collapse and the redistribution of ER proteins, such as calnexin and catechol-O-methyltransferase, into a large centrosomal aggregate containing ubiquitinated proteins and alpha-synuclein. The PGJ2-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement paralleled the development of the large centrosomal aggregate. Both of these events were replicated by treating cells with colchicine, which disrupts the microtubule/ER network, but not with brefeldin A, which impairs ER/Golgi transport. PGJ2 also perturbed 26 S proteasome assembly and activity, which preceded the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins as detergent/salt-insoluble aggregates. Our data support a mechanism by which, upon PGJ2 treatment, cytoskeleton/ER collapse coincides with the relocation of ER proteins, other potentially neighboring proteins, and ubiquitinated proteins into centrosomal aggregates. Development of these large perinuclear aggregates is associated with disruption of the microtubule/ER network. This aberrant protein deposition, triggered by a product of inflammation, may be common to other compounds that disrupt microtubules and induce protein aggregation, such as MPP+ and rotenone, found to be associated with neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Pharmacological approaches, including intrathecal baclofen, can be undermined by tolerance.

The neuroprotective effects underlying the efficacy of PARP-1 inhibitors in PD models suggest a role for PARP-1 in neurodegeneration. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of PARP-1 inhibition in two distinct PD models. First, we tested a panel of small molecule PARP-1 inhibitors in alpha-synuclein (aSyn) cytotoxicity assay, where we observed compound-dependent ameliorating effects. Next, we tested the same panel in primary ventral mesencephalic neuronal cultures, treated with MPP(+). Dopaminergic neurons, the primary cells affected in PD, were selected and subjected to analysis. A significant ameliorating effect was achieved only with a highly potent PARP-1 inhibitor. Our data implicates aberrant PARP-1 function in different pathways of neurodegeneration. Further, our results suggest a rationale for the development of highly potent, bio-available, brain-penetrable PARP-1 inhibitors to provide therapeutic benefits for Parkinson's patients.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we aimed at characterizing cerebral compensation during motor imagery in Parkinson's disease (PD), while controlling for altered motor execution and sensory feedback. We used a within-patient design to compare the most and least affected hand in 19 right-handed PD patients with markedly right-lateralized symptoms. We used a motor imagery (MI) task in which the patients were required to judge the laterality of hand images, rotated either in a lateral or in a medial orientation with respect to the body sagittal plane. This design allowed us to compare cerebral activity (using fMRI) evoked by MI of each hand separately, while objectively monitoring task performance. Reaction times and parieto-premotor activity increased in a similar manner as a function of stimulus rotation during motor imagery of left and right hands. However, patients were markedly slower when judging images of the affected hand in lateral orientations, and there was a corresponding increase in activity in the right extrastriate body area (EBA) and occipito-parietal cortex during mental rotation of the affected hand. Furthermore, these regions increased their connectivity towards the left PMd for right (affected) hands in a lateral orientation. We infer that, in strongly lateralized PD patients, motor imagery of the most-affected hand exploits additional resources in extrastriate visual areas. These findings characterize the cerebral bases of the increased dependence on visual information processing during the generation of motor plans in PD, pointing to its compensatory role.</AbstractText>"}

Furthermore, it may be involved in proinflammatory processes of prion diseases. However, little is known about the induction and regulation of PrP106-126-induced receptor endocytosis. We have thus analysed whether PrP106-126 increases the activity of phospholipase D (PLD) via FPRL1, an enzyme involved in the regulation of the secretion, endocytosis and receptor signalling, in glial cells. PLD activity was determined using a transphosphatidylation assay and the internalization of PrP106-126, and FPRL1 was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and quantified by ELISA. We could show that PLD is activated by PrP106-126 both in astrocytes and microglia, and moreover that PrP106-126 is rapidly internalized via FPRL1 in astrocytes and microglia cells. The determination of receptor activity by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 phosphorylation and cAMP level measurement verified the PrP106-126-induced activation of FPRL1. FPRL1-mediated PrP106-126 uptake was blocked by the receptor antagonist chenodeoxycholic acid. These studies indicate the involvement of FPRL1-mediated cellular signalling in PrP106-126-endocytosis and may allow the development of therapeutic agents interfering with prion uptake and/or PLD function, using either PLD or the FPRL1 as a possible pharmaceutical target.</AbstractText>"}

Gene expression analysis of healthy tissues may provide clues to the differences that distinguish resistant and sensitive tissues and cell types. Comparative analysis of gene expression in healthy mouse and human brain provides a framework to explore the ability of mice to model diseases of the human brain. It may also aid in understanding brain evolution and the basis for higher order cognitive abilities. Here we compare gene expression profiles of human motor cortex, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum to one another and identify genes that are more highly expressed in one region relative to another. We separately perform identical analysis on corresponding brain regions from mice. Within each species, we find that the different brain regions have distinctly different expression profiles. Contrasting between the two species shows that regionally enriched genes in one species are generally regionally enriched genes in the other species. Thus, even when considering thousands of genes, the expression ratios in two regions from one species are significantly correlated with expression ratios in the other species. Finally, genes whose expression is higher in one area of the brain relative to the other areas, in other words genes with patterned expression, tend to have greater conservation of nucleotide sequence than more widely expressed genes. Together these observations suggest that region-specific genes have been conserved in the mammalian brain at both the sequence and gene expression levels. Given the general similarity between patterns of gene expression in healthy human and mouse brains, we believe it is reasonable to expect a high degree of concordance between microarray phenotypes of human neurodegenerative diseases and their mouse models. Finally, these data on very divergent species provide context for studies in more closely related species that address questions such as the origins of cognitive differences.</AbstractText>"}

Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of a misfolded prion protein, PrPSc, which is made by a posttranslational conformational change of the host-encoded cellular prion protein, PrPC. The process of the conformational change remains enigmatic, but a large number of researches on the therapeutic intervention have been done in experimental models over the past 30 years. Against the background of the occurrence of variant CJD in the UK in the 1990s, which is considered to occur by transmission of the BSE agent and to possibly spread through secondary infection via blood transfusion, the research on the development of therapeutic agents has been accelerated using an increasing number of disease models in animals, cells and in vitro system. Candidate therapeutic targets for prion diseases include the following four factors: the PrPC; the PrPSc; the cellular factors associated with the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc; the cellular factors responsible for the neurodegenerative processes. In this article, recent advances in the therapeutic development for prion diseases on the basis of molecular targeting are reviewed, and its future perspectives are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

In the pathogenesis of the polyglutamine diseases, expansion of the polyglutamine stretch causes misfolding and conformational alterations of the disease-causing proteins, leading to pathogenic protein-protein interactions including aggregate formation, and subsequently resulting in their deposition as inclusion bodies in affected neurons. Expression of these expanded polyglutamine proteins has been reported to impair protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, axonal transport, mitochondrial function, etc., which eventually result in neurodegeneration. Currently, a wide variety of research towards establishing therapies targeting each step in the pathogenesis of the polyglutamine diseases is in progress, which includes suppressing mutant gene expression by RNAi, inhibiting protein misfolding/aggregation, promoting protein degradation, activating transcription, activating mitochondrial function, inhibiting neuronal cell death, and neuroprotection by neurotrophic factors. Standardized validation of these preclinical studies and development of sensitive biomarkers for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials will be necessary for development of drugs for the polyglutamine diseases.</AbstractText>"}

They also have found that antibodies to A-beta have similar effect. Since immunized mice showed improvement of cognitive functions, an active immunization method was tested in humans. However, the trial was halted because of side effect, subacute meningoencephalitis due to T-cell mediated autoimmune responses. We developed a safe oral A-beta vaccine using adeno-associated virus vector. When this vaccine was given once, antibodies were elevated well and high titers were kept for over 6 months. APP transgenic mice and old monkeys showed significant reduction of amyloid burden without any side effect.

Uncovering new prion- and amyloid-related processes may be helped greatly by a procedure for purification of amyloid polymers. Studies of growth and propagation of these polymers require methods for determination of their size. Here, we describe such methods.

Genetically, HSPs are divided into autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked (XL) forms. Up to date, 30 different HSPs are linked to different chromosomal loci and 11 genes could be defined for AR-HSP, AD-HSP and XL-HSP.

We examined the morphological correlates in the response to intrastriatal grafting of fragments of foetal rat ventral mesencephalic tissue 1 month after transplantation in male Wistar rats within varying durations (from 2 to 38 weeks) of experimentally induced neurodegenerative process of the striatum (used as a model of Huntington's disease). Our goal was to determine the impact of advanced striatal damage and gliosis on the graft viability and host-graft integration. 3. The findings can be summarized as follows: The progressive reactive gliosis, which is not able to compensate continual reduction of the grey matter leading to an extensive atrophy of the striatum in a long-term lesions, results in formation of the compact glial network. This tissue cannot be considered the suitable terrain for successful graft development and formation of host-graft interconnections. 4.

However, no studies on Alzheimer disease (AD) have been reported in which cell loss and significant synaptic reorganization occurs. In the present study, we analyze in detail the expression of Nogo-A in the hippocampal formation in normal human aging and in AD. Our results indicate that Nogo-A is expressed by oligodendrocytes and neurons in the aged hippocampal formation. In addition, both granule cells and mossy fiber connections are also labeled in the old-aged hippocampi. Interestingly, Nogo-A is over-expressed by hippocampal neurons in AD and is associated with beta-amyloid deposits in senile plaques. Taken together, our results reinforce the hypothesis that Reticulon proteins such as Nogo-A participate in the neuronal responses stemming from hippocampal formation during senescence, and particularly in AD.

Since CNS-dysfunction usually preceeds development of the pathognomonic 'steely' hair, delay of clinical diagnosis and onset of therapeutic intervention precludes longlasting neurological benefit. This is particularly true for patients with large deletions or severe truncations of the responsible ATP7A gene. We report on our own experience with a patient, who was diagnosed to be affected by Menkes' syndrome at the age of one year, due to the specific hair texture and biochemical abnormalities. Molecular investigation revealed a total deletion of exon 15 of the ATP7A gene. Heterozygosity was confirmed by means of real-time PCR in the child's mother, but could be excluded in the grandmother and other female relatives at risk. Therapeutic support with subcutaneous injection of copper-histidinate normalised diminished copper and coeruloplasmin serum levels, but was unable to influence the clinical course and to prevent the fatal outcome at the age of two years. This observation is in line with the experience of the literature claiming that currently available medication will hardly be able to normalise brain copper levels.

Repair of ROS-damaged bases occurs mainly via base excision repair (BER) in mitochondria and nuclei. In nuclear BER, the two penultimate steps are carried out by DNA polymerase-beta (Polbeta), which exhibits both 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5'-dRP) lyase and DNA polymerase activities. In mitochondria, DNA polymerase-gamma (Polgamma) is believed to be the sole polymerase and is therefore assumed to function in mitochondrial BER. However, a recent report suggested the presence of Polbeta or a 'Polbeta-like' enzyme in bovine mitochondria. Consequently, in the present work, we tested the hypothesis that Polbeta is present and functions in mammalian mitochondria. Initially we identified two DNA polymerase activities, one corresponding to Polgamma and the other to Polbeta, in mitochondrial preparations obtained by differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, upon further fractionation in linear Percoll gradients, we were able to separate Polbeta from mitochondria and to show that intact mitochondria, identified by electron microscopy, lacked Polbeta activity. In a functional test for the presence of Polbeta function in mitochondria, we used a new assay for detection of random (i.e., non-clonal) mutations in single mtDNA molecules. We did not detect enhanced mutation frequency in mtDNA from Polbeta null cells. In contrast, mtDNA from cells harboring mutations in the Polgamma exonuclease domain that abolish proofreading displayed a &gt;or=17-fold increase in mutation frequency.

Given a small number of patients and a slow progression of symptoms, it is important to carry out effective trials using surrogate endpoints or historical control data, if necessary. In particular, pathogenesis-based disease-modifying therapy should be carefully evaluated in clinical trials, because its effect is likely to be suppression of neurodegenerative processes, but not symptom relief. The development of androgen deprivation therapy for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a representative study in this field. SBMA is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat, which encodes the polyglutamine tract, in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Animal models carrying human mutant AR gene recapitulate polyglutamine-mediated motor neuron degeneration, providing insights into the pathogenesis of SBMA. There is increasing evidence that testosterone, the ligand of AR, plays a pivotal role in the neurodegeneration in SBMA.

(-)-Deprenyl prevents the toxicity of certain selective neurotoxins and recently it was demonstrated to increase cell-cell adhesion as well. The complexity of its pharmacological effects reflects the action of both the parent compound and the active metabolites. (-)-Deprenyl and related propargylamines (DRPs) show neuroprotective features in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models that is dependent on the propargyl moiety. The main presumptive targets to date include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, some kinase cascades, as well as pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, beside the inhibition of MAO-B. The antiapoptotic activity of DRPs converges upon the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, due to the initiation of a complex transcriptional program, the details of which are yet to be elucidated.</AbstractText>"}

At present there is not a perfect animal model of PD to test neuroprotective strategies, however the models that portray the basic characteristics needed are toxin-induced and gene-based models. The first group comprehends 6-OHDA e MPTP and recently rotenone, paraquat and epoxomicin treated animals that shows some of human disease characteristics. Gene-based models are various and, even if with limits, they seem suitable models to test neuroprotection in PD since they present replicable lesions, a predictable pattern of neurodegeneration and a well-characterized behavior, biochemistry and morphology to assist in the understanding of induced changes. In clinical trials researchers have first used as marker of disease progression clinical scores and motor tasks which are limited by the potential symptomatic effect of tested drugs and are not useful in the pre-clinical phases of PD. Recently has emerged the important role of neuroimaging (Dopamine Transporter SPECT, 18FDopa-PET) as surrogate biomarker of PD progression. Even if there are still concerns about the influence of regulatory effects of tested drugs, neuroimaging features could represent a good outcome measure to evaluate PD progression and putative neuroprotective effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological manipulations.</AbstractText>"}

Increased numbers of autophagosomes and autolysosomes often represent prominent ultrastructural features of degenerating or dying neurons. This morphology is characteristic not only of neurons undergoing pathologic degeneration, but also during developmental programmed cell death of some neuronal populations. In recent years, a growing number of reports highlight potentially important roles for autophagy-related processes in relation to protein aggregation, regulated cell death pathways, and neurodegeneration. While starvation-induced autophagy involves nonselective bulk degradation of cytoplasm, mechanisms that regulate selective targeting of damaged organelles form an emerging area. As the study of autophagy evolves from physiologic homeostasis to pathologic situations, consideration of terminology and definitions becomes important. Increased autophagic vacuoles do not necessarily correlate with increased autophagic activity or flux. Instead, the striking accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in dying or degenerating neurons likely reflects an imbalance between the rates of autophagic sequestration and completion of the degradative process. In other words, these cells can be thought of as undergoing 'autophagic stress.' The concept of autophagic stress may reconcile apparently conflicting roles of autophagy-related processes in adaptive, homeostatic responses and in pathways of neurodegeneration and cell death.</AbstractText>"}

Glutamate may, therefore, play an important role in amyloid beta-protein-induced cytotoxicity in the cerebral cortex. Results show that cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil protect cortical neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity via alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at least partly by inhibiting the process of apoptosis. Donepezil also protects against ischemic insults such as those seen in vascular dementia; however, this does not seem to be mediated by nicotinic receptors.

Interestingly, there were reductions in total NR1 proteins but two phosphorylated forms of NR1 proteins at serine 896 and 897 residues were not reduced. There was also no change in the pattern of distribution of NR1 immunoreactivity in the striatal neurons. In addition, significant reductions of NMDA-mediated peak inward current were found after application of a higher concentration of ANR1 (20-100 microM) by patch clamp recordings. The present results indicate that ANR1 is a useful agent in reducing NMDA receptor functions. The present data thus provide detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms to explain our previous findings of amelioration of motor symptoms in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. More importantly, application of ANR1 was also found to display neuroprotective effects of striatal neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxic cell death.

Recently, several studies suggested that oxygen-dependent gene expression is of crucial importance in governing the essential steps of neurogenesis such as cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. In this context, we analysed the effect of the HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1) activation-mimicking agent CoCl(2) on MSCs. CoCl(2) treatment increased the expression of the anti-proliferative gene BTG2/PC3 and decreased cyclin D1 expression. Expression of HIF-1alpha and its target genes EPO, VEGF and p21 was also upregulated. These changes were followed by inhibition of cell proliferation and morphological changes resulting in neuron-like cells, which had increased neuronal marker expression and responded to neurotransmitters. Echinomycin, a molecule inhibiting HIF-1 DNA-binding activity, blocked the CoCl(2) effect on MSCs. Additionally, by using Y-27632, we demonstrated that Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibition potentiated CoCl(2)-induced MSC differentiation in particular into dopaminergic neuron-like cells as attested by its effect on tyrosine hydroxylase expression. Altogether, these results support the ability of MSCs to differentiate into neuron-like cells in response to CoCl(2), an effect that might act, in part, through HIF-1 activation and cell-cycle arrest, and which is potentiated by inhibition of ROCK.</AbstractText>"}

In many cases, the InsP3 receptor interacts with other signaling mechanisms that control levels of cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting that the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in normal cells could be controlled by the activity of the InsP3R. In support of this idea, recent studies show that altered InsP3 receptor activity can be partially responsible for Ca2+ dyshomeostasis seen in many neurodegenerative conditions.

Its neuroprotective activities occur as a consequence of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibition leading to downstream blockade of beta-catenin and Tau phosphorylation. In the present study, we investigated Li-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms in laboratory and murine human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) encephalitis (HIVE) models. In laboratory tests, Li protected neurons from neurotoxic secretions of HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). This neuroprotection was mediated, in part, through the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt and GSK-3beta pathways. To examine the effects of Li treatment in vivo, MDMs were injected into the basal ganglia of severe combined immunodeficient mice and then Li was administered (60 mg/kg/d). Seven days after MDM injection, mice were killed and CNS tissue was collected and subjected to immunocytochemical and Western blot assays for leukocyte and neural antigens, GSK-3beta, and key kinase substrates such as beta-catenin and Tau. Numbers of HIV-1 p24 antigen-positive MDMs were unaltered by Li treatment of HIVE mice. Similarly, the greatly increased extent of astrocyte and microglia activation in HIVE mice (10-fold and 16-fold, respectively, compared with unmanipulated controls) was also unaltered by Li. In contrast, Li restored HIVE-associated loss of microtubule-associated protein-2-positive neurites and synaptic density while reducing levels or activity of phospho-Tau Ser202, phospho-beta-catenin, and GSK-3beta. Electrophysiological recordings showed diminished long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices of HIVE mice that were restored by Li. Based on these data, the use of Li as an adjuvant for HIV-1-associated dementia is now being pursued.</AbstractText>"}

Wine is enriched in antioxidant compounds with potential neuroprotective activities. However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of wine intake on the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease brain remain to be clearly defined. Here we show that resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring polyphenol mainly found in grapes and red wine, markedly lowers the levels of secreted and intracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides produced from different cell lines. Resveratrol does not inhibit Abeta production, because it has no effect on the Abeta-producing enzymes beta- and gamma-secretases, but promotes instead intracellular degradation of Abeta via a mechanism that involves the proteasome. Indeed, the resveratrol-induced decrease of Abeta could be prevented by several selective proteasome inhibitors and by siRNA-directed silencing of the proteasome subunit beta5. These findings demonstrate a proteasome-dependent anti-amyloidogenic activity of resveratrol and suggest that this natural compound has a therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

It interacts with protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1) and with the polyglutamine-tract-binding protein 1 (PQBP1), which contributes to the pathogenesis of X-linked mental retardation and neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine tract expansions. We show here that SIPP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. Under basal circumstances SIPP1 was largely nuclear, but it accumulated in the cytoplasm following UV- or X-radiation. Nuclear import was mediated by two nuclear localization signals. In addition, SIPP1 could be piggy-back transported to the nucleus with its ligand PQBP1. In the nucleus SIPP1 and PQBP1 formed inclusion bodies similar to those detected in polyglutamine diseases. SIPP1 did not function as a nuclear targeting subunit of PP1 but re-localized nuclear PP1 to storage sites for splicing factors. The C-terminal residues of SIPP1, which do not conform to a classic nuclear export signal, were required for its nuclear export via the CMR-1 pathway. Finally, SIPP1 activated pre-mRNA splicing in intact cells, and the extent of splicing activation correlated with the nuclear concentration of SIPP1. We conclude that SIPP1 is a positive regulator of pre-mRNA splicing that is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. These findings also have potential implications for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of X-linked mental retardation and polyglutamine-linked neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

It is, therefore, essential to establish markers to identify subjects at risk before motor manifestation. A number of such 'premotor' signs have been discovered and investigated lately. Such signs include a genetic vulnerability and hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra as well as premotor symptoms like olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, depression, REM sleep behaviour disorder, visual and neuropsychological impairment. Moreover, first signs of affection of the substantia nigra like PET and SPECT abnormalities and slight motor signs can be included, as they may be detected before a definite diagnosis can be made. Although most of these signs and symptoms are unspecific if singularly evaluated a combination of these features may indeed be valuable to detect a subgroup of the population at risk for PD. However, future studies are necessary to establish the predictive value of these 'markers' singularly and in combination.</AbstractText>"}

Supplementum","Date":"2006","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>In neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, apoptosis is a common type of cell death, and mitochondria emerge as the major organelle to initiate death cascade. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the mitochondrial outer membrane produces hydrogen peroxide by oxidation of monoamine substrates, and induces oxidative stress resulting in neuronal degeneration. On the other hand, a series of inhibitors of type B MAO (MAO-B) protect neurons from cell death. These results suggest that MAO may be involved in the cell death process initiated in mitochondria. However, the direct involvement of MAO in the apoptotic signaling has been scarcely reported. In this paper, we present our recent results on the role of MAO in activating and regulating cell death processing in mitochondria. Type A MAO (MAO-A) was found to bind an endogenous dopaminergic neurotoxin, N-methyl(R)salsolinol, and induce apoptosis in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells containing only MAO-A. To examine the intervention of MAO-B in apoptotic process, human MAO-B cDNA was transfected to SH-SY5Y cells, but the sensitivity to N-methyl(R)salsolinol was not affected, even though the activity and protein of MAO-B were expressed markedly. MAO-B oxidized dopamine with production of hydrogen peroxide, whereas in control cells expressing only MAO-A, dopamine autoxidation produced superoxide and dopamine-quinone, and induced mitochondrial permeability transition and apoptosis. Rasagiline and other MAO-B inhibitors prevent the activation of apoptotic cascade and induce prosurvival genes, such as bcl-2 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, in MAO-A-containing cells. These results demonstrate a novel function of MAO-A in the induction and regulation of apoptosis. Future studies will clarify more detailed mechanism behind regulation of mitochondrial death signaling by MAO-A, and bring out new strategies to cure or ameliorate the decline of neurons in neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

This depletion causes the clinical hallmarks of this disease: bradykinesia, hypokinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. Besides these well known motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms may develop, such as hyposmia, sleep disorders, autonomic disturbances, depression, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms not only comprise Lewy body pathology in the central dopaminergic system, but also in the noradrenergic, serotinergic and cholinergic transmittersystems. Indeed, in Parkinson's disease, about 30-40% of the patients suffers fluctuating psychotic symptoms, mainly paranoid delusions and/or visual or acoustic hallucinations, symptoms considered to represent major contributors to patient and caregiver distress and nursing home placement. Endogenous (related to the disease process itself) as well as exogenous (related to therapeutical interventions) psychotogenic factors may contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms in PD. Therapeutical strategies, therefore, are aimed to reduce both endogenous and exogenous factors. To reduce endogenous psychotogenic factors, cholinesterase inhibitors, suggested to reduce cognitive deterioration, now seem to be the drugs of choice. In exogenously induced psychotic symptoms, atypical antipsychotics are considered the most effective.

Rivastigmine is a powerful slow-reversible, noncompetitive carbamate cholinesterase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months duration have shown beneficial effects of rivastigmine compared with placebo in measures of cognition and global functioning. Less rigorous but growing data suggest that the beneficial effects may endure for up to 5 years, extend to more advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and may occur in noncognitive domains, such as activities of daily living and the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Evidence from controlled studies also supports the use of rivastigmine for cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease associated with vascular risk factors, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Early and continued treatment of Alzheimer's disease with rivastigmine maximizes the observed beneficial effects. The most prominent adverse effect of rivastigmine is centrally mediated cholinergic gastrointestinal events, which can be minimized by slower dose-escalation intervals and administration with a full meal. Therapeutic dosing is 6-12 mg/day given twice daily, with higher doses having the potential for greater benefits.</AbstractText>"}

The goal of the current study was to determine if aging affects the ability of microglia to divide during the early response to facial nerve axotomy. In addition, we investigated the incidence of microglial cell death during later post-axotomy time points to determine if aging had an effect on microglial turnover. We employed DNA labeling with 3H-thymidine, TUNEL and lectin histochemistry after facial nerve axotomy in young (3 months), middle-aged (15 months), and old (30 months) Fisher344-Brown Norway hybrid rats. Proliferation of microglia in old rats remained significantly higher than in young rats 4 days after injury, suggesting that regulation of microglial proliferation changes with aging. There was no aging-related difference in microglial TUNEL staining at 7, 14 or 21 days post-axotomy. Lectin histochemistry in the unoperated facial nucleus revealed aging-related morphological changes in resting microglia, including hypertrophy of the cytoplasm with dense perinuclear staining. Aging-related differences in activated microglia on the lesioned side were more subtle, although many activated microglia of aged animals continued to exhibit dense perinuclear lectin reactivity. We propose that aging-related changes in morphology in conjunction with a less regulated proliferative response in the aged facial nucleus may be a reflection of microglial senescence.</AbstractText>"}

To further understand PD, researchers have developed standardized animal models of PD. In this study, Long Evans (LE) rats were unilaterally lesioned by injection of the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) of the left hemisphere. The rats were divided into three groups randomly; group 1 (runners) were housed in individual cages with attached running wheels, group 2 (stressed-runners) had access to individual free running wheels, except post-lesion when the rats were subjected to immobilization of the running wheel for 1 h per day for 14 days, as well as one session of 24-h food deprivation and a 7-h shift in the light/dark cycle. Group 3 (non-runnners) were housed individually in cages with attached running wheels that were permanently immobilized. Subcutaneous injection of the DA agonist, apomorphine, caused stressed-runners and non-runners to rotate vigorously away from the side of the lesion (contralaterally). Apomorphine-induced rotations provide a behavioural measure of the extent of the lesion, a depletion of more than 80% of DA neurons is required to produce vigorous contralateral rotations in response to apomorphine injection. Runners rotated significantly less than non-runners and stressed-runners. The number of rotations performed by stressed-runners was not significantly different from non-runners, suggesting that stress had cancelled the neuroprotective effect of running. Immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase in the SNc revealed slightly less destruction of DA neurons in the runners than in stressed-runners or non-runners, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. The behavioural results confirm a previous finding suggesting that voluntary exercise is neuroprotective. A novel finding is that mild stressors cancel the neuroprotection afforded by voluntary exercise.</AbstractText>"}

In the present work, we described the development and evaluation of a highly sensitive and selective capillary liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry method for quantitatively analyzing Acro-dG in DNA hydrolysates. This was achieved by applying a stable isotope-labeled analogue Acro-dG-13C10,15N5 as an internal standard to the DNA to be analyzed and then hydrolyzing the DNA enzymatically to nucleosides. The acrolein-modified nucleosides were separated from normal nucleosides by capillary liquid chromatography and quantified by a high-capacity ion trap mass spectrometer in the MS/MS mode. The developed method achieved attomole-level sensitivity (limit of detection was 10 fg, 31 amol on column) for detection of pure Acro-dG adduct standards. The limit of quantification of Acro-dG adducts obtained in 10 mug of DNA hydrolysates was 1.5 fmol, which corresponded to 50 adducts/10(9) normal nucleosides. Application of this method to the analysis of Acro-dG adducts in acrolein (10-fold)-treated calf thymus DNA showed approximately 830 lesion/10(6) DNA nucleosides using as low as 50 ng of DNA. Application of this method to DNA samples (1-2 mug) isolated from brain tissues from Alzheimer's disease subjects and age-matched controls demonstrated 2800-5100 Acro-dG adducts/10(9) DNA nucleosides.

In the present study, we examined the biological effects of NO and its mechanisms in human malignant glioblastoma cells. Addition of a NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), induced apoptosis in U87MG human glioblastoma cells, accompanied by opening mitochondrial permeability transition pores, release of cytochrome c and AIF, and subsequently by caspase activation. NO-induced apoptosis occurred concurrently with significantly increased levels of the Bak and Bim. Treatment with SNAP resulted in sustained activation of JNK and its downstream pathway, c-Jun/AP-1. The expression of dominant-negative (DN)-JNK1 and DN-c-Jun suppressed the activation of AP-1, the induction of Bak and Bim, and the SNAP-induced apoptosis. In addition, de novo protein synthesis was required for the initiation of apoptosis in that the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), inhibited NO-induced apoptotic cell death as well as up-regulation of Bak and Bim. These results suggest that NO activates an apoptotic cascade, involving sustained JNK activation, AP-1 DNA binding activity, and subsequent Bak and Bim induction, followed by cytochrome c and AIF releases and caspases cascade activation, resulting in human malignant brain tumor cell death.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

With increasing doses of L-dopa, locomotor activity increased and motor disability declined. The duration of dyskinesia following L-dopa administration increased dose-dependently, and showed a linear correlation with total locomotor activity. In addition, the time-course of dyskinesia paralleled closely that of locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, severity of dyskinesia showed a non-linear correlation with total locomotor activity, low doses of L-dopa eliciting severe dyskinesia for short periods of time. The threshold for dyskinesia induction and the antiparkinsonian effects of L-dopa appear very similar in primed MPTP primates mimicking late stage PD. Reducing individual doses of L-dopa to avoid severe dyskinesia can markedly compromise the antiparkinsonian response.

Prions have been shown to be present in blood by transfusion experiments, but based on the amount of infectivity found in these types of experiments, the amount of misfolded prion protein in blood is estimated to be only 30 to 625 amol/mL. More sensitive detection of prions in brain would allow earlier detection of disease and assure a safer food supply. We studied quantitation of the prion protein by use of nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer using the multiple reaction monitoring mode of operation. We developed a method based on the detection of VVEQMCTTQYQK obtained by reduction, alkylation, and digestion with trypsin of the prion protein. Detection of VVEQMCTTQYQK was more sensitive than for the derivative with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) because of decreased ionization efficiency of the PITC-derivatized peptides.

The copper chaperone for SOD1, CCS, is responsible for intracellular copper loading in SOD1 under most physiological conditions. Recent in vitro and in vivo assays reveal that CCS not only delivers copper to SOD1 under stringent copper limitation, but it also facilitates the stepwise conversion of the disulfide-reduced immature SOD1 to the active disulfide-containing enzyme. The two new functions attributed to CCS, (i.e., O(2)-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase- and disulfide isomerase-like activities) indicate that this protein has attributes of the larger class of molecular chaperones. The CCS-dependent activation of SOD1 is dependent upon oxygen availability, suggesting that the cell only loads copper and activates this enzyme when O(2)-based oxidative stress is present. Thiol/disulfide status as well as metallation state of SOD1 significantly affects its structure and protein aggregation, which are relevant in pathologies of a neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Disease age of onset is correlated with the polyQ insert length above a critical value of 35-40 glutamines. The aggregation kinetics of isolated polyQ peptides in vitro also shows a similar critical-length dependence. While recent experimental work has provided considerable insights into polyQ aggregation, the molecular mechanism of aggregation is not well understood. Here, using computer simulations of isolated polyQ peptides, we show that a mechanism of aggregation is the conformational transition in a single polyQ peptide chain from random coil to a parallel beta-helix. This transition occurs selectively in peptides longer than 37 glutamines. In the beta-helices observed in simulations, all residues adopt beta-strand backbone dihedral angles, and the polypeptide chain coils around a central helical axis with 18.5 +/- 2 residues per turn. We also find that mutant polyQ peptides with proline-glycine inserts show formation of antiparallel beta-hairpins in their ground state, in agreement with experiments. The lower stability of mutant beta-helices explains their lower aggregation rates compared to wild type. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for polyQ-mediated aggregation.</AbstractText>"}

In simulations of 20-, 40-, and 80-mer polyQ, we observed the formation of the 'alpha-extended chain' conformation, which is characterized by alternating residues in the alpha(L) and alpha(R) conformations to yield a sheet. The structural transition from disordered random-coil conformations to the alpha-extended chain conformation exhibits modest length and temperature dependence, in agreement with the experimental observation that aggregation depends on length and temperature. We propose that fibril formation in polyQ may occur through an alpha-sheet structure, which was proposed by Pauling and Corey. Also, we propose an atomic-resolution model of how the inhibitory peptide QBP1 (polyQ-binding peptide 1) may bind to polyQ in an alpha-extended chain conformation to inhibit fibril formation.</AbstractText>"}

Here we report that only prion-infected neuronal cells become apoptotic after mild inhibition of the proteasome, and this is strictly dependent upon sustained propagation of PrP(Sc). Whereas cells overexpressing PrP(C) developed cytosolic PrP(C) aggregates, this did not cause cell death. In contrast, only in prion-infected cells, mild proteasome impairment resulted in the formation of large cytosolic perinuclear aggresomes that contained PrP(Sc), heat shock chaperone 70, ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, and vimentin. Similar structures were found in the brains of prion-infected mice. PrP(Sc) aggresome formation was directly associated with activation of caspase 3 and 8, resulting in apoptosis. These data suggest that neuronal propagation of prions invokes a neurotoxic mechanism involving intracellular formation of PrP(Sc) aggresomes. This, in turn, triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis and further implicates proteasome dysfunction in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.</AbstractText>"}

However, the anti-inflammatory effect of EGCG on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of EGCG in attenuating the inflammatory response induced by interleukin (IL)-1beta+beta-amyloid (25-35) fragment (Abeta) in human astrocytoma, U373MG cells. EGCG significantly inhibited the IL-1beta+Abeta (25-35)-induced IL-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prostaglandin (PG)E(2) production at 24 h (P&lt;.01). The maximal inhibition rate of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and PGE(2) production by EGCG was approximately 54.40%, 56.01%, 69.06% and 47.03%, respectively. EGCG also attenuated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB induced by IL-1beta+Abeta (25-35). We demonstrated that EGCG suppresses IL-1beta+Abeta (25-35)-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In addition, EGCG induced the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1.

It has been suggested that this pathway can be involved in generation of cognitive deficits associated with normal aging. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that aged rats presented recognition memory deficits. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of memantine, a low-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, on age-induced recognition memory deficits. Additionally, parameters of oxidative damage in cerebral regions related to memory formation were evaluated. In order to do that, male Wistar rats (24 months old) received daily injections of saline solution or memantine (20 mg/kg i.p.) during 21 days. The animals were submitted to a novel object recognition task 1 week after the last injection. Memantine-treated rats showed normal recognition memory while the saline group showed long-term recognition memory deficits. The results show that memantine is able to reverse age-induced recognition memory deficits. We also demonstrated that memantine reduced the oxidative damage to proteins in cortex and hippocampus, two important brain regions involved in memory formation. Thus, the present findings suggest that, at least in part, age-induced cognitive deficits are related to oxidative damage promoted by NMDA receptor overactivation.</AbstractText>"}

Up to now, the main focus of ammonia toxicity has been on astrocytes and neurons.

In the present study, we found that ammonia triggered mitosis at concentrations between 30 microm and 3.0 mm but apoptosis at concentrations &gt;or= 1.0 mm in the murine microglial cell line BV-2. Most apoptotic cells showed an accumulation of condensed chromatin at the nuclear envelope, blebbing of the plasma membrane, formation of apoptotic bodies and an increase in caspase 3/7 activity. Blockade of caspase 3/7 activity by Ac-DEVD-CHO suppressed ammonia-induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, some BV-2 cells exposed to ammonia displayed clear signs of mitotic catastrophe, a type of cell death occurring during mitosis. In a further series of experiments, we found that cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) mediated the apoptogenic effects of ammonia, because (i) ammonia dose-dependently elevated the intracellular cAMP level, (ii) blockade of the adenylyl cyclase by SQ-22536 suppressed ammonia-induced apoptosis, (iii) inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) by the nonselective PDE inhibitor IBMX, or by the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram, increased the relative number of apoptotic cells, and (iv) the cAMP analogues 8-bromoadenosine cAMP and Sp-cAMP mimicked the effect of ammonia and triggered apoptosis.

Their uptake into brain from the circulation is initiated by nucleoside transporters located at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the rate at which uptake occurs is a major factor determining phosphatide synthesis. Two such transporters have been described: a low-affinity equilibrative system and a high-affinity concentrative system. It is unlikely that the low-affinity transporter contributes to brain uridine or cytidine uptake except when plasma concentrations of these compounds are increased several-fold experimentally. CNT2 proteins, the high-affinity transporters for purines like adenosine as well as for uridine, have been found in cells comprising the BBB of rats. However, to date, no comparable high-affinity carrier protein for cytidine, such as CNT1, has been detected at this location. Thus, uridine may be more available to brain than cytidine and may be the major precursor in brain for both the salvage pathway of pyrimidine nucleotides and the Kennedy pathway of phosphatide synthesis. This recognition may bear on the effects of cytidine or uridine sources in neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, we resolved this paradox by showing that the C. elegans 'Mit mutants' only exhibit life extension in a defined window of mitochondrial dysfunction. Similar to humans, when mitochondrial dysfunction becomes too severe these mutants also exhibit pathogenic life reduction. We have proposed that life extension in the Mit mutants occurs as a by-product of compensatory processes specifically activated to maintain mitochondrial function.

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo). Brain damage and neurological deficit 24 h after MCAo were exacerbated by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. This exacerbation was critically dependent on interleukin (IL)-1, because coadministration of IL-1 receptor antagonist abolished the effect of LPS on brain damage. Systemic administration of IL-1 increased ischemic damage to a similar extent as LPS and also exacerbated brain edema. IL-1 markedly potentiated circulating levels of the acute phase proteins, serum amyloid A and IL-6, and the neutrophil-selective CXC chemokines, KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. Neutrophil mobilization and cortical neutrophil infiltration were aggravated by IL-1 before changes in ischemic damage. Neutropenia abolished the damaging effects of systemic IL-1. These data show for the first time that an acute systemic inflammatory stimulus is detrimental to outcome after experimental stroke and highlight IL-1 as a critical mediator in this paradigm. Our data suggest IL-1-induced potentiation of neutrophil mobilization via CXC chemokine induction is a putative mechanism underlying this effect.

Replacement of any residue (except Pro(357)) in the domain with alanine activated Cl(-) currents. Substitution of Pro(357) with other amino acids, especially phenylalanine, did activate currents. Membrane biotinylation demonstrated that nonfunctional mBest3 protein was trafficked to the plasma membrane, implying that the AI domain inhibited channel gating but not trafficking. mBest3-F359A and hBest3-G361A mutations induced outwardly rectifying currents, suggesting that the AI domain is associated with the channel pore or gating mechanism. Supporting this suggestion, the mBest3 AI domain was demonstrated to be located within a membrane-associated region. When the wild-type mBest3 C terminus (amino acids 292-669) was expressed in HEK293 cells, the protein was located mainly in the particulate fraction, but it became soluble when a sequence containing the AI domain was deleted (Delta353-404).

Genetic causes of AD are known only for early-onset AD patients. For a majority of late-onset AD patients, causal factors are still unknown. Currently, there are no early detectable biomarkers for late-onset AD, and there is a lack of understanding of AD pathophysiology, particularly at the early stages of disease progression, before pathology develops. Human histopathological and biochemical studies provide valuable information regarding the last stages of AD pathogenesis. However, to understand early cellular changes in AD progression before symptoms develop, animal models are still our only alternative. Several research groups have created genetically engineered animal models, particularly models of the mouse, rat, fly, and worm, which have allowed us to better, understand the initiating events of AD progression. Recently, state-of-the-art methods have helped elucidate gene expression changes in affected and unaffected tissues from postmortem AD brains and from animal models developed for AD studies. These methods allow the investigation of mRNA-based transcriptosomal profiles of brain specimens from AD humans and transgenic animals. The major finding from these studies is that AD progression and pathogenesis involve multiple cellular pathways, which suggests that AD is a complex and heterogeneous disease.</AbstractText>"}

Structural alterations of HDL may affect their functional and atheroprotective properties. Oxidants, such as hypochlorous acid, peroxyl radicals, metal ions, peroxynitrite, lipoxygenases and smoke extracts, can alter both surface and core components of HDL. The formation of lipid peroxidation derivatives, such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and aldehydes, is associated with changes of physical properties (fluidity, molecular order) and of apoprotein conformation. Non-enzymatic glycation, generally associated with lipoxidation, leads to form irreversible complexes called advanced glycation end products. These HDL modifications are accompanied with altered biological activities of HDL and associated enzymes, including paraoxonase, CETP and LCAT. Homocysteine-induced modification of HDL is mediated by homocysteine-thiolactone, and can be prevented by a calcium-dependent thiolactonase/paraoxonase. Tyrosylation of HDL induces the formation of dimers and trimers of apo AI, and alters cholesterol efflux. Phospholipases and proteolytic enzymes can also modify HDL lipid and apoprotein structure. HDL modification induces generally the loss of their anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. This could play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

These neurons are particularly sensitive to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which causes parkinsonian syndromes in humans, monkeys and rodents. Although apoptotic cell death has been implicated in MPTP/MPP+ toxicity, several recent studies have challenged the role of caspase-dependent apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. Using the midbrain-derived MN9D dopaminergic cell line, we found that MPP+ treatment resulted in an active form of cell death that could not be prevented by caspase inhibitors or over-expression of a dominant negative inhibitor of apoptotic protease activating factor 1/caspase-9. Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial protein that may mediate caspase-independent forms of regulated cell death following its translocation to the nucleus. We found that MPP+ treatment elicited nuclear translocation of AIF accompanied by large-scale DNA fragmentation. To establish the role of AIF in MPP+ toxicity, we constructed a DNA vector encoding a short hairpin sequence targeted against AIF. Reduction of AIF expression by RNA interference inhibited large-scale DNA fragmentation and conferred significant protection against MPP+ toxicity. Studies of primary mouse midbrain cultures further supported a role for AIF in caspase-independent cell death in MPP+-treated dopaminergic neurons.</AbstractText>"}

However, contrary to previous reports, in the present study we have found that PrP exhibits no detectable dismutase activity above baseline levels measured for copper (II) ions in water when assayed using a reliable procedure with a detection limit of at least 2 units of activity/mg of protein. This was true when the assay was performed with either PrP refolded from a denatured state in the presence of copper, as in previous studies, or native PrP loaded with copper.

Autopsied midbrain tissues of a PD patient were sliced in 3 mm thickness and then examined using synchrotron X-rays from the 7B2 beamline of the Pohang Light Source. Refraction-enhanced phase contrast radiography and microtomography were adopted to identify dark core and dim edge of Lewy bodies in neurons. The morphology of Lewy bodies was clearly revealed by the phase contrast radiography in very thick (3 mm) midbrain tissues without any staining treatment. Three-dimensional volume rendered microtomography of the autopsied midbrain tissues demonstrates striking evidence that several Lewy bodies are agglomerated by dim edges in a neuron.

The present results showed that a cellular damage occurred as early as 4 h after QA infusion coincident with an increase in the ROS contents, which returned to control levels after 24 h, while the cellular damage persisted for 72 h. There was a marked increased in the total antioxidant capacity at 8 h after QA infusion in both reactivity and potential levels. By 72 h post-treatment, the TRAP levels decreased, but the TAR levels remained augmented. Therefore, the delayed and persistent increase in the antioxidant capacity after QA insult may be a cellular adaptative response, probably contributing to decrease the ROS levels in order to prevent the spreading of the cellular damage. Therefore, the increase in the QA level in the brain ventricle may induce oxidative stress, which is followed by a persistent response in the antioxidant system in the hippocampus. The present study may, therefore, contribute to elucidate the mechanism of the brain dysfunction in patients with several neurological disorders involving elevation of QA in the CSF.</AbstractText>"}

Human apoE has three common isoforms, each with different risk implications for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Neither the structure of lipoprotein E particles nor the structural consequences of the isoform differences are known. In this investigation, synthetic lipoprotein particles were prepared by complexing phospholipids with full-length apoE isoforms, or with truncated N-terminal and C-terminal domains of apoE. These particles were examined with calorimetry, electron microscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and internal reflection infrared spectroscopy. Results indicate that particles made with the three full-length apoE isoforms are discoidal in shape, and structurally indistinguishable. Thus, differences in their pathological consequences are not due to gross differences in particle structure. Although apoE is predominantly helical, and the axes of the helices are parallel to the flat surfaces of the particles, the orientational order of lipid acyl chains is low and inconsistent with the belt model of lipoprotein A-I structure. Instead, the data suggest that there are at least two different types of apoE-lipid interactions within lipoprotein E particles. One type occurs between apoE helices and the edge of the lipid bilayer as in the belt model, while a second type involves apoE helices that situate in the plane of the membrane and disturb acyl chain order. These interactions allow LpE particles to form with different protein/lipid ratios, and they account for the structure of LpE particles made with only the truncated domains.</AbstractText>"}

We report a rapid induction of p53 and increased expression of p21, concurrent with reduced levels of many cell cycle proteins that regulate G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. However, we found increased levels of cdk2 and cyclin E, and formation of a cyclin E-cdk2-p21 protein complex. DNA damage failed to induce activation and progression of the cell cycle.

NMDA-triggered GSK3beta activation was mediated by NMDAR that contained the NR2B subunit. Interestingly, GSK3beta inhibition reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of the PP1 inhibitor 2 (I2) and attenuated serine 9 dephosphorylation by PP1. These data suggest existence of a feedback loop between GSK3beta and PP1 that results in amplification of PP1 activation by GSK3beta.

Conversely, overexpression of GSK3beta abolished non-NR2B-mediated activation of CRE-driven transcription. These data suggest that cross-talk between GSK3beta and PP1 contributes to NR2B NMDAR-induced inhibition of CREB signaling by non-NR2B NMDAR.

Activation of iNOS and NO generation has come to be accepted as a marker and therapeutic target in neuroinflammatory conditions such as those observed in ischemia, multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and inherited peroxisomal (e.g. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; X-ALD) and lysosomal disorders (e.g. Krabbe's disease). However, with the emergence of reports on the neuroprotective facets of NO, the prior dogma about NO being solely detrimental has had to be modified. While RNSs such as peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) have been linked to lipid peroxidation, neuronal/oligodendrocyte loss, and demyelination in neurodegenerative diseases, limited NO generation by GSNO has been found to promote vasodilation and attenuate vascular injury under the same ischemic conditions. NO generated from GSNO acts as second messenger molecular which through S-nitrosylation has been shown to control important cellular processes by regulation of expression/activity of certain proteins such as NF-kappaB. It is now believed that the environment and the context in which NO is produced largely determines the actions (good or bad) of this molecule. These multi-faceted aspects of NO make therapeutic interference with iNOS activity even more complicated since complete ablation of iNOS activity has been found to be rather more detrimental than protective in most neurodegenerative conditions. Investigators in search of iNOS modulating pharmacological agents have realized the need of a delicate balance so as to allow the production of physiologically relevant amounts of NO (such as those required for host defence/neutotransmission/vasodilation, etc.) but at the same time block the generation of RNSs through repressing excessive NO levels (such as those causing neuronal/tissue damage and demyelination, etc.). The past years have seen a noteworthy increase in novel agents that might prove useful in achieving the aim of harnessing the good and blocking the undesirable actions of NO. It is the aim of this review to provide basic insights into the NOS family of enzymes with special emphasis of the role of iNOS in the CNS, in the first part.

To understand the role of the GAV motif in protein amyloidogenesis, we studied the effects of the homologous peptides corresponding to the sequence of GAV motif region (residues 66-74) on alpha-Syn aggregation.

The acceleration of alpha-Syn aggregation by the homologous peptides is under a sequence-specific manner.

However, the regulation of the expression of CHIP under different stress conditions and its protective role thereon is unknown. Here we have shown that the mRNA level of CHIP is significantly increased in the cells exposed to oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum and proteasomal stress. CHIP also protected from various stress-induced cell death. Finally, we have demonstrated upregulation of CHIP mRNA levels in the expanded polyglutamine protein expressing cells. Our result suggests that the upregulation of CHIP under various stress environments is an adaptive response of the cells to deal with the excess burden of misfolded protein.</AbstractText>"}

Parkinsonism in DLB is mainly caused by neuronal loss with Lewy bodies (LBs) in the substantia nigra, thereby inducing degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway similar to that in Parkinson's disease (PD). To clarify the pathogenesis of DLB, it is important to investigate the mechanisms involved in the degenerative process of LB-bearing neurones. Several reports suggest a role for nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) in the manifestation of neurodegenerative conditions such as AD and PD. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether NFkappaB subunits are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in DLB by measuring tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), NFkappaB p65 and p50 protein expression in frontal cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta of DLB and control human brains. An increase, although not statistically significant, in nigral TH expression in DLB cases was observed. There were no differences in the cortical and nigral expression levels of NFkappaB p65 subunit between control and DLB cases. Western blots of the frontal cortex showed no differences in the expression levels of NFkappaB p50 subunit. However, NFkappaB p50 levels were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra in the DLB cases in comparison with controls. The decrease in the expression of the p50 subunit in the substantia nigra of DLB cases achieved in the present study may increase the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurones to a possible neurotoxic effect of p65 subunit. Thus, normal levels of NFkappaB p65 might be toxic in neurones with a low expression of the NFkappaB p50 subunit.</AbstractText>"}

Despite these broad neuroimmune activities linked to specific environmental cues, a precise cellular genetic profile for microglia in the context of disease and repair has not been elucidated. To this end we used nucleic acid microarrays, proteomics, immunochemical and histochemical tests to profile microglia in neuroprotective immune responses. Optic and sciatic nerve (ON and SN) fragments were used to stimulate microglia in order to reflect immune consequences of nervous system injury. Lipopolysaccharide and latex beads-induced microglial activation served as positive controls. Cytosolic and secreted proteins were profiled by surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) ProteinChip, 1D and 2D difference gel electrophoresis. Proteins were identified by peptide sequencing with tandem mass spectrometry, ELISA and western blot tests. Temporal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antioxidants, neurotrophins, and lysosomal enzyme expression provided, for the first time, a unique profile of secreted microglia proteins with neuroregulatory functions. Most importantly, this molecular and biochemical signature supports a broad range of microglial functions for debris clearance and promotion of neural repair after injury.</AbstractText>"}

The therapeutic use of anti-inflammatory agents may reduce certain central nervous system pathology induced by inflammatory responses. We investigated the role of interleukin (IL)-4 in modulating the production of proinflammatory mediators from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mixed glia in vitro. Interestingly, IL-4 significantly enhanced IL-1beta secretion and did not affect monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 release, even though IL-4 considerably inhibited IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nitric oxide production from rat neonatal mixed glia. Further, IL-4 exhibited inhibitory effects on IL-1beta production in microglial-enriched cultures, while significantly increasing IL-1beta production in microglial-depleted glia. The enhancing effect of IL-4 on IL-1beta production was found to be inversely correlated with the percentage of microglia present in the mixed glial population. In summary, IL-4 did not act as a global anti-inflammatory cytokine and in fact, under certain situations enhanced IL-1beta secretion. We conclude that IL-4 exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in a limited and target-specific manner, which is delicately regulated by the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, precaution should be taken when clinically using IL-4 to treat diseases manifested by overt inflammatory responses.</AbstractText>"}

Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster strains were developed to express highly structured RNA under control of a heat shock promoter. Expression of a specific construct strongly perturbed fly behavior, caused significant decline in learning and memory retention of adult males, and was coincident with the formation of intracellular congophilic aggregates in the brain and other tissues of adult and larval stages. Additionally, neuronal cell pathology of adult flies was similar to that observed in human Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. This novel model demonstrates that expression of a specific highly structured RNA alone is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration, possibly through chaperone-like facilitation of protein misfolding and aggregation.</AbstractText>"}

As copper accumulation in the brain leads to disturbances in basal ganglia function, neurological-type patients typically present with hypo- and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal symptoms, with Parkinsonism being very common. Although there are numerous reports on olfactory deficits in primary neurodegenerative disorders, olfactory function has not been investigated in metabolic disorders presenting with extrapyramidal features. Twenty-four patients with Wilson's disease participated in the investigation. All patients were treated pharmacologically. They comprised patients with liver disease alone (including mild enzyme elevation in asymptomatic individuals; n = 11) and/or neurological symptoms (n = 13) at the time of testing. Twenty-one patients underwent both [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was judged using a clinical score system ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). In all patients, psychophysical testing was performed using the Sniffin' Sticks, which involved tests for odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Results from the present study revealed that Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms show a significant olfactory dysfunction compared to hepatic-type patients. Individuals who are more severely neurologically affected also present with a more pronounced olfactory deficit. Of interest, there was no significant effect of long-term treatment with penicillamine on olfactory function. Olfactory function did not correlate significantly with the presence of MRI visible lesions in the basal ganglia or with any regional glucose metabolism as measured by [18]F-FDG-PET. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the underlying pathological alterations with degeneration in the basal ganglia and neuronal loss in association with a marked increase of the copper content in this brain region play a role in the olfactory deficit.</AbstractText>"}

Considerable evidence suggests that reduced exposure of tissue to IGF-I is associated with an extended lifespan in these species. In humans, IGF-I is linked to various age-related diseases that are limiting factors for youthful longevity. On one hand, reduced IGF-I activity is associated with significant morbidity in adulthood with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, elevated IGF-I levels have been linked to cancer risk given the role of IGF in mediating normal and malignant tissue growth. Thus, IGF is clearly involved in modulating disease of aging; however, the mechanism appears to be complex and interdependent on additional modulating factors. It is attractive to hypothesize that maximal human survival depends on tight regulation of the GH-IGF axis and maintenance of optimal IGF-I action in order to prevent morbidities associated with either deficient or excessive state. Specifically, it is possible that lower levels of IGF-I during early adulthood followed by higher levels of IGF-I later in life may be most beneficial for human longevity by addressing age-specific morbidities.</AbstractText>"}

Although a number of association studies have been performed in an effort to find genetic components of sporadic ALS, most of them resulted in inconsistent findings due to a small number of genes investigated in relatively small sample sizes, while the replication of results was rarely attempted. Defects in retrograde axonal transport, vesicle trafficking and xenobiotic metabolism have been implicated in neurodegeneration and motor neuron death both in human disease and animal models. To assess the role of common genetic variation in these pathways in susceptibility to sporadic ALS, we performed a pathway-based candidate gene case-control association study with replication. Furthermore, we determined reliability of whole genome amplified DNA in a large-scale association study. In the first stage of the study, 1277 putative functional and tagging SNPs in 134 genes spanning 8.7 Mb were genotyped in 822 British sporadic ALS patients and 872 controls using whole genome amplified DNA. To detect variants with modest effect size and discriminate among false positive findings 19 SNPs showing a trend of association in the initial screen were genotyped in a replication sample of 580 German sporadic ALS patients and 361 controls. We did not detect strong evidence of association with any of the genes investigated in the discovery sample (lowest uncorrected P-value 0.00037, lowest permutation corrected P-value 0.353). None of the suggestive associations was replicated in a second sample, further excluding variants with moderate effect size. We conclude that common variation in the investigated pathways is unlikely to have a major effect on susceptibility to sporadic ALS. The genotyping efficiency was only slightly decreased ( approximately 1%) and genotyping quality was not affected using whole genome amplified DNA. It is reliable for large scale genotyping studies of diseases such as ALS, where DNA sample collections are limited because of low disease prevalence and short survival time.</AbstractText>"}

Presynaptic uptake of choline via the sodium-dependent, hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter (CHT) is believed to sustain acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and release. Analysis of this hypothesis in vivo is limited in mammals because of the toxicity of CHT antagonists and the early postnatal lethality of CHT-/- mice (Ferguson et al., 2004). In Caenorhabditis elegans, in which cholinergic signaling supports motor activity and mutant alleles impacting ACh secretion and response can be propagated, we investigated the contribution of CHT (CHO-1) to facets of cholinergic neurobiology. Using the cho-1 promoter to drive expression of a translational, green fluorescent protein-CHO-1 fusion (CHO-1:GFP) in wild-type and kinesin (unc-104) mutant backgrounds, we establish in the living nematode that the transporter localizes to cholinergic synapses, and likely traffics on synaptic vesicles. Using embryonic primary cultures, we demonstrate that CHO-1 mediates hemicholinium-3-sensitive, high-affinity choline uptake that can be enhanced with depolarization in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner supporting ACh synthesis. Although homozygous cho-1 null mutants are viable, they possess 40% less ACh than wild-type animals and display stress-dependent defects in motor activity. In a choline-free liquid environment, cho-1 mutants demonstrate premature paralysis relative to wild-type animals. Our findings establish a requirement for presynaptic choline transport activity in vivo in a model amenable to a genetic dissection of CHO-1 regulation.</AbstractText>"}

This disorder has been recently linked to a loss of hypocretin (HCRT) neurons making narcolepsy a neurodegenerative disease. Neuronal replacement could be used to reverse the symptoms of narcolepsy. Towards this end, we have recently reported that HCRT neurons from rat pups can survive when grafted into the pons of adult rats. Here, we investigate the time-course of survival of grafted HCRT neurons into the pons of adult rats. The HCRT neurons are present only in the lateral hypothalamus, and therefore suspension of cells from this region was derived from 8- to 10-day-old rat pups (donor), and grafted into the pons of adult (60 days old) host rats. Control rats received a transplant that consisted of cells from the cerebellum where no HCRT neurons are present. All adult host rats were sacrificed 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, or 36 days after grafting. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify and count the presence of the HCRT grafted neurons in the target area. The tally of HCRT neurons present in the graft zone 1 day post-grafting was considered to be the baseline. From day 3 to 36 post-transplant there was a steady decline in the number of HCRT neurons. We also noted that on day 36, the HCRT neurons that survived in the pons had morphological features that were similar to mature HCRT neurons in the adult lateral hypothalamus, suggesting that these neurons might be functionally active. Control rats that received grafts of cerebellar tissue did not show HCRT neurons in the target area. These results demonstrate that there is a progressive decline in the number of transplanted neurons, but a significant percentage of HCRT neurons do survive until day 36. This study highlights the potential use of transplants as a therapeutical tool in order to treat narcolepsy.</AbstractText>"}

In rats, selective cholinergic BF lesions or fiber-sparing EC lesions may induce memory deficits, but most often of weak magnitude. This study investigated, in adult rats, the effects on activity and memory of both lesions, alone or in combination, using 192 IgG-saporin (OX7-saporin as a control) and L-N-methyl-D-aspartate to destroy BF and EC neurons, respectively. Rats were tested for locomotor activity in their home cage and for working- and/or reference-memory in various tasks (water maze, Hebb-Williams maze, radial maze). Only rats with combined lesions showed diurnal and nocturnal hyperactivity. EC lesions impaired working memory and induced anterograde memory deficits in almost all tasks. Lesions of BF cholinergic neurons induced more limited deficits: reference memory was impaired in the probe trial of the water-maze task and in the radial maze. When both lesions were combined, performance never improved in the water maze and the number of errors in the Hebb-Williams and the radial mazes was always larger than in any other group. These results (i) indicate synergistic implications of BF and EC in memory function, (ii) suggest that combined BF cholinergic and fiber-sparing EC lesions may model aspects of anterograde memory deficits and restlessness as seen in AD, (iii) challenge the cholinergic hypothesis of cognitive dysfunctions in AD, and (iv) contribute to open theoretical views on AD-related memory dysfunctions going beyond the latter hypothesis.</AbstractText>"}

Specific transporters take up metals at the apical surface and export them at the basolateral surface, and are involved in their intracellular distribution. Transporters for each of the major essential metals, calcium, iron and zinc, have been identified. These transporters also mediate the transport of non-essential metals across tight membrane barriers. For example, the intestinal iron transporter divalent metal transporter 1 mediates the uptake of lead and cadmium. The levels of essential metals are strictly regulated by transporters. When dietary levels of essential metals are low, levels of the corresponding transporters increase in the intestine, after which there is a greater potential for increased transport of toxic metals. In the brain, the strict regulation of metals prevents injury that potentially would result from oxidative damage induced by the essential metals iron, copper and zinc. Indeed, the oxidative damage found in neurodegenerative diseases is likely to be due to higher levels of these metals. Involvement of intracellular transporters for copper and zinc has been shown in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, raising the possibility that higher levels of iron, zinc and copper might be due to a disruption in the activity of transporters. Accordingly, exposure to toxicants that affect the activity of transporters potentially could contribute to the aetiology/progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We found that melatonin at pharmacological concentrations, but not at physiological concentrations, suppressed epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated NSC proliferation (increment of viable cells, DNA synthesis and neurosphere formation) in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with melatonin at a pharmacological concentration during the proliferation period facilitated 1% FBS-induced neural differentiation of NSCs without affecting the astroglial differentiation. In contrast, the treatment with melatonin at pharmacological concentrations during the differentiation period decreased the neural differentiation of the NSCs. As with melatonin, MCI-186, an antioxidant, suppressed EGF-stimulated NSC proliferation and facilitated the subsequent neural differentiation of NSCs. These results suggest that melatonin exerts potent modulatory effects on NSC functions including the suppression of the proliferation and facilitation of neuronal differentiation, likely via its antioxidant activity.

Results showed that chronic administration of melatonin decreased cell loss in the cerebral cortex and reduced oxidative damage in protein and lipids. There are several studies suggesting that the activation of the cdk5/p35 pathway at its cleavage to cdk5/p25 may play a role in hyperphosphorylation of tau during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Melatonin not only reduced the cerebral aging disturbances, but also prevented tau hyperphosphorylation present in the experimental model used in this study. Melatonin reduced cdk5 expression, as well as the cleavage of p35 to p25. The other tau kinase studied, GSK3beta, showed a reduction in this activity in comparison with SAMP8 nontreated SAMP8.

In experimental animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, rotenone, a commercially available organic pesticide, induces symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We found that that rotenone is toxic to the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (4-day LC50 0.8 microM). Rotenone, at concentrations from 0.1 to 5 microM, caused progressive and irreversible behavioural deficits in both acute and chronic exposure. Chronic exposure to 0.5 microM rotenone led to a progressive decrease in spontaneous locomotion and in feeding, reaching almost 100% inhibition of both behaviours by the 7th day of rotenone treatment. In the central nervous system preparation made on the 7th day of treatment the postsynaptic potentials evoked by the identified dopaminergic RPeD1 neuron disappeared whereas the synaptic inputs received by the RPeD1 from a peptidergic neuron (VD4) were still functional. Immunostaining revealed that the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity decreased below the detectable level in both the RPeD1 cell body and its axonal processes. Finally, HPLC assay showed a significant (25%) decrease in DA level in the CNS by the 7th day of rotenone treatment. We conclude that, as in vertebrates, rotenone disrupts feeding and locomotion of the model mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis. One possible target of rotenone is the dopaminergic neurons in the CNS. We therefore suggest that Lymnaea stagnalis is a suitable invertebrate model for the study of Parkinson's disease, allowing direct analysis of the response of dopaminergic systems to rotenone at behavioural, cellular and neuronal levels.</AbstractText>"}

Spontaneous basal apoptosis, after 24 h incubation in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% serum, was 5%. Dotarizine (30--50 microM) enhanced basal apoptosis to 18--43%, flunarizine (30--50 microM) to 15%, thapsigargin (1--10 microM) to 21--35%, and cyclopiazonic acid (100 microM) to 10%. Serum deprivation augmented basal apoptosis to 20%. Under serum-free medium, 30 microM dotarizine or flunarizine drastically enhanced apoptosis to 63% and 68%, respectively; the increase was milder with 1 microM thapsigargin (37%) and 30 microM cyclopiazonic acid (27%). In serum-free medium, albumin (29 or 49 mg/ml) fully prevented the apoptotic effects of dotarizine, flunarizine and cyclopiazonic acid. The four compounds increased the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) in fluo-4 loaded cells; such increase developed slowly to reach a plateau after several minutes, followed by a slow decline. Albumin did not modify the kinetic parameters of such increase. In the absence of serum, dotarizine, flunarizine, thapsigargin, and cyclopiazonic acid caused mitochondrial depolarization in tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE)-loaded cells; depolarization was inhibited by cytoprotective concentrations of albumin. These results suggest that albumin protects cells from entering into apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial depolarization.

Together with the underlying motor symptoms, sleep disorders are the main causes of disability and have a substantial impact on the quality of life of these patients. Of particular interest are the behavior disorders of REM sleep (RBD) which are reported in many cases to precede the development of Parkinson's disease. In cases of diagnosing a REM sleep behavior disorder, it is absolutely necessary to exclude any underlying neurodegenerative process. Unlike the diagnosis of idiopathic RBD which can easily be made by conducting only a structured clinical interview, more than half of the RBD cases in patients with Parkinson's disease would be omitted using this technique. Patients with Parkinson's disease should be examined by polysomnography as the clinical interview's sensitivity alone can hardly reach 33%. This is so because there are mild forms of RBD in Parkinson's disease while the idiopathic forms always present with markedly severe clinical manifestations. Pathogenetically, Parkinson's disease share many similar features with RBD. Both conditions are characterized by a reduced striatal dopaminergic mediation. And yet there is no definitive answer to the question why RBD does not develop in all patients with Parkinson's disease. Clonazepam is highly effective in the treatment of RBD. Early diagnosis is thus critical for the prevention of injuries to the patient or to the patient's bed partner.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we characterized aggresomes formed by the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin 1 (PS1) protein. Proteasome inhibition induced accumulation of PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and retrotranslocation of the protein from the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Aggresomes formed by PS1 modified the ER structure whereas proteasomes were inhibited. Therefore, clear visual identification of PS1 aggresomes required removal of the proteasome inhibitor followed by hours of recovery to redistribute the ER throughout the cells. Aggresomes formed by PS1 did not potentiate or attenuate apoptotic cell death induced by staurosporine treatment. Selective presence of the heat-shock proteins Hsp70 and HDJ-2/HSDJ, but not Hsp90, in aggresomes suggested chaperone-mediated transport of PS1 into these structures. Because proteasome inhibition and heat shock are both known to induce expression of heat shock proteins, we also demonstrated that heat shock alone was sufficient to induce PS1 aggresome formation and Hsp70 expression. These results indicate that aggresome formation by PS1 is chaperone-mediated and can be induced in response to heat-shock stress, a common cellular event in neurodegenerative diseases. Malfunctioning of the proteasome or heat-shock stress response in the brains of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease may lead to the accumulation of stable aggresomes of PS1, perhaps contributing to neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

We found that these protective effects were characterized by increasing the expression level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the neuronal cells and this expression level was dependent on the concentration of transduced WT Tat-alpha-synuclein. These results suggest that transduced Tat-alpha-synuclein might protect cell death from oxidative stress by increasing the expression level of HSP70 in vitro and in vivo and this may be of potential therapeutic benefit in the pathogenesis of PD.</AbstractText>"}

In recent decades evidence has accumulated demonstrating the birth and functional integration of new neurons in specific regions of the adult mammalian brain, including the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. 2. Studies in a variety of models have revealed genetic, environmental and pharmacological factors that regulate adult neurogenesis. The present review examines some of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that could be mediating these regulatory effects in both the normal and dysfunctional brain. 3. The dysregulation of adult neurogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as psychiatric disorders such as depression. Recent evidence supports this idea and, furthermore, also indicates that factors promoting neurogenesis can modify the onset and progression of specific brain disorders, including Huntington's disease and depression.</AbstractText>"}

The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain that overlies the caudate nucleus is one of the principal brain regions in which neurogenesis occurs in the human brain, throughout life. 2. In response to the degeneration that occurs in the caudate nucleus in Huntington's disease, or in the caudate nucleus or cortex in stroke models, the SVZ increases the production of progenitor cells that migrate towards the site of the damage where they can differentiate into mature neurons and glial cells. The SVZ contains three main cell types and these are progenitor cells, glial cells and migratory neuroblasts; glial cells are the most common cell type and, in response to Huntington's disease, most of the SVZ cell proliferation is glial, but the number of precursor and neuroblasts is also increased. 3. The SVZ is enriched in neuroactive compounds, such as neuropeptide Y and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits gamma2, which stimulate ongoing neurogenesis. Interestingly, these stimulating cues are upregulated in the SVZ in response to Huntington's disease. Thus, the SVZ comprises heterogeneous cell types that are maintained in an environment that is permissive to neurogenesis and gliogenesis, and responds to neurodegenerative changes in adjacent brain regions by increasing progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in an attempt to replace the cells that die as a result of neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

CSF represents a repertoire of neuro-secreted, biosynthesised and metabolised molecular products of the central nervous system (CNS). Diffusion of macromolecules from the peripheral circulatory system to the CSF is highly regulated by the blood-brain barrier, which prevents uncontrolled distribution of proteins in the CNS. The development of reproducible high resolution separations of proteins in 2-D electrophoresis methods by the advent of immobilised pH gradient has opened the route to multivariate holistic protein pattern investigation of CSF into neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, the introduction of pre-fractionation techniques such as free flow electrophoresis is currently increasing the dynamic depth of proteome analysis. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, demyelinating diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been evaluated for biomarker discovery by CSF investigation in multiple studies. However, the statistical design of these clinical cross-sectional investigations remains a limited factor given the strong statistical power required for complex multivariate analysis. These initial evidences are of particular interest in dissecting specific molecular mechanisms. The development of fast and economic profiling of CSF by linear matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is providing a new ancillary technology to assess sample quality and pre-analytical requirements. In the following we take into account all these issues in the CSF proteomics investigation, especially highlighting the possible application in the development of clinical molecular biomarkers.</AbstractText>"}

In order to facilitate studies of pathogenesis and therapeutics, we have generated a new inducible mouse model of HD expressing full-length huntingtin (Htt) using a tetracycline-regulated promoter. In double transgenic mice Htt was expressed widely in the brain under the control of the tet-transactivator (tTA) driven by the prion promoter PrP (in the absence of doxycycline). Mice expressing full-length mutant Htt, but not full-length normal Htt, displayed a progressive behavioral phenotype, consisting of slowed and irregular voluntary movements, gait ataxia, tremor and jerky movements, incoordination, and weight loss, with a shortened lifespan. Neuropathology included prominent intranuclear inclusions in cortex and striatum as well as cytoplasmic aggregates. This phenotype is very similar to the phenotypes of previous transgenic mice expressing N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt. The current HD-transgenic mice had nuclear accumulation of Htt, particularly an approximately 60-kDa fragment, which appears to represent an N-terminal cleavage product. This fragment is smaller than calpain or caspase-derived cleavage products of Htt, but it is comparable to a product, termed cp-A, which accumulates in nuclei of cells in a previously described cell model. This new mouse model may be useful in the future for pathogenic and preclinical therapeutic studies related to HD. The data suggest that proteolytic processing could be a part of the pathogenesis of HD, potentially representing an attractive therapeutic target.</AbstractText>"}

These include whether fibril-forming proteins have two structurally distinct stable states, native and fibrillar, and whether all or only part of the native protein refolds as it converts to the fibrillar state. Here we show that a designed amyloid-like fibril of the well-characterized enzyme RNase A contains native-like molecules capable of enzymatic activity.

However, questions have arisen as to whether such fibrils or smaller subfibrillar oligomers are the prime causes of disease. Abnormal deposits in TSEs are rich in PrP(res), a protease-resistant form of the PrP protein with the ability to convert the normal, protease-sensitive form of the protein (PrP(sen)) into PrP(res) (ref. 3). TSEs can be transmitted between organisms by an enigmatic agent (prion) that contains PrP(res) (refs 4 and 5). To evaluate systematically the relationship between infectivity, converting activity and the size of various PrP(res)-containing aggregates, PrP(res) was partially disaggregated, fractionated by size and analysed by light scattering and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Our analyses revealed that with respect to PrP content, infectivity and converting activity peaked markedly in 17-27-nm (300-600 kDa) particles, whereas these activities were substantially lower in large fibrils and virtually absent in oligomers of &lt; or =5 PrP molecules. These results suggest that non-fibrillar particles, with masses equivalent to 14-28 PrP molecules, are the most efficient initiators of TSE disease.</AbstractText>"}

Here we demonstrate that a restricted number of cells with differentiated astroglial features can be obtained from human adult MSCs (hMSCs) both in vitro using different induction protocols and in vivo after transplantation into the developing mouse brain. We then examined the in vitro differentiation capacity of the hMSCs in coculture with slices of neonatal brain cortex. In this condition the hMSCs did not show any neuronal transdifferentiation but expressed neurotrophin low-affinity (NGFR(p75)) and high-affinity (trkC) receptors and released nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The same neurotrophin's expression was demonstrated 45 days after the intracerebral transplantation of hMSCs into nude mice with surviving astroglial cells. These data further confirm the limited capability of adult hMSC to differentiate into neurons whereas they differentiated in astroglial cells. Moreover, the secretion of neurotrophic factors combined with activation of the specific receptors of transplanted hMSCs demonstrated an alternative mechanism for neuroprotection of degenerating neurons. hMSCs are further defined in their transplantation potential for treating neurological disorders.</AbstractText>"}

We looked for PGRN mutations in a large series of 210 FTD patients (52 familial, 158 sporadic) to accurately evaluate the frequency of PGRN mutations in both sporadic and familial FTD, and FTD with associated motoneuron disease (FTD-MND), as well as to study the clinical phenotype of patients with a PGRN mutation. We identified nine novel PGRN null mutations in 10 index patients. The relative frequency of PGRN null mutations in FTD was 4.8% (10/210) and 12.8% (5/39) in pure familial forms. Interestingly, 5/158 (3.2%) apparently sporadic FTD patients carried a PGRN mutation, suggesting the possibility of de novo mutations or incomplete penetrance. In contrast, none of the 43 patients with FTD-MND had PGRN mutations, supporting that FTDU-17 and FTD-MND are genetically distinct. The clinical phenotype of PGRN mutation carriers was particular because of the wide range in onset age and the frequent occurrence of early apraxia (50%), visual hallucinations (30%), and parkinsonism (30%) during the course of the disease. This study supports that PGRN null mutations represent a more frequent cause of FTD than MAPT mutations (4.8% vs. 2.9%) but are not responsible for FTD-MND. It also demonstrates that half of the patients with a PGRN mutation in our series had no apparent family history of dementia.

Since defects in these processes may result in the expression of inherited and or acquired disease, the identification of candidate disease genes and modifier genes by parallel use of genotyping together with an integrated study of gene expression and metabolite levels is instrumental for future health care. This approach, called systems biology, aims to recognize early onset of disease, institute preventive treatment, and identify new molecular targets for novel drugs in cancer, cardiovascular and metabolomic disease (e.g., diabetes), and neurodegenerative disorders. Gene interaction networks have recently been demonstrated, in which hub genes, that is, genes that show the highest level of interactions with other genes, play a special role. Hub genes, often chromatin regulators, may act as modifier genes (genes that modify the effect of other genes) in multiple mechanistically unrelated genetic diseases in humans. In addition, it has been shown that small metabolites such as hormones and cytokines, or proteins/enzymes such as C reactive protein (C-RP) and matrix metaloproteinase (MMP), reflect disease status in case of oral cancer, asthma, or periodontal and cardiac disease. Many of these molecular targets, as well as pathogen-specific DNA and RNA sequences, can be measured in oral fluids, providing a unique opportunity to develop novel noninvasive diagnostic tests. Efforts so far concentrate on the use of lab-on-a-chip technology in combination with novel reporters and microsensor arrays to measure multianalytes in oral fluids. Handheld devices that perform sensitive detection of multiple analytes in oral fluid will be obtainable in the near future.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we investigated whether peripheral immunomodulatory treatment for MS/EAE, glatiramer acetate (GA), can enhance neurogenesis and generate neuroprotection in the CNS of EAE-inflicted mice. EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide, either in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) 2.2 transgenic mice, which selectively express YFP on their neuronal population, or in C57BL/6 mice. The in situ effect of GA was studied in various brain regions; neuroprotection and neurogeneration were evaluated and quantified by measuring the expression of different neuronal antigens and in vivo proliferation markers. The results demonstrated that in EAE-inflicted mice, neuroproliferation was initially elevated after disease appearance but subsequently declined below that of naive mice. In contrast, GA treatment in various stages of the disease led to sustained reduction in the neuronal/axonal damage typical to the neurodegenerative disease course. Moreover, three processes characteristic of neurogenesis, namely cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, were augmented and extended by GA treatment in EAE mice compared with EAE-untreated mice and naive controls. The newborn neuroprogenitors manifested massive migration through exciting and dormant migration pathways, into injury sites in brain regions, which do not normally undergo neurogenesis, and differentiated to mature neuronal phenotype. This suggests a direct linkage between immunomodulation, neurogenesis, and an in situ therapeutic consequence in the CNS.</AbstractText>"}

Cdh1-APC is active in postmitotic neurons, where it regulates axonal growth and patterning in the developing brain. However, it remains unknown whether Cdh1-APC is involved in preventing cell-cycle progression in terminally differentiated neurons. To address this issue, we used the small hairpin RNA strategy to deplete Cdh1 in postmitotic neurons. We observed that Cdh1 silencing rapidly triggered apoptotic neuronal death. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we focused on cyclin B1, a major Cdh1-APC substrate. Our results demonstrate that Cdh1 is required to prevent the accumulation of cyclin B1 in terminally differentiated neurons. Moreover, by keeping cyclin B1 low, Cdh1 prevented these neurons from entering an aberrant S phase that led to apoptotic cell death. These results provide an explanation for the mechanism of cyclin B1 reactivation that occurs in the brain of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Propargylamine (0.1-10 microM) dose-dependently reduced the levels of the early apoptosis-associated phosphorylated protein, H2A-X (ser 139), as well as decreased the cleavage of caspase-3 and its substrate poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP).

Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that propargylamine elevated gene expression levels of Bcl-2, and the neurotrophic factors glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced Bax gene expression. Serum deprivation increased mRNA and protein levels of holo-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which was markedly decreased by propargylamine. This was accompanied by inducing the release of the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase form of soluble APP (sAPPalpha) into the medium.

The distribution and physiological roles of tTG have been widely studied in numerous cell types and tissues, but only recently its role in human diseases has started to be clarified. For example, transglutaminase activity has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for several human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as polyglutamine diseases hitherto identified. Among human diseases, a large and recent series of studies have clearly shown that the activity of the tTG is critical for a very diffuse human pathology known as Celiac Disease. This disease is due to intolerance to a food component, gliadin, and is characterized by a very complex clinical syndrome, including gastrointestinal pathological manifestations, often associated with extra-intestinal manifestations. Interestingly, a subset of celiac patients also develops certain neurological disorders. In this review we describe the roles played by tTG in the molecular mechanisms responsible for pathophysiology of Celiac Disease.</AbstractText>"}

He was usually depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions. Janus was frequently used to symbolize change and transitions, such as the progression from past to future or from one viewpoint to another. 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and other nitrophenols have long been known to be toxic at high concentrations (the 'bad' face of DNP), an effect that appears essentially related to interference with cellular energy metabolism due to uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Five years ago, however, we published the first report showing that low concentrations of DNP protect neurons against the toxicity of the amyloid-beta peptide (De Felice et al. (2001) FASEB J. 15:1297 - 1299]. Since then, other studies have provided evidence of beneficial actions of DNP (at low concentrations), including neuroprotection against different types of insult, blockade of amyloid aggregation, stimulation of neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation, and even extension of lifespan in certain organisms. Some of these effects appear to be due to mild mitochondrial uncoupling and prevention of cellular oxidative stress, whereas other actions are related to activation of additional intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, a novel and 'gentle' face of DNP is emerging from such studies. In this review, we discuss both toxic and beneficial actions of DNP. The evidence available so far suggests that DNP and other compounds with similar biological activities may be of significant interest to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders.</AbstractText>"}

The neurotrophic activity of the target compounds was assessed in chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures. As a result, 6 out of 11 test compounds at either or both concentrations of 1 pM and 100 pM significantly promoted neurite outgrowth in DRGs in the presence of 0.15 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). Compound 5c at 100 pM exhibited the greatest neurotrophic effect in promoting both the number and length of neurite processes.

Filamentous inclusions, in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis, composed mainly of alpha synuclein, been the hallmark of diffuse Lewy body dementia, have been described in the neurons of the substantia nigra in many cases of Parkinson's disease associated with dementia. In previous studies we have described the morphological alterations in the synapses in the caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus in cases of Parkinson's disease. In the present study we attempted to describe the morphological and morphometric alterations of the locus coeruleus in patients who suffered from Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function and in patients who suffered from Parkinson's disease associated with dementia, comparing them with normal controls. The morphological alterations of the neurons, the dendrites, the retrograde axonic collaterals and the synapses were more impressive in cases of Parkinson's disease associated with dementia than in Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function. The majority of the synapses demonstrated changes in size and shape of the pre- and postsynaptic components, polymorphism of the synaptic vesicles and marked morphological alterations of the mitochondria. The morphological alterations of the synapses in cases of Parkinson's disease associated with dementia, plead in favor of the importance of the neuronal circuits of locus coeruleus in cognitive functions.</AbstractText>"}

Activation of Group II or III mGluR on astrocytes with selective agonists DCG-IV or L-AP4 respectively inhibited astroglial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-conditioned medium induced apoptosis of primary cultured mesencephalic neurons. Specific Group II or III mGluR antagonists APICA or MSOP completely abolished the neuroprotective effects of DCG-IV and L-AP4. Morphologic analysis showed that DCG-IV or L-AP4 could also attenuate the astroglial neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons. Measurement of extracellular glutamate concentration and [(3)H]-glutamate uptake showed that the restoration of glutamate uptake capability in LPS-treated astrocytes might be involved in the neuroprotective effects of activating astroglial Group II or III mGluR. Furthermore, we found that the repression of astroglial uptake function could be revived by GSH, and both Group II and III mGluR agonists could recover the endogenous reduced glutathione (GSH) level in LPS-treated astrocytes. These results suggested that the possible mechanisms of neuroprotection by either Type II or Type III mGluR activation may involve restoration of endogenous GSH, in turn affording recovery of astroglial capability to take up glutamate.</AbstractText>"}

In the YAC128 mouse model, testicular degeneration develops prior to 12 months of age, but at 12 months, there is no evidence for decreased testosterone levels or loss of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus.

Experimental data in animal models of stroke have provided exhaustive evidence of the neuroprotective properties of this steroid hormone. Our laboratory in particular has demonstrated that acute estrogen treatment in male rats significantly reduced (approximately 50%) ischemic cell death within 4 h following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in the protective actions of estrogen in this experimental model have yet to be elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that in various in vivo and in vitro models, estrogen can be pro-apoptotic and that this effect may be mediated by an estrogen-induced up-regulation of the Fas/FasL system and the subsequent activation of caspase-12. We therefore hypothesized that under ischemic conditions following MCAO, estrogen would up-regulate protective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways leading to caspase-12 activation, thus limiting infarct volume. Our results showed that estrogen significantly increased activated caspase-12 at 2, 3 and 4 h post-MCAO. Immunostaining of brain sections showed a significantly higher number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling positive cells in estrogen-treated animals at 4 h, but not at 2 h, post-MCAO. These findings correlate with previous observations that differences in infarct volume between saline and estrogen-treated animals are not seen until 3 and 4 h post-MCAO. A decrease in m-calpain expression was observed in the infarct region only at 4 h post-MCAO following estrogen pre-treatment, suggesting m-calpain may not be involved in regulating estrogen-induced caspase-12 activation. Based on these cellular changes correlated to estrogen pretreatment, we conclude that estrogen may up-regulate ER-specific apoptotic pathways, thus limiting the extent of necrotic cell death which is responsible for the spreading depression and growth of the infarct volume following MCAO.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, the role of the neuron-glia interaction and the inflammatory process, in particular, has been the object of intense study by the research community. It seems to represent a new therapeutic approach opportunity for this neurological disorder. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) is up-regulated in SNc DAergic neurons in both PD patients and animal models of PD and, furthermore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) pre-treatment protects against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6 hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced nigro-striatal dopamine degeneration.

Although patients affected by this disorder predominantly present central and peripheral demyelination as well as adrenal insufficiency, the mechanisms underlying the brain damage in X-ALD are poorly known. The current treatment of X-ALD with glyceroltrioleate (C(18:1))/glyceroltrierucate (C(22:1)) (Lorenzo's oil, LO) combined with a VLCFA-poor diet normalizes VLCFA concentrations, but the neurological symptoms persist or even progress in symptomatic patients. Considering that free radical generation is involved in various neurodegenerative disorders and that in a previous study we showed evidence that oxidative stress is probably involved in the pathophysiology of X-ALD symptomatic patients, in the present study we evaluated various oxidative stress parameters, namely thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBA-RS) and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) in plasma, as well as the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes from symptomatic and asymptomatic X-ALD patients and verified whether LO treatment and a VLCFA restricted diet could change these parameters. We observed a significant increase of plasma TBA-RS in symptomatic and asymptomatic X-ALD patients, reflecting induction of lipid peroxidation even before the disease was manifested. In addition, LO treatment did not alter this profile. Furthermore, plasma TAR measurement of X-ALD patients was not different from that of controls. Similarly, the antioxidant enzyme activities CAT, SOD and GPx were not altered in erythrocyte from X-ALD patients as compared to controls. We also examined the in vitro effects of hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) and tetracosanoic acid (C(24:0)) alone or combined with oleic (C(18:1))/erucic (C(22:1)) acids on various oxidative stress parameters in cerebral cortex of young rats, namely chemiluminescence, TBA-RS, TAR, CAT, SOD and GPx in order to investigate whether those fatty acids were able to induce oxidative stress. We found that there was a significant increase of TBARS and of chemiluminescence in rat cerebral cortex exposed to C(26:0)/C(24:0), and that the addition of C(18:1)and C(22:1) to the assays did not prevent this effect. Furthermore, TAR measurement was not altered by C(26:0) and C(24:0) acids in rat cerebral cortex.

Heterocyclic compounds such as acridine derivatives like quinacrine abolish prion infectivity in a cell culture model of prion disease. Here, we report that these compounds execute their antiprion activity by redistributing cholesterol from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments, thereby destabilizing membrane domains. Our findings are supported by the fact that structurally unrelated compounds with known cholesterol-redistributing effects - U18666A, amiodarone, and progesterone - also possessed high antiprion potency. We show that tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine), another class of heterocyclic compounds, displayed structure-dependent antiprion effects and enhanced the antiprion effects of quinacrine, allowing lower doses of both drugs to be used in combination. Treatment of ScN2a cells with quinacrine or desipramine induced different ultrastructural and morphological changes in endosomal compartments. We synthesized a novel drug from quinacrine and desipramine, termed quinpramine, that led to a fivefold increase in antiprion activity compared to quinacrine with an EC50 of 85 nm. Furthermore, simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, acted synergistically with both heterocyclic compounds to clear PrPSc. Our data suggest that a cocktail of drugs targeting the lipid metabolism that controls PrP conversion may be the most efficient in treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</AbstractText>"}

Tissue distribution analysis reveals a predominantly neuronal expression during the late stages of neurogenesis and, in the adult brain, in areas where synaptic changes are associated with learning and memory (synaptic plasticity). In vitro studies revealed complex formation between neuroserpin and different serine proteases, i.e. tPA, uPA, and plasmin. The neuroserpin-target complex has so far not been characterized in vivo. However, some investigations help to understand the functional role of this serpin. Neuroserpin was shown to be involved in the regulation of the morphology of neuroendocrine cells in culture, possibly by modulating the degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes such as tPA. Moreover, a role of neuroserpin in mood regulation has been deduced from the over- and underexpression of neuroserpin in genetically modified mice, which showed increased anxiety and novelty-induced hypo-locomotion. In pathological conditions of the central nervous system (i.e. stroke and seizures), neuroserpin plays a neuroprotective role, probably by blocking the deleterious effects of tPA. A familial form of a neurodegenerative disease, termed familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies, is caused by point mutations in the neuroserpin gene. This condition is characterized by the intracellular polymerization and accumulation of mutated neuroserpin, leading to neuronal death and dementia.</AbstractText>"}

The C-terminal peptide of mechano-growth factor (MGF), an alternatively spliced variant of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), was found to function independently from the rest of the molecule and showed a neuroprotective effect in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, in a gerbil model of transient brain ischemia, treatment with the synthetic MGF C-terminal peptide provided very significant protection to the vulnerable neurons. In the same model, ischemia evoked increased expression of endogenous MGF in the ischemia-resistant hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the endogenous MGF might have an important neuroprotective function. In an in vitro organotypic hippocampal culture model of neurodegeneration, the synthetic peptide was as potent as the full-length IGF-1 while its effect lasted significantly longer than that of recombinant IGF-1. While two peptides showed an additive effect, the neuroprotective action of the C-terminal MGF was independent from the IGF-1 receptor, indicating a new mode of action for this molecule. Although MGF is known for its regenerative capability in skeletal muscle, our findings demonstrate for the first time a neuroprotective role against ischemia for this specific IGF-1 isoform.

Alpha-crystallin, a lens structural protein, comprising alpha-A and alpha-B subunits is an ubiquitous molecular chaperone, which have been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhance cellular glutathione level in the acute inflammation-induced mice. Results show that the proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) were significantly high (P&lt;0.05) in the plasma, liver, cortex and hippocampus of inflammation-induced mice when compared to control.

Clusters provide the critical mass required both to underpin innovation potential and to authenticate regional claims to international competitiveness. Medicen is a biomedicine and therapeutics cluster comprising 120 partners from four broad 'colleges' in the greater Paris region: major industry, small and medium-sized businesses, teaching hospitals/State research bodies, and local councils. Chief among its cooperative R&amp;D projects is the neuroscience subcluster, in which 'TransAl' the neurodegenerative disease project, counts Sanofi-Aventis, Servier and the French Atomic Energy Commission [Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA)] as key partners. One main aim is to develop an experimental model in rhesus monkeys in which a putative cause of Alzheimer's disease, intracerebral accumulation of b-amyloid peptide, is generated by impairing the peptide's clearance. The other aim, in which the nuclear medicine expertise of the CEA will be crucial, is to identify, characterize and validate markers for magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography imaging, and to source biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid proteomics. A human biological resource centre (DNA and tissue banks) project dedicated to neurological and psychiatric disease should be up and running in 2007.

The primary objective of our study was to evaluate whether modifications in MR metabolite levels occur before clinical disease onset, and whether these changes are directly linked to a distinct spatial progression pattern in the CNS. Therefore, age-dependent alterations in the cerebral and spinal metabolic profile in the mouse model of ALS overexpressing the mutated human G93A-superoxide dismutase 1 (G93A-SOD1) were determined by high-resolution MRS of tissue extracts at 14.1 Tesla. Both non-transgenic mice (control mice) and transgenic mice overexpressing the non-mutated human SOD1 (tg-SOD1) served as controls. In the spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 mice significantly decreased levels of N-acetyl aspartate were already detected 34 days postpartum, i.e. about 60 days before the average disease onset caused by motor neuron decline. In addition, glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations were significantly diminished at Day 75, which is still in the presymptomatic phase of the disease. These metabolic changes were further progressive in the course of the disease and started to involve the brainstem at Day 75. Overall, high-resolution (1)H-MRS allows a sensitive spatial and temporal metabolite profiling in the presymptomatic phase of ALS even before significant neuronal cell loss occurs.</AbstractText>"}

Mice modeling tauopathies have been generated by overexpression of human tau with FTDP-17 mutations, in order to gain more profound insights into molecular links between tau abnormalities and neurodegeneration. A subset of these mice were reported to exhibit abundant tau amyloid lesions resembling neurofibrillary changes in human tauopathies, and pronounced neuronal loss notable as progressive brain atrophy. Significantly, formation of mature amyloid fibrils is not tightly associated with neuron death, while deposition of microtubule-unbound phosphorylated tau, which conceivably emerges early in tau fibrillogenesis, appears to critically contribute to disruption of neuronal integrity. In addition to such mechanistic elucidation, mouse models of tauopathies are currently being applied to exploitation of imaging agents for visualization of tau pathologies in living brains.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the ubiquitylation and aggregate formation of polyglutamine-containing proteins has been largely unclear. Here we report the identification of critical factors involved in the ubiquitylation process as well as turnover of MJD1/Ataxin-3 protein, in which the abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract is responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease). E4 B/UFD2a (a ubiquitin chain assembly factor) and VCP (a AAA-family ATPase) were co-purified with the activity polyubiquitylating Ataxin-3. E4B mediated polyubiquitylation of MJD1/Ataxin-3, and VCP interacted with both E 4B and MJD1 Ataxin-3. In a Drosophila model of SCA3, expression of E4B suppressed the neurodegeneration induced by an Ataxin-3 mutant. These observations suggest that E4 is a rate-limiting factor in the degradation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine tracts.</AbstractText>"}

The experimental inclusion body called aggresome is formed at microtubule organizing center by the help of microtubules and motor protein complex upon proteasome inhibition. Recently, the author reported that the collection of aggregated proteins to aggresome is closely related to their degradation by autophagy-lysosomal degradation system which strongly suggested that autophagy is a back-up system for ubiquitin proteasomal protein degradation system.

In many organisms, the primary role of autophagy is adaptation to starvation. However, we have found that autophagy is also important for intracellular quality control, particularly in quiescent cells such as neurons. Atg5 -/- mice die shortly after birth due, at least in part, to nutrient deficiency. These mice also exhibit an intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates in neurons and hepatocytes. Neural cell-specific Atg5-deficient mice, Atg5(flox/flox); Nestin-Cre mice, show progressive deficits in motor function and degeneration of some neural cells. In autophagy-deficient cells, diffuse accumulation of abnormal proteins occurs, followed by generation of aggregates and inclusions. This study emphasizes that basal autophagy is important even in individuals who do not express neurodegenerative disease-associated mutant proteins. Further, the primary targets of autophagy are diffused cytosolic proteins, not protein aggregates themselves. These data suggest that basal autophagy has a critical role in intracellular protein quality control under normal conditions, which is independent of the role of induced autophagy as an adaptation to starvation.</AbstractText>"}

Key mediators of excitotoxic damage include overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, resulting in excessive Ca(2+) influx with production of free radicals and other injurious pathways. Overproduction of free radical nitric oxide (NO) contributes to acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. NO can react with cysteine thiol groups to form S-nitrosothiols and thus change protein function. S-nitrosylation can result in neuroprotective or neurodestructive consequences depending on the protein involved. Many neurodegenerative diseases manifest conformational changes in proteins that result in misfolding and aggregation. Our recent studies have linked nitrosative stress to protein misfolding and neuronal cell death. Molecular chaperones - such as protein-disulfide isomerase, glucose-regulated protein 78, and heat-shock proteins - can provide neuroprotection by facilitating proper protein folding. Here, we review the effect of S-nitrosylation on protein function under excitotoxic conditions, and present evidence that NO contributes to degenerative conditions by S-nitrosylating-specific chaperones that would otherwise prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuronal cell death. In contrast, we also review therapeutics that can abrogate excitotoxic damage by preventing excessive NMDA receptor activity, in part via S-nitrosylation of this receptor to curtail excessive activity.</AbstractText>"}

A first step in such treatment development is to determine the role of various components of the defense system in cells that degenerate. In this study, we sought to determine the role of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in two models of oxidative damage-induced retinal degeneration. In one model, paraquat is injected into the vitreous cavity and then enters retinal cells and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause progressive retinal damage. Assessment of retinal function with serial electroretinograms (ERGs) showed that sod1 -/- mice were much more sensitive than sod1 +/+ mice to the damaging effects of paraquat, while sod1 +/- mice showed intermediate sensitivity. Compared to sod1 +/+ mice, sod1 -/- mice showed greater paraquat-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis. In the second model, mice were exposed to hyperoxia for several weeks, and sod1 -/- mice showed significantly greater reductions in ERG amplitudes than sod1 +/+ mice. In both of these models, transgenic mice carrying a sod1 transgene driven by a beta-actin promoter showed less oxidative stress-induced reduction in ERG amplitudes. These data demonstrate that SOD1 protects retinal cells against paraquat- and hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage and suggest that overexpression of SOD1 should be considered as one component of ocular gene therapy to prevent oxidative damage-induced retinal degeneration.</AbstractText>"}

A therapeutic approach that could selectively eliminate would be a promising remedy for neurodegenerative disorders. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), one of the polyQ diseases, is a late-onset motor neuron disease characterized by proximal muscle atrophy, weakness, contraction fasciculations, and bulbar involvement. The pathogenic gene product is polyQ-expanded androgen receptor (AR), which belongs to the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 client protein family. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a novel Hsp90 inhibitor, is a new derivative of geldanamycin that shares its important biological activities but shows less toxicity. 17-AAG is now in phase II clinical trials as a potential anti-cancer agent because of its ability to selectively degrade several oncoproteins. We have recently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of 17-AAG in a mouse model of SBMA. The administration of 17-AAG significantly ameliorated polyQ-mediated motor neuron degeneration by reducing the total amount of mutant AR. 17-AAG accomplished the preferential reduction of mutant AR mainly through Hsp90 chaperone complex formation and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. 17-AAG induced Hsp70 and Hsp40 in vivo as previously reported; however, its ability to induce HSPs was limited, suggesting that the HSP induction might support the degradation of mutant protein. The ability of 17-AAG to preferentially degrade mutant protein would be directly applicable to SBMA and other neurodegenerative diseases in which the disease-causing proteins also belong to the Hsp90 client protein family. Our proposed therapeutic approach, modulation of Hsp90 function by 17-AAG treatment, has emerged as a candidate for molecular-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. This review will consider our research findings and discuss the possibility of a clinical application of 17-AAG to SBMA and other neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We investigate here for the first time in primate brain the combinatorial expression of the three major functionally relevant proteins for catecholaminergic neurotransmission tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic acid acid decarboxylase (AADC), and the brain-specific isoform of the vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2, using highly specific antibodies and immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy to visualize combinatorial expression of these proteins. 2. In addition to classical TH, AADC, and VMAT2-copositive catecholaminergic neurons, two unique kinds of TH-positive neurons were identified based on co-expression of AADC and VMAT2. 3. TH and AADC co-positive, but VMAT2-negative neurons, are termed 'nonexocytotic catecholaminergic TH neurons.' These were found in striatum, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius, and in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. 4. TH-positive neurons expressing neither AADC nor VMAT2 are termed 'dopaergic TH neurons.' We identified these neurons in supraoptic, paraventricular and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, thalamic paraventicular nucleus, habenula, parabrachial nucleus, cerebral cortex and spinal cord. We were unable to identify any dopaergic (TH-positive, AADC-negative) neurons that expressed VMAT2, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms exist for shutting off VMAT2 expression in neurons that fail to biosynthesize its substrates. 5. In several cases, the corresponding TH phenotypes were identified in the adult rat, suggesting that this rodent is an appropriate experimental model for further investigation of these TH-positive neuronal cell groups in the adult central nervous system. Thus, no examples of TH and VMAT2 co-positive neurons lacking AADC expression were found in rodent adult nervous system. 6. In conclusion, the adult mammalian nervous system contains in addition to classical catecholaminergic neurons, cells that can synthesize dopamine, but cannot transport and store it in synaptic vesicles, and neurons that can synthesize only L-dopa and lack VMAT2 expression. The presence of these additional populations of TH-positive neurons in the adult primate CNS has implications for functional catecholamine neurotransmission, its derangement in disease and drug abuse, and its rescue by gene therapeutic maneuvers in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

LTA (+/- MDP) from Staphylococcus aureus induced a strong inflammatory response of both types of glial cells (release of interleukin-1beta, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide). The death of CGCs was caused by activated glia because in the absence of glia (treatment with 7.5 microm cytosine-d-arabinoside to inhibit non-neuronal cell proliferation) LTA + MDP did not cause significant cell death (less than 20%). In addition, staining with rhodamine-labelled LTA confirmed that LTA was bound only to microglia and astrocytes (not neurones). Neuronal cell death induced by LTA (+/- MDP)-activated glia was partially blocked by an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (1400 W; 100 microm), and completely blocked by a superoxide dismutase mimetic [manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride; 50 microm] and a peroxynitrite scavenger [5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrinato iron (III); 100 microm] suggesting that nitric oxide and peroxynitrite contributed to LTA-induced cell death.

The etiology of the disease is unknown but recent epidemiological and experimental studies have renewed interest in the hypothesis that environmental factors, especially herbicides and metals, have a role on the pathogenesis of PD. For the first time, the association constants of alpha-synuclein with five herbicides have been calculated using a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method. In addition, the effect of a number of metals on this binding has been investigated. It appears that the herbicides preferentially bind to a partially folded intermediate conformation of alpha-synuclein induced by manganese, aluminium, cadmium, copper and zinc. Then, metal increases the synuclein-herbicide association. However, this study shows contrasting actions with the antibiotic rifampicin and magnesium addition leading to a decrease of the alpha-synuclein-herbicide interaction even if other metals are present in the bulk solvent. Considering epidemiological studies, all these results suggest an underlying molecular basis for PD and related body diseases.</AbstractText>"}

HSP pathology involves axonal degeneration that is most pronounced in the terminal segments of the longest descending (pyramidal) and ascending (dorsal columns) tracts. In this study, we compared spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 13 HSP patients with four different types of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG3A, SPG4, SPG6, and SPG8) with age-matched control subjects. The cross-section area of HSP subjects at cervical level C2 was 59.42 +/- 12.57 mm2 and at thoracic level T9 was 28.58 +/- 5.25 mm2. Both of these values were less than in the healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001). The degree of cord atrophy was more prominent in patients with SPG6 and SPG8 who had signs of severe cord atrophy (47.60 +/- 6.58 mm2 at C2, 21.40 +/- 2.4 mm2 at T9) than in subjects with SPG3 and SPG4 (66.0 +/- 8.94 mm2 at C2, p &lt; 0.02; 31.75 +/- 2.76 mm2 at T9, p &lt; 0.001). These observations indicate that spinal cord atrophy is a common finding in the four genetic types of HSP. Spinal cord atrophy was more severe in SPG6 and SPG8 HSP subjects than in other types of HSP we studied. This may suggest a different disease mechanism with more prominent axonal degeneration in these two types of HSP when compared with HSP due to spastin and atlastin mutations.</AbstractText>"}

An important question is whether these abnormalities actually contribute to the degenerative process or whether they are merely manifestations of cells that are already destined for degeneration. We have conducted a large screen in Drosophila for mutations that alter the growth or differentiation of cells during eye development. We have used mitotic recombination to generate patches of homozygous mutant cells. In our entire screen, mutations in only two different loci, burned (bnd) and scorched (scrd), resulted in eyes in which the mutant patches appeared black and the mutant tissue appeared to have undergone degeneration. In larval imaginal discs, growth and cell fate specification occur normally in mutant cells, but there is an accumulation of F-actin. Mutant cells degenerate much later during the pupal phase of development. burned mutations are allelic to mutations in the previously described cpb locus that encodes the beta-subunit of the F-actin capping protein, while scorched mutations disrupt the gene encoding its alpha-subunit (cpa). The alpha/beta-heterodimer caps the barbed ends of an actin filament and restricts its growth. In its absence, cells progressively accumulate actin filaments and eventually die. A possible role for their human orthologs in neurodegenerative disease merits further investigation.</AbstractText>"}

PPARgamma is a ligand activated transcription factor whose best described roles are to regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation. Agonists of PPARgamma have been shown to ameliorate AD-related pathology in animal models of AD and improve cognition. A number of potential mechanisms have been advanced to account for these effects. PPARgamma agonists act as insulin sensitizers, facilitating insulin action. In addition, PPARgamma agonists have been shown to inhibit inflammatory gene expression, alter Abeta homeostasis and exhibit neuroprotective effects.

Prospective population level evidence has emerged to show that both obesity and overweight, is associated with an increased risk of all cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and underlying neurodegenerative changes. Weight loss in late life however is associated with dementia, and those categorized as underweight are also at a greater risk of dementia. Given the current epidemic of obesity, and the expected age-related increase in dementia incidence, even a small association between these two diseases has far reaching public health implications. However, due to the effects of both AD-associated weight loss and age-related changes in body composition, there are methodological challenges in appropriately evaluating obesity as a risk factor for developing dementia. There is a need to take a 'life course approach' and to consider the role of risk factors prior to the onset of old age. Our work has shown that both obesity and overweight, as measured by body mass index and skinfold thickness, in middle-age are strongly associated with an increased risk of all cause dementia, Alzheimer disease &amp; Vascular dementia, independent of the development of diabetes and cardiovascular-related morbidities. There is also value in assessing regional body shape distributions of adiposity, particular the role of abdominal obesity. Mechanistic pathways such as adipocyte secreted proteins and hormones, and inflammatory cytokines could explain the association between obesity and increased risk of dementia.</AbstractText>"}

PARP-1, the best characterised member, works as a DNA damage nick-sensor protein that uses beta-NAD(+) to form polymers of ADP-ribose and has been implicated in DNA repair, maintenance of genomic integrity and mammalian longevity. The generation of free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and peroxynitrite causes overactivation of PARP resulting in the depletion of NAD(+) and ATP and consequently in necrotic cell death and organ dysfunction. PARP has also been involved in the up-regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory genes through the activation of several transcription nuclear factors. Thus, PARP plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as, stroke, myocardial infarction, circulatory shock, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, allergy, colitis and other inflammatory disorders. Pharmacological modulation of PARP activity may constitute a suitable target to enhance the cytotoxicity of certain DNA-damaging anticancer drugs. Also, PARP inhibition may be a viable strategy to control viral infections.

Here, the neuroprotective activity of ADNF-9 and NAP was tested in two human models of neuronal degeneration in culture mediated by oxidative stress: normal human cortical neurons treated with H2O2 and Down's syndrome (DS) cortical neurons. Incubation of normal cortical neurons with 50 microM H2O2 for 1 hour resulted in morphological and structural changes consistent with neuronal degeneration and loss of viability of more than 60% of the neurons present in the culture. Addition of ADNF-9 or NAP at femtomolar concentrations resulted in significant increases in survival of normal neurons treated with H2O2. Femtomolar concentrations of ADNF-9 or NAP exhibited a similar neuroprotective efficacy, comparable to the antioxidant N-tert-butyl-2-sulpho-phenylnitrone at 100 microM (s-PBN). Treatment of DS cortical neurons with ADNF-9 or NAP resulted in a significant increase in neuronal survival as well as reduction of degenerative morphological changes.

Although great strides have been made in the development of agents to treat this neurodegenerative disease, none yet address the underlying problem associated with it, the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Current therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease focus primarily on reducing the severity of its symptoms using dopaminergic medications. Although providing substantial benefit, these agents are burdened by adverse effects and long-term complications. This review highlights new and emerging therapies for Parkinson's disease, categorised as symptomatic, neuroprotective and neurorestorative, although at times, this distinction is not easily made. Novel symptomatic treatments target nondopaminergic areas in the hope of avoiding the motor complications seen with dopaminergic therapies. Two emerging treatment approaches under investigation are adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists (such as istradefylline [KW-6002]) and glutamate AMPA receptor antagonists (such as talampanel [LY-300164]). In 2003, the results from two studies using istradefylline in patients with Parkinson's disease were published, with both showing a positive benefit of the study drug when used as adjunctive therapy to levodopa. In non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease, talampanel has been found to have antiparkinsonian effects when administered as high-dose monotherapy and antidyskinetic effects on levodopa-induced dyskinesias. NS-2330, another drug currently undergoing clinical trials, is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor that has therapeutic potential in both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. A phase II proof-of-concept study is currently underway in early Parkinson's disease. However, a recently published study in advanced Parkinson's disease showed no therapeutic benefit of NS-2330 in this patient population. Even more exciting are agents that have a neuroprotective or neurorestorative role. These therapies aim to prevent disease progression by targeting the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Several lines of investigation for neuroprotective therapies have been taken, including the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (ubidecarenone) and anti-apoptotic agents such as CEP-1347. Studies in patients with Parkinson's disease with coenzyme Q10 have suggested that it slows down functional decline. The PRECEPT study is currently in progress to assess the neuroprotective role of CEP-1347 in the early phase of the disease. Gene therapy is another exciting arena and includes both potentially neuroprotective and neurorestorative agents. Novel methods include subthalamic glutamic acid decarboxylase gene therapy and the use of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Eleven of 12 patients have been enrolled in the first FDA-approved phase I subthalamic glutamic acid decarboxylase gene therapy trial for Parkinson's disease, with currently no evidence of adverse events. GDNF delivered intracerebroventricularly was studied in a small population of patients with Parkinson's disease, but unfortunately did not reveal positive results. Other methods of administering GDNF include direct delivery via infusions into the basal ganglia and the use of viral vectors; thus far, these approaches have shown promising results. This is an exciting and rewarding time for research into Parkinson's disease. With so many therapies currently under investigation, the time is ripe for the beginning of a new phase of treatment strategies.</AbstractText>"}

Analysis of mouse mutants provides one possible avenue towards identifying relevant mechanisms. Here, we used quantitative and serial section electron microscopy to find out whether the onset and time course of pre-synaptic nerve terminal degeneration is delayed in the striatum of Wallerian degeneration slow (Wld(s)) mutant mice. Synaptic degeneration was observed within 48 h of cortical ablation in wild-type mice but was delayed by approximately 1 week in Wld(s) mice. However, the morphological characteristics of degenerating nerve terminals in wild-type and Wld(s) mice were indistinguishable, in contrast to the differences reported previously in studies of the PNS. Surprisingly, the delayed onset of synaptic degeneration was accompanied by an increased incidence of complex synaptic morphologies on post-synaptic spines in the denervated Wld(S) striatum indicating an enhanced plastic response at both injured and uninjured synapses. The data suggest that targeting Wallerian-like mechanisms of synaptic degeneration could lead to the development of new therapies for the treatment of CNS disorders where synapse loss is a primary feature.</AbstractText>"}

Many factors are associated with such brain injury, including excitotoxicity and free radicals. Recent clinical studies have shown that high plasma ferritin levels are detrimental in acute ischemic stroke. As an iron-storage protein, ferritin can act both as a scavenger and as a donor of free iron, which is a source of hydroxyl radicals. Following disruption of the blood-brain barrier, the ferritin and the free iron that have accumulated in endothelial cells in brain capillaries, together with plasma ferritin, can enter the penumbra. Iron-dependent oxidative stress in the penumbra can lead to necrosis and further neurological deterioration following ischemic stroke. An excess of iron should be considered pathological in the ischemic brain. Therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke should attempt to restore brain function within the penumbra. Consequently, the iron content of systemic stores should be measured, and anti-oxidant treatment should be considered when it is excessive.</AbstractText>"}

It is charaterized by a progressive loss of dopamine (DA) producing neurons in the midbrain, which result in a decline of DA innervations present in the forebrain, in particular, the striatum. The disease leads to appearance of motor symptoms involving akinesia/bradykinesia, gait disturbances, postural imbalance and tremor. Oral administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the precursor of DA, provides very good symptomatic relief, but this intermittent and pharmacological treatment is compromised by severe side effects, such as the appearance of abnormal involuntary movements. Viral vector-mediated direct gene transfer techniques are currently being explored in order to provide continuous and stable synthesis of DA in the brain. This review focuses on the basic idea of DA replacement, first describing the enzymatic machinery important for DA synthesis and secondly the various alternative strategies pursued in several laboratories. The DOPA delivery strategy, based on the co-transduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) genes, has been shown to be a powerful approach providing a robust behavioral recovery and reversal of side effects of the pulsatile administration of L-DOPA medication. The DA delivery strategy, on the other hand, aims at triple transduction of the TH, GCH1 and aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzymes, and thereby provide a higher rate of conversion of DOPA to DA. Finally, transduction of AADC alone has been proposed as a means to improve the conversion of peripherally administered L-DOPA. As the basic scientific rationale behind these strategies are well understood and the results of the animal experiments are very encouraging, we are now entering into an exciting phase with increasing momentum toward the first clinical applications using this experimental therapy in patients suffering from PD.</AbstractText>"}

A hallmark of AD is the accumulation of plaques in the brain of AD patients. The plaques predominantly consist of aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta), a peptide of 39-42 amino acids generated in vivo by specific, proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. There is a growing body of evidence that Abeta aggregates are ordered oligomers and the cause rather than a product of AD. The analysis of the assembly pathway of Abeta in vitro and biochemical characterization of Abeta deposits isolated from AD brains indicate that Abeta oligomerization occurs via distinct intermediates, including oligomers of 3-50 Abeta monomers, annular oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils and plaques. Of these, the most toxic species appear to be small Abeta oligomers. This article reviews the current knowledge of the mechanism of Abeta assembly in vivo and in vitro, as well as the influence of inherited amino acid replacements in Abeta and experimental conditions on Abeta aggregation. Challenges regarding the reproducible handling of the Abeta peptide for in vitro assembly studies are discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2007 S.

Isoaspartates have been identified in a variety of cellular proteins in vivo as well as pathologically deposited proteins in neurodegenerative brain tissue. We described here that the formation of isoaspartate is enhanced in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific antibodies recognizing isoaspartate of Abeta revealed that isomerized Abeta peptides were deposited in senile plaques as well as amyloid-bearing vessels. Moreover, it was revealed that Abeta peptides, isomerized at position 7 or 23, were differentially deposited in senile plaques and vascular amyloids in AD brains. In vitro experiments showed that the modification at position 23 greatly enhanced the aggregation of Abeta. Furthermore, systematic proline substitution analyses revealed that the beta-turn structure at positions 22 and 23 of Abeta42 plays a crucial role in the aggregation and neurotoxicity of Abeta peptides. It is suggested that spontaneous isomerization at position 23 induces the conformational change to form a beta-turn at position 23, which plays a pathogenic role in the deposition of Abeta peptides in sporadic AD. Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is a putative protein repair enzyme, which converts L-isoaspartyl residues in damaged proteins to normal L-aspartyl residues.

The exact mechanisms by which these compounds damage the dopamine system are not firmly established, but selective damage to dopamine neurons and inhibition of complex I are thought to be involved. We and others have previously documented that the toxic metabolite of MPTP, MPP+, is transported into dopamine neurons through the dopamine transporter (DAT), while rotenone is not transported by DAT. We have also demonstrated the requirement for complex I inhibition and oxidative damage in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration produced by rotenone. Based on structural similarity to MPP+, it has been proposed that paraquat exerts selective dopaminergic toxicity through transport by the DAT and subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. In this study we report that paraquat is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of DAT. We also demonstrate that in vivo exposure to MPTP and rotenone, but not paraquat, inhibits binding of 3H-dihydrorotenone to complex I in brain mitochondria. Rotenone and MPP+ were both effective inhibitors of complex I activity in isolated brain mitochondria, while paraquat exhibited weak inhibitory effects only at millimolar concentrations.

However, these neural progenitors have the potential to differentiate along glial or neuronal lineages. To evaluate the potential of NSFCs to form motoneurons, transcription factors Olig2, Ngn2, and HB9 were introduced into NSFCs to determine if their expression is sufficient for motoneuron specification and differentiation, as has been shown in the early development of the avian and murine central nervous systems in vivo. NSFCs transfected with Olig2, Ngn2, and HB9 alone exhibited no phenotypic lineage restriction. In contrast, simultaneous transfection of Ngn2 and HB9 cDNA increased the expression of Isl1/2, a motoneuron marker, when the cells were maintained in medium supplemented with retinoic acid, forskolin, and sonic hedgehog. Furthermore, a population of Olig2-expressing NSFCs also expressed Ngn2. Cotransfection of NSFCs with Olig2 and HB9, but not Olig2 and Ngn2, increased Isl1/2 expression. Coculture of NSFCs trans-fected with Ngn2-HB92 or Olig2 and HB9 with purified chicken skeletal muscle demonstrated frequent contacts that resembled neuromuscular junctions. These studies demonstrate that transcription factors governing the early development of chick and mouse motoneuron formation are able to drive human adult olfactory neuroepithelial progenitors to differentiate into motoneurons in vitro.

These lesions contain fibrillar deposits of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and the British dementia peptide (ABri), respectively. Both peptides are toxic to cells in culture, and there is increasing evidence that early 'soluble oligomers' are the toxic entity rather than mature amyloid fibrils. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this toxicity are not clear, but in the case of Abeta, one prominent hypothesis is that the peptide can induce oxidative damage via the formation of hydrogen peroxide. We have developed a reliable method, employing electron spin resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with the spin-trapping technique, to detect any hydrogen peroxide generated during the incubation of Abeta and other amyloidogenic peptides. Here, we monitored levels of hydrogen peroxide accumulation during different stages of aggregation of Abeta-(1-40) and ABri and found that in both cases it was generated as a short 'burst' early on in the aggregation process. Ultrastructural studies with both peptides revealed that structures resembling 'soluble oligomers' or 'protofibrils' were present during this early phase of hydrogen peroxide formation. Mature amyloid fibrils derived from Abeta-(1-40) did not generate hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that hydrogen peroxide formation during the early stages of protein aggregation may be a common mechanism of cell death in these (and possibly other) neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

In eukaryotic cells, this type of linkage is found in stalled topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, and Tdp1 has been implicated in the repair of such complexes in vivo. We confirm here that the Tdp1 catalytic cycle involves a covalent reaction intermediate in which a histidine residue is connected to a DNA 3'-phosphate through a phosphoamide linkage. Most surprisingly, this linkage can be hydrolyzed by Tdp1, and unlike a topoisomerase I-DNA complex, which requires modification to be an efficient substrate for Tdp1, the native form of Tdp1 can be removed from the DNA. The spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy neurodegenerative disease is caused by the H493R mutant form of Tdp1, which shows reduced enzymatic activity and accumulates the Tdp1-DNA covalent intermediate. The ability of wild type Tdp1 to remove the stalled mutant protein from the DNA likely explains the recessive nature of spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy. In addition to its activity on phosphotyrosine and phosphohistidine substrates, Tdp1 also possesses a limited DNA and RNA 3'-exonuclease activity in which a single nucleoside is removed from the 3'-hydroxyl end of the substrate. Furthermore, Tdp1 also removes a 3' abasic site and an artificial 3'-biotin adduct from the DNA. In combination with earlier data showing that Tdp1 can use 3'-phosphoglycolate as a substrate, these data suggest that Tdp1 may function to remove a variety of 3' adducts from DNA during DNA repair.</AbstractText>"}

This polymorphism is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that the 10398A allele is also associated with breast cancer susceptibility. African mitochondria harbor the 10398A allele less frequently than Caucasian mitochondria, which predominantly carry this allele. Mitochondrial genotypes at this locus were therefore determined in two separate populations of African-American women with invasive breast cancer and in controls.

Two models of developmental pesticide exposures in mice are presented here that yield PD phenotypes consistent with this possibility. Combined exposures to the herbicide paraquat (PQ) and the fungicide maneb (MB), both of which adversely affect dopamine systems, administered from postnatal days 5-19, produced selective losses of dopamine and metabolites and reduced numbers of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Effects were greater than those produced by adult-only exposures. Moreover, developmental PQ + MB exposures enhanced vulnerability to this pesticide regimen when administered subsequently in adulthood. In a second model, exposure to MB from gestational days 10-17 markedly increased vulnerability to PQ exposures during adulthood, with reductions in dopamine and metabolites and numbers of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Females evidenced protection in both models. Collectively, these models demonstrate that developmental exposures can produce progressive, permanent, and cumulative neurotoxicity of the nigrostriatal dopamine system and enhance vulnerability to subsequent environmental insults. Finally, effects of PQ + MB were greater than those of either pesticide alone in the postnatal model. This is consistent with a multiple-hit hypothesis predicting that multiple concurrent insults occurring at different target sites within a system (here nigrostriatal dopamine) may constrict the range and flexibility of compensatory mechanisms, thereby compromising the integrity and viability of the system. As such, this hypothesis presents a biologic strategy for identifying potentially significant neurotoxic mixtures for hazard identification in future studies.</AbstractText>"}

In this article we hypothesize that environmental exposures in early life may be of particular etiologic importance and review evidence for the early environmental origins of neurodegeneration. For PD the first recognized environmental cause, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), was identified in epidemiologic studies of drug abusers. Chemicals experimentally linked to PD include the insecticide rotenone and the herbicides paraquat and maneb; interaction has been observed between paraquat and maneb. In epidemiologic studies, manganese has been linked to parkinsonism. In dementia, lead is associated with increased risk in chronically exposed workers. Exposures of children in early life to lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, and methylmercury have been followed by persistent decrements in intelligence that may presage dementia. To discover new environmental causes of AD and PD, and to characterize relevant gene-environment interactions, we recommend that a large, prospective genetic and epidemiologic study be undertaken that will follow thousands of children from conception (or before) to old age. Additional approaches to etiologic discovery include establishing incidence registries for AD and PD, conducting targeted investigations in high-risk populations, and improving testing of the potential neurologic toxicity of chemicals.</AbstractText>"}

The activity of ATM kinase is activated by DNA damage, and this activation is required for cells to survive genotoxic events. In addition to this well characterized role in DNA repair, we now demonstrate a novel role for ATM in the retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells into post-mitotic, neuronal-like cells. RA rapidly activates the activity of ATM kinase, leading to the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the CREB protein, extrusion of neuritic processes, and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into neuronal-like cells. When ATM protein expression was suppressed by short hairpin RNA, the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CREB was blocked. Furthermore, ATM-negative cells failed to differentiate into neuronal-like cells when exposed to retinoic acid; instead, they underwent cell death. Expression of a constitutively active CREBVP16 construct, or exposure to forskolin to induce CREB phosphorylation, rescued ATM negative cells and restored differentiation. Furthermore, when dominant negative CREB proteins with mutations in either the CREB phosphorylation site (CREBS133A) or the DNA binding domain (KCREB) were introduced into SH-SY5Y cells, retinoic acid-induced differentiation was blocked and the cells underwent cell death. The results demonstrate that ATM is required for the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells through the ATM dependent-phosphorylation of serine 133 of CREB. These results therefore define a novel mechanism for activation of the activity of ATM kinase by RA, and implicate ATM in the regulation of CREB function during RA-induced differentiation.</AbstractText>"}

Abeta progressively accumulates in mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial toxicity. Interaction of mitochondrial Abeta with mitochondrial enzymes such as amyloid beta binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) exaggerates mitochondrial stress by inhibiting the enzyme activity, releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and affecting glycolytic, Krebs cycle and/or the respiratory chain pathways through the accumulation of deleterious intermediate metabolites.

In this study we report that acrolein also decreases PC12 cell viability in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Specifically, acrolein-induced cell death, mainly necrosis, is accompanied by the accumulation of cellular ROS. Elevating ROS scavengers can alleviate acrolein-induced cell death. Furthermore, we show that exposure to acrolein leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, denoted by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reduction of cellular oxygen consumption, and decrease of ATP level. This raises the possibility that the cellular accumulation of ROS could result from the increased production of ROS in the mitochondria of PC12 cells as a result of exposure to acrolein. The acrolein-induced significant decrease of ATP production in mitochondria may also explain why necrosis, not apoptosis, is the dominant type of cell death. In conclusion, our data suggest that one possible mechanism of acrolein-induced cell death could be through mitochondria as its initial target. The subsequent increase of ROS then inflicts cell death and further worsens mitochondria function. Such mechanism may play an important role in CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

This accumulation arises from an imbalance between the load of proteins that need to be folded and processed in the ER lumen and the ER folding/processing capacity. To withstand such potentially lethal conditions, stress responses are activated that includes the shutdown of translation to reduce the ER work load and the activation of the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in the folding and processing reactions, to increase folding/processing capacity. In transient cerebral ischemia, ER stress-induced suppression of protein synthesis is believed to be too severe to permit sufficient activation of the genetic arm of the ER stress response. Mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease down-regulate the ER stress response and make cells more vulnerable to conditions associated with ER stress. When the functioning of the ER is severely impaired and affected cells can no longer withstand these stressful conditions, programmed cell death is induced, including a mitochondria-driven apoptotic pathway. Raising the resistance of cells to conditions that interfere with ER functions and activating the degradation and refolding of unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER lumen are possible strategies for blocking the pathological process leading to cell death at an early stage.</AbstractText>"}

In rats, the fall in cholinergic and GABAergic markers due to the excitotoxic death of intrinsic neurons caused by intrastriatal infusion of the neurotoxin, ibotenic acid, was significantly prevented by long-term dietary supplementation with creatine. On the contrary, creatine was unable to recover a cholinergic marker in the cortex of rats subjected to the excitotoxic death of the cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. In G93A mice, long-term creatine supplementation marginally but significantly increased mean lifespan, as previously observed by others, and reverted the cholinergic deficit present in some forebrain areas at an intermediate stage of the disease. In both rats and mice, creatine supplementation increased the activity of the GABAergic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase, in the striatum but not in other brain regions.

Systemic administration of 3-NP in rats serves as an important model of HD. The animals received subcutaneous injections of nicotine (0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 mg/kg) daily for 7 days. 3-NP (25 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered daily 30 min after nicotine for the same duration. One additional group of rats served as control (vehicle only). On day 8, the animals were observed for neurobehavioral performance (motor activity, inclined plane test, grip strength test, paw test and beam balance). Immediately after behavioral studies, the animals were transcardially perfused with neutral buffered formalin (10%) and brains were fixed for histological studies. Lesions in the striatal dopaminergic neurons were assessed by immunohistochemical method using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining. Treatment of rats with nicotine significantly and dose-dependently attenuated 3-NP-induced behavioral deficits. Administration of 3-NP alone caused significant depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) and glutathione (GSH), which was significantly and dose-dependently attenuated by nicotine. Preservation of striatal dopaminergic neurons by nicotine was also confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. These results clearly showed neuroprotective effect of nicotine in experimental model of HD.

It has, however, been mapped to a genomic region not harboring the bovine orthologue of the SMN gene, mutation of which causes human SMA. After refinement of the mapping results we analyzed positional and functional candidate genes. One of three candidate genes, FVT1, encoding 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, which catalyzes a crucial step in the glycosphingolipid metabolism, showed a G-to-A missense mutation that changes Ala-175 to Thr. The identified mutation is limited to SMA-affected animals and carriers and always appears in context of the founder haplotype. The Ala variant found in healthy animals showed the expected 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase activity in an in vitro enzyme assay. Importantly, the Thr variant found in SMA animals showed no detectable activity. Surprisingly, in an in vivo assay the mutated gene complements the growth defect of a homologous yeast knockout strain as well as the healthy variant. This finding explains the viability of affected newborn calves and the later neuron-specific onset of the disease, which might be due to the high sensitivity of these neurons to changes in housekeeping functions. Taken together, the described mutation in FVT1 is a strong candidate for causality of SMA in cattle. This result provides an animal model for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the development of SMA and will allow efficient selection against the disease in cattle.</AbstractText>"}

In order to address the question of whether this down-regulation is a necessary prerequisite for the myelination process, transgenic mice expressing the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV under the control of the proteolipid protein promoter were generated. In these mice, postnatal down-regulation of PSA in oligodendrocytes was abolished. Most NCAM-120, the characteristic NCAM isoform in oligodendrocytes, carried PSA in the transgenic mice at all stages of postnatal development. Polysialylated NCAM-120 partially co-localized with myelin basic protein and was present in purified myelin. The permanent expression of PSA-NCAM in oligodendrocytes led to a reduced myelin content in the forebrains of transgenic mice during the period of active myelination and in the adult animal. In situ hybridizations indicated a significant decrease in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the forebrain. Thus, down-regulation of PSA during oligodendrocyte differentiation is a prerequisite for efficient myelination by mature oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, myelin of transgenic mice exhibited structural abnormalities like redundant myelin and axonal degeneration, indicating that the down-regulation of PSA is also necessary for myelin maintenance.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated whether 30 days exposure of noise can produce an oxidative stress. Further, if yes then, could alpha-asarone counteract the stress. This was verified by measuring the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), Vitamin C, Vitamin E, protein thiols and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in different regions of the rat brain. All the three doses of alpha-asarone had an effectively protective role by normalizing the increased SOD and LPO, decreased CAT, GPx, GSH, Vitamins C and E and protein thiols due to noise exposure. Thus, action of alpha-asarone against noise-stress may be due its antioxidant property. Our data proved that antioxidant property of alpha-asarone against noise-stress induced changes in the rat brain. Further, more clinical studies are required to investigate effectiveness of the alpha-asarone in noisy environment in human subjects.</AbstractText>"}

This study examined cell death in the retina after chronic elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) in an experimental rat model of human glaucomatous disease. Three episcleral veins on the ocular surface of rats were cauterized. Activation of several cell death programs represented by Fas ligand, FADD (Fas Associated Death Domain/Mort1) and the caspase cascade (caspase-8 and -3) and survival programs represented by phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), Bcl-2 associated death domain (BAD), and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) were examined using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Following injury, two major events occurred simultaneously in the retina: activation of programmed cell death pathways and activation of survival mechanisms to maintain the cellular homeostasis of the retina. At the later stage of injury, markers of an activated cell death program appeared to be concentrated in the retinal ganglion cells. In conclusion, we suggest that endogenous cell survival factors triggered at the early stage of injury play a critical role in control of the death or survival of retinal ganglion cells and that the manipulation of this decision phase is one of the therapeutic targets for glaucoma.</AbstractText>"}

Natural plant extracts of Lycium barbarum are well-known to exhibit anti-aging effects. We therefore hypothesized that they exhibit neuroprotective effects against toxins in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether extracts from L. barbarum have neuroprotective effects against toxicity of fibrillar Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(25-35) fragments. Primary rat cortical neurons exposed to Abeta peptides resulted in apoptosis and necrosis. Pre-treatment with extract isolated from L. barbarum significantly reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, it attenuated Abeta peptide-activated caspases-3-like activity. The extract elicited a typical dose-dependent neuroprotective effect. Effective dosage of this extract was wider than that of a well-known western neuroprotective medicine lithium chloride (LiCl). We have further examined the underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects. In agreement with other laboratories, Abeta peptides induce a rapid activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by phosphorylation. Pre-treatment of aqueous extract markedly reduced the phosphorylation of JNK-1 (Thr183/Tyr185) and its substrates c-Jun-I (Ser 73) and c-Jun-II (Ser 63). Taken together, we have proved our hypothesis by showing neuroprotective effects of the extract from L. barbarum. Study on anti-aging herbal medicine like L. barbarum may open a new therapeutic window for the prevention of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Exposure to several common environmental toxins acting through oxidative stress has been shown to be associated with PD. One recently identified inherited PD gene, DJ-1, may have a role in protection from oxidative stress, thus potentially linking a genetic cause with critical environmental risk factors. To develop an animal model that would allow integrative study of genetic and environmental influences, we have generated Drosophila lacking DJ-1 function. Fly DJ-1 homologs exhibit differential expression: DJ-1beta is ubiquitous, while DJ-1alpha is predominantly expressed in the male germline. DJ-1alpha and DJ-1beta double knockout flies are viable, fertile, and have a normal lifespan; however, they display a striking selective sensitivity to those environmental agents, including paraquat and rotenone, linked to PD in humans. This sensitivity results primarily from loss of DJ-1beta protein, which also becomes modified upon oxidative stress. These studies demonstrate that fly DJ-1 activity is selectively involved in protection from environmental oxidative insult in vivo and that the DJ-1beta protein is biochemically responsive to oxidative stress. Study of these flies will provide insight into the critical interplay of genetics and environment in PD.</AbstractText>"}

Paradoxically, most methods developed to study these changes are static and do not provide insights on the dynamics of the sequela of steps involved in tumorigenesis. This major shortcoming now can be overcome with the application of reporter genes and imaging technologies, which are providing tools to examine specific molecular events and their role in the carcinogenic process in single cells. In the last decade reporter-based biosensors were created to study gene transcription, protein/protein interactions, sub-cellular trafficking and protease activities; this wealth of systems enable to monitor intracellular signaling pathways at several key check points specifically involved in cancer cell development. The challenge is now to extend cell-based models to the generation of reporter mice, where non-invasive in vivo imaging technologies allow to follow single molecular events. When combined with murine models of cancer, these technologies will give an unprecedented opportunity to spatio-temporally investigate the molecular events resulting in neoplasia. The aim of the present review is to highlight the major changes occurring in this rapidly evolving field and their potential for increasing our knowledge in cancer biology and for the research of novel and more efficacious therapies.</AbstractText>"}

Whether these aggregates are pathogenic, or the consequence of a molecular defense mechanism, remains controversial in the field of neurodegenerative disorders and OPMD. Our cellular model shows that interfering with the formation of expPABPN1-induced large nuclear aggregates increases the availability of nuclear expPABPN1 and significantly exacerbates cell death. Live microscopy reveals that cells harboring an increased amount of the soluble forms of expPABPN1 are significantly more prone to toxicity than those with nuclear aggregates.

Moreover, a reduced expression of the enzyme converting Tinto DHT (i.e., the 5alpha-reductase) also occurs at the level of sciatic nerve, suggesting that the decrease of DHT levels could be due to an impairment of this enzyme. Chronic treatment for 1 month with DHT or 3alpha-diol increased tail nerve conduction velocity and partially counteracted the increase of thermal threshold induced by diabetes. Treatment with DHT increased tibial Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and the expression of myelin protein P0 in the sciatic nerve.DHT, 3alpha-diol and T reversed the reduction of intra-epidermal nerve fiber density induced by diabetes.

The combined use of kinematics and kinetics methods, mainly based on high speed video analysis and forceplate, have permitted a comprehensive description of locomotion process in terms of energetics and biomechanics. While the different phases of a single gait cycle are well understood, there is an increasing interest to know how the neuro-motor system controls gait form stride to stride. Indeed, it was observed that neurodegenerative diseases and aging could impact gait stability and gait parameters steadiness. From both clinical and fundamental research perspectives, there is therefore a need to develop techniques to accurately track gait parameters stride-by-stride over a long period with minimal constraints to patients. In this context, high accuracy satellite positioning can provide an alternative tool to monitor outdoor walking. Indeed, the high-end GPS receivers provide centimeter accuracy positioning with 5-20 Hz sampling rate: this allows the stride-by-stride assessment of a number of basic gait parameters--such as walking speed, step length and step frequency--that can be tracked over several thousand consecutive strides in free-living conditions. Furthermore, long-range correlations and fractal-like pattern was observed in those time series. As compared to other classical methods, GPS seems a promising technology in the field of gait variability analysis. However, relative high complexity and expensiveness--combined with a usability which requires further improvement--remain obstacles to the full development of the GPS technology in human applications.</AbstractText>"}

Ncr1p localizes to the vacuole, the yeast equivalent to the mammalian endosome-lysosome system. Here, we identify the first phenotype caused by deletion of NCR1 from the yeast genome, resistance to the ether lipid drug, edelfosine. Our results indicate that edelfosine has a cytotoxic, rather than cytostatic, effect on wildtype yeast cells. We exploit the edelfosine resistance phenotype to assess the function of yeast Ncr1 proteins carrying amino acid changes corresponding to human NPC1 patient mutations. We find that one of these amino acid changes severely compromises Ncr1p function as assessed using the edelfosine resistance assay.

Diagnosis was based on elevated N-acetylaspartate in urine, reduced aspartoacylase activity in fibroblasts, and marked white matter changes on cerebral imaging. All three affected individuals exhibited continuous psychomotor development without any regression. Genetic analyses revealed compound heterozygous mutations (Y288 C; F295 S) in two individuals. The Y288 C variant was previously described in a child with macrocephaly, mild developmental delay, increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia, partial cortical blindness and retinitis pigmentosa, and slightly elevated N-acetylaspartate in the urine. Demonstration of the same variant in two unusually mildly affected Canavan disease patients and absence of this variant in 154 control chromosomes suggest a possible pathogenic role in mild Canavan disease.

Long Evans rat pups were given a single intracerebral injection of recombinant plasmid DNA containing the human NOS3 cDNA (p-hNOS3) or the luciferase (p-Luc) gene as a negative control, and complexed with polyamine reagent. Overexpression of NOS3 in the brain increased the levels of APP, APP-Abeta, p53, Tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) delta and gamma and decreased the levels of Hu (neuronal marker) mRNA, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, ATP synthase, and choline acetyltransferase expression as demonstrated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, or immunohistochemical staining. These effects of NOS3 overexpression were accompanied by increased single-stranded DNA immunoreactivity, reflecting DNA damage. The results suggest that increased cerebral expression of NOS3 causes several molecular abnormalities related to AD-type neurodegeneration, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired acetylcholine homeostasis.

In all of the neurodegenerative diseases examined to date, transglutaminase enzyme activity is upregulated in selectively vulnerable brain regions, transglutaminase proteins are associated with inclusion bodies characteristic of the diseases, and prominent proteins in the inclusion bodies are modified by transglutaminase enzymes. These prominent proteins in the inclusion bodies, including tau, alpha-synuclein, and huntingtin protein, are modified by transglutaminase in vitro and alpha-synuclein and huntingtin protein are modified in cells in culture.

ATP7A expression in neurons was developmentally regulated rather than constitutively. Initially expressed in the cell bodies of developing neurons, ATP7A protein later shifted to extending axons, peaking prior to synaptogenesis. Similarly, after injury-stimulated neurogenesis, ATP7A expression increased in neurons and axons preceding synaptogenesis. Interestingly, copper-transport-deficient ATP7A still exhibits axonal localization.

The dual-labeled FA binding protein was used in lifetime-assisted ratiometric sensing (LARS) of oleic acid. For both steady-state and time-resolved luminescence decay experiments, the protein is responsive to oleic acid in the range of 0.02-4.7 microM. The emission at 432 nm, which is associated with the acrylodan occupying the FA binding site, decreases in intensity and red shifts to 505 nm on the addition of oleic acid. The intensities of the 505-nm peak due to the acrylodan displaced from the binding site by FA and of the 610-nm emission peak of ruthenium remained nearly unchanged. Fitting of the fluorescence decay data using the method of least squares revealed three emitting components with lifetimes of approximately 0.60, 4.00, and 370 ns. Fractional intensities of the emitting species indicate that changes in modulation between 2 and 10 MHz on binding of the protein with oleic acid are due mainly to the 4.00-ns component. The 0.60- and 370-ns components are assigned to acrylodan (505 nm) and ruthenium, respectively. Note that because ruthenium has a lifetime that is two orders of magnitude longer than that of acrylodan, the FA measurements were carried out at excitation frequencies lower than what can be done with acrylodan alone. Thus, low-cost instrumentation can be designed for a practical FA sensor without sacrificing the quality of measurements.</AbstractText>"}

Activated astrocytes and focal clusters of activated microglia were present in outer layers of occipital and somatosensory cortical regions as early as 12 days of age, together with activated perivascular macrophages. Astrocytic activation and progressive transformation of microglia to brain macrophages preceded neurodegeneration and spread to different cortical areas, most prominently in regions associated with clinical symptoms. In contrast, storage body accumulation was much more evenly spread across regions. These data support suggestions that neurodegeneration and storage body accumulation may be independent manifestations of CLN6 mutation and indicate that glial cell activation may be an important mediator in pathogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

On MRI, atrophy is the primary hallmark of neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer's disease (AD), while vascular dementia is characterized by the presence of ischemic vascular damage, such as territorial infarcts, lacunes, and white matter hyperintensities. Evidence is accumulating that vascular factors play an important role in the development of cognitive decline at old age and clinical AD. In the present article we present results of four recent MRI studies suggesting the additional involvement of small vessel disease in neurodegenerative disorders. Atrophy in the medial temporal lobe, as typically observed in AD, and small vessel disease often coincide. In terms of clinical significance, their effects may even be synergistic. The strict distinction between AD and vascular dementia is often artificial, as most patients suffer from both disorders to some extent. For the future, we see an important role for MRI in identifying those different compartments, regardless of clinical classification.

We describe three novel brain mapping techniques, cortical thickness mapping, tensor-based morphometry (TBM), and hippocampal surface modeling, which offer enormous power for measuring disease progression in drug trials, and shed light on the neuroscience of brain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We report the first time-lapse maps of cortical atrophy spreading dynamically in the living brain, based on averaging data from populations of subjects with Alzheimer's disease and normal subjects imaged longitudinally with MRI. These dynamic sequences show a rapidly advancing wave of cortical atrophy sweeping from limbic and temporal cortices into higher-order association and ultimately primary sensorimotor areas, in a pattern that correlates with cognitive decline. A complementary technique, TBM, reveals the 3D profile of atrophic rates, at each point in the brain. A third technique, hippocampal surface modeling, plots the profile of shape alterations across the hippocampal surface. The three techniques provide moderate to highly automated analyses of images, have been validated on hundreds of scans, and are sensitive to clinically relevant changes in individual patients and groups undergoing different drug treatments. We compare time-lapse maps of AD, MCI, and other dementias, correlate these changes with cognition, and relate them to similar time-lapse maps of childhood development, schizophrenia, and HIV-associated brain degeneration. Strengths and weaknesses of these different imaging measures for basic neuroscience and drug trials are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

We have found that the specific regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortices are critical for successful memory in both young and healthy older subjects. Our fMRI studies, as well as those of several other groups, have consistently demonstrated that, compared to cognitively intact older subjects, patients with clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) have decreased fMRI activation in the hippocampus and related structures within the medial temporal lobe during the encoding of new memories.

The terminology relating to RBD, and mechanisms underlying REM sleep without atonia and RBD based on data in cat and rat are presented. Neuroimaging data from the few published human cases with RBD associated with structural lesions in the brainstem are presented, in which the dorsal midbrain and pons are implicated. Pharmacological manipulations which alter RBD frequency and severity are reviewed, and the data from human neuropathological studies are presented. An anatomic framework and new schema for the pathophysiology of RBD are proposed based on recent data in rat regarding the putative flip-flop switch for REM sleep control. The structure in man analogous to the subcoeruleus region in cat and sublaterodorsal nucleus in rat is proposed as the nucleus (and its associated efferent and afferent pathways) crucial to RBD pathophysiology. The association of RBD with neurological disease ('secondary RBD') is presented, with emphasis on RBD associated with neurodegenerative disease, particularly the synucleinopathies. The hypothesized pathophysiology of RBD is presented in relation to the Braak staging system for Parkinson's disease, in which the topography and temporal sequence of synuclein pathology in the brain could explain the evolution of parkinsonism and/or dementia well after the onset of RBD. These data suggest that many patients with 'idiopathic' RBD are actually exhibiting an early clinical manifestation of an evolving neurodegenerative disorder. Such patients may be appropriate for future drug therapies that affect synuclein pathophysiology, in which the development of parkinsonism and/or dementia could be delayed or prevented. We suggest that additional clinicopathological studies be performed in patients with dementia or parkinsonism, with and without RBD, as well as in patients with idiopathic RBD, to further elucidate the pathophysiology and also characterize the clinical and pathophysiological relevance of RBD in neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, longitudinal studies in patients with idiopathic RBD are warranted to characterize the natural history of such patients and prepare for future therapeutic trials.</AbstractText>"}

Neuropathological findings suggest severe neurodegeneration leading to a marked neuronal dropout of the entire central nervous system and atrophy. Similar neuropathological findings have been described in the Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS), an apparently different lethal malformation syndrome. Neuropathological similarities between OMIM 601160 and NLS raise the question of clinicopathological variability and genetic heterogeneity of type III lissencephaly. To answer this question, we compared our clinicopathological findings in a series of fetuses with OMIM 601160 to pathological data reported in NLS. In the study, 5 unrelated families with 7 affected fetuses were included. Interestingly, we found striking clinicopathological similarities between OMIM 601160 and NLS, which may represent a variability of a single neurodegenerative disease with early prenatal onset.

We report here the molecular background of this disease based on the positional cloning/candidate approach of the defective gene. Having established the linkage to chromosome 10q24, we restricted the critical DNA region using single nucleotide polymorphism-based haplotypes. After analyzing all positional candidate transcripts, we identified two point mutations in the gene C10orf2 encoding Twinkle, a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA)-specific helicase, and a rarer splice variant Twinky, underlying IOSCA. The founder IOSCA mutation, homozygous in all but one of the patients, leads to a Y508C amino acid change in the polypeptides. One patient, heterozygous for Y508C, carries a silent coding region cytosine to thymine transition mutation in his paternal disease chromosome. This allele is expressed at a reduced level, causing the preponderance of messenger RNAs encoding Y508C polypeptides and thus leads to the IOSCA disease phenotype. Previously, we have shown that different mutations in this same gene cause autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) with multiple mtDNA deletions (MIM 606075), a neuromuscular disorder sharing a spectrum of symptoms with IOSCA. IOSCA phenotype is the first recessive one due to Twinkle and Twinky mutations, the dominant PEO mutations affecting mtDNA maintenance, but in IOSCA, mtDNA stays intact. The severe neurological phenotype observed in IOSCA, a result of only a single amino acid substitution in Twinkle and Twinky, suggests that these proteins play a crucial role in the maintenance and/or function of specific affected neuronal subpopulations.</AbstractText>"}

This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of an intranigral microinjection of serofendic acid based on behavioral, neurochemical and histochemical studies in hemi-parkinsonian rats using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Rats were injected with 6-OHDA in the presence or absence of serofendic acid, or were treated with serofendic acid on the same lateral side, at 12, 24 or 72 h after 6-OHDA lesion. Intranigral injection of 6-OHDA alone induced a massive loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Either simultaneous or 12 h post-administration of serofendic acid significantly prevented both dopaminergic neurodegeneration and drug-induced rotational asymmetry. Immunoreactivities for oxidative stress markers, such as 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), were markedly detected in the SNpc of rats injected with 6-OHDA alone. These immunoreactivities were markedly suppressed by the co-administration of serofendic acid, similar to the results in vehicle-treated control rats. In addition, serofendic acid inhibited 6-OHDA-induced alpha-synuclein expression and glial activation in the SNpc. These results suggest that serofendic acid protects against 6-OHDA-induced SNpc dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

However, the upstream mediators of cell death remain largely unknown. One approach to the identification of upstream mediators is to perform gene expression analysis in disease models. Such analyses, performed in tissue culture models induced by neurotoxins, have identified up-regulation of CHOP/GADD153, a transcription factor implicated in apoptosis due to endoplasmic reticulum stress or oxidative injury. To evaluate the disease-related significance of these findings, we have examined the expression of CHOP/GADD153 in neurotoxin models of parkinsonism in living animals. Nuclear expression of CHOP protein is observed in developmental and adult models of dopamine neuron death induced by intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) and in models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). CHOP is a mediator of neuron death in the adult 60HDA model because a null mutation results in a reduction in apoptosis. In the chronic MPTP model, however, while CHOP is robustly expressed, the null mutation does not protect from the loss of neurons. We conclude that the role of CHOP depends on the nature of the toxic stimulus. For 6OHDA, an oxidative metabolite of dopamine, it is a mediator of apoptotic death.</AbstractText>"}

Thus VPS needs to be differentiated from other disturbances, which have distinct phenomenological and therapeutical features including isolated gait disturbances associated with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy and neurodegenerative parkinsonism complicated by comorbid vascular encephalopathy. Acute or subacute VPS is usually caused by contralateral infarctions involving the external globus pallidus, ventrolateral thalamus, and, less often, the substantia nigra. Chronic VPS with insidious onset is related to bilateral subcortical infarctions affecting thalamocortical projections. Differentiation from degenerative parkinsonism is difficult in cases of VPS that display a progressive course and response to levodopa.</AbstractText>"}

Minocycline has been shown to have neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in certain neural injury and neurodegenerative disease models. This study examined the effects of minocycline administration on the quality and longevity of chronic multi-channel microwire neural implants 1 week and 1 month post-implantation in auditory cortex. The mean signal-to-noise ratio for the minocycline group stabilized at the end of week 1 and remained above 4.6 throughout the following 3 weeks. The control group signal-to-noise ratio dropped throughout the duration of the study and at the end of 4 weeks was 2.6. Furthermore, 68% of electrodes from the minocycline group showed significant stimulus-driven activity at week 4 compared to 12.5% of electrodes in the control group. There was a significant reduction in the number of activated astrocytes around the implant in minocycline subjects, as well as a reduction in total area occupied by activated astrocytes at 1 and 4 weeks.</AbstractText>"}

These include the alpha6beta2(*) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are localized exclusively on dopamine terminals in striatum ((*)denotes the presence of possible additional subunits). In this study, we used a novel alpha-conotoxin MII (alpha-CtxMII) analog E11A to further investigate alpha6beta2(*) nAChR subtypes in mouse, monkey, and human striatum. Receptor competition studies with (125)I-alpha-CtxMII showed that E11A inhibition curves were biphasic, suggesting the presence of two distinct alpha6beta2(*) nAChR subtypes. These include a very high (femtomolar) and a high (picomolar) affinity site, with approximately 40% of the sites in the very high affinity form. It is noteworthy that only the high-affinity form was detected in alpha4 nAChR-null mutant mice. Because (125)I-alpha-CtxMII binds primarily to alpha6alpha4beta2beta3 and alpha6beta2beta3 nAChR subtypes in mouse striatum, these data suggest that the population lost in the alpha4 knockout mice was the alpha6alpha4beta2beta3 subtype. We next investigated the effect of nigrostriatal lesioning on these two striatal alpha6beta2(*) populations in two animal models and in Parkinson's disease. There was a preferential loss of the very high affinity subtype in striatum of mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), monkeys treated with MPTP, and patients with Parkinson's disease. These data suggest that dopaminergic terminals expressing the alpha6alpha4beta2beta3 population are selectively vulnerable to nigrostriatal damage. This latter nAChR subtype, identified with alpha-CtxMII E11A, may therefore provide a unique marker for dopaminergic terminals particularly sensitive to nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

CLN1 encodes palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), suggesting an important role for the regulation of palmitoylation in normal neuronal function. To further elucidate Ppt1 function, we performed a gain-of-function modifier screen in Drosophila using a collection of enhancer-promoter transgenic lines to suppress or enhance the degeneration produced by overexpression of Ppt1 in the adult visual system. Modifier genes identified in our screen connect Ppt1 function to synaptic vesicle cycling, endo-lysosomal trafficking, synaptic development, and activity-dependent remodeling of the synapse. Furthermore, several homologs of the modifying genes are known to be regulated by palmitoylation in other systems and may be in vivo substrates for Ppt1. Our results complement recent work on mouse Ppt1(-/-) cells that shows a reduction in synaptic vesicle pools in primary neuronal cultures and defects in endosomal trafficking in human fibroblasts. The pathways and processes implicated by our modifier loci shed light on the normal cellular function of Ppt1. A greater understanding of Ppt1 function in these cellular processes will provide valuable insight into the molecular etiology of the neuronal dysfunction underlying the disease.</AbstractText>"}

The investigation of colocalization, and protein-protein interactions by Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime imaging showed that alpha-synuclein associates with the actin cytoskeleton and interacts with tau. The A30P mutation and cytoskeletal destabilization decreased this interaction.

Linkage analysis was performed between microsatellite markers of seven chromosomes, where the homologous genes of human neurodegenerative disorders are located according to comparative mapping data, and the disease genotype. BSMA was mapped to chromosome 24 confirming the recently published localization (Medugorac et al. 2003). The candidate gene AFG3L2 was physically mapped to chromosome 24q24 using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Due to their different localizations AFG3L2 is not a positional candidate for BSMA. An informative marker localized on the telomeric side of the BSMA locus would be beneficial for marker-assisted selection as well as searching for the causative gene.

Oral delivery of ethyl-EPA to symptomatic YAC128 mice beginning at 7 months of age increased membrane EPA levels 3-fold (P &lt; 0.001) and resulted in a modest but significant improvement in motor dysfunction by 12 months of age as measured by open-field activity (P = 0.01) and performance on the rotarod (P = 0.05). At this age, ethyl-EPA-treated YAC128 mice showed no improvement in striatal volume, striatal neuron counts, striatal neuronal cross-sectional area, or striatal DARPP-32 expression compared to untreated YAC128 mice, thereby indicating no reduction of striatal neuropathology. This result is congruent with modest motor benefits observed in HD patients treated with ethyl-EPA.

Research models for investigating protein glycation and its relationship to methylglyoxal metabolism are required to understand this process, its implications in cell biochemistry and their role in human diseases. We investigated methylglyoxal metabolism and protein glycation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a specific antibody against argpyrimidine, a marker of protein glycation by methylglyoxal, we found that yeast cells growing on d-glucose (100 mM) present several glycated proteins at the stationary phase of growth. Intracellular methylglyoxal concentration, determined by a specific HPLC based assay, is directly related to argpyrimidine formation. Moreover, exposing nongrowing yeast cells to a higher d-glucose concentration (250 mM) increases methylglyoxal formation rate and argpyrimidine modified proteins appear within 1 h. A kinetic model of methylglyoxal metabolism in yeast, comprising its nonenzymatic formation and enzymatic catabolism by the glutathione dependent glyoxalase pathway and aldose reductase, was used to probe the role of each system parameter on methylglyoxal steady-state concentration. Sensitivity analysis of methylglyoxal metabolism and studies with gene deletion mutant yeast strains showed that the glyoxalase pathway and aldose reductase are equally important for preventing protein glycation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</AbstractText>"}

Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on.

In FC, significant differences of Nv and Sv due to age were not revealed, while the S value was significantly increased in the aged animals. In TC, Sv did not change in relation to age, whereas Nv was significantly decreased and S significantly increased in aged monkeys. A percent distribution of S showed that the fraction of enlarged synapses (&gt;0.20 microm(2)) was higher in TC than in FC, regardless of the age of the animals (21.3% versus 16.9% in adult and 33.9% versus 26.0% in aged monkeys, respectively). In aged animals, Syn/Neur was not significantly decreased in TC and not significantly increased in FC (4.4%). The above morphometric parameters account for the ongoing rearrangements of synaptic ultrastructure, reacting to the environmental stimuli. Our findings provide evidence of an age-related decline of synaptic plasticity in the brain of aged monkeys that is statistically significant in TC. According to current literature data on synaptic structural dynamics, this decay may represent an early and subtle alteration able to trigger the development of senile plaques and neurodegenerative events.</AbstractText>"}

HIV-associated encephalitis (HAE), the neuropathology responsible for HIV-associated dementia, involves the formation of multinucleated giant cells or syncytia. In this article we describe the apoptotic pathways activated in the brains of HAE-affected patients. Approximately 50% of multinuclear giant cells exhibited apoptotic DNA fragmentation as detected by the terminal dUTP nick-end labeling technique. In addition, the presence of syncytia in the frontal cortex of approximately 35% of HAE patients correlated with the number of cells expressing the HIV-1 protein p24. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that HAE-associated syncytia underwent apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway previously delineated for HIV-1 envelope-elicited syncytia in vitro. We observed over-expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that mediates activation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor p53, and p53-dependent up-regulation of two effectors of mitochondrial apoptosis, namely the BH3-only proteins Puma and transglutaminase type 2 (TG2). Interestingly, although mTOR activation and Puma induction were observed in dying syncytia and neurons, IkB phosphorylation and TG2 up-regulation were only found in syncytia. These findings provide substantial new information on the cell death mechanisms that regulate HAE, suggesting an important pathogenetic role of syncytia in the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Autoimmunity, at least in the context of the CNS, is the body's fighting force against self-derived destructive compounds, and 'tolerance to self' (traditionally though mistakenly equated with nonresponsiveness) should be viewed as the ability to tolerate autoimmune responses without developing an autoimmune disease. This physiological repair mechanism is controlled by naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells), with an on/off switch regulated by brain-derived compounds. We suggest that ongoing neurodegeneration after acute injuries results from insufficiency of the endogenous fighting force, and chronic neurodegenerative diseases reflect age-related deterioration of the body's two principal regulators: the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system. If so, then the restoration or boosting of immune function might bridge the gap between such manifestations of CNS-related risk factors and the defensive capacity of the immune system. Boosting of peripheral immunity by the use of weak agonists of CNS self-antigens, might offer a promising potential therapy for different neurodegenerative conditions. This could be accomplished either by vaccination with a universal weak T cell-reactive antigen or with altered peptide ligands of self-antigens, or by weakening the suppressive effect of autoimmunity (e.g., by eliminating Treg cells). T cells that home to the damaged CNS might then help restore local homeostasis by controlling the local microglial response. Because neurodegenerative diseases possess common features (deriving from the local chaos), the same vaccine might protect against several different disorders associated with impaired motor, sensory, cognitive, or mental functions of the brain.</AbstractText>"}

Recent evidence for the involvement of sgk1 in the early pathogenesis of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) prompted us to investigate in more detail its expression and role in animal models of different neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that transcription of sgk1 is increased in several animal models of PD and a transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The upregulation of sgk1 strongly correlates with the occurrence of cell death. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 and some of the voltage-gated potassium channels are physiological substrates of sgk1 in vivo. Using a small interfering RNA approach to silence sgk1 transcripts in vitro, we give evidence that sgk1 exerts a protective role in oxidative stress situations. These findings underline a key role for sgk1 in the molecular pathway of cell death, in which sgk1 seems to exert a protective role.</AbstractText>"}

Draft of a comprehensive theory for Alzheimer disease.","Journal":"Medical hypotheses","Date":"2005","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>A comprehensive theory for Alzheimer disease (AD) which can provide a clue to the neuronal selective vulnerability (pathoklisis) is still missing. Based upon evidence from the current literature, the present work is aimed at proposing such a theory, namely the 'aminergic disinhibition theory' of AD. It includes data-based hypotheses as to the pathoklisis, mechanisms of neuro-degeneration and dementia as well as the aetiology of the disease. Alzheimer disease is regarded as a disorder of neural input modulation caused by the degeneration of four modulatory amine transmitter (MAT) systems, namely the serotoninergic, the noradrenergic, the histaminergic, and the cholinergic systems with ascending projections. MATs modulate cognitive processing including arousal, attention, and synaptic plasticity in learning and memory, not only through direct, mostly inhibitory impact on principal neurones but also partially through interaction with local networks of GABA-ergic inter-neurones. The distribution and magnitude of the pathology in AD roughly correlate with the distribution and magnitude of MAT modulation: Regions more densely innervated by ascending MAT projections are, as a rule, more severely affected than areas receiving less MAT innervation. Because the global effect of MATs in the forebrain is inhibition, the degeneration of four MAT systems, some related peptidergic systems and a secondary alleviation of the GABA-ergic transmission means a fundamental loss of inhibitory impact in the neuronal circuitry resulting in neuronal (aminergic) disinhibition. Clearly, the basic mechanism promoting neuronal death in AD is thought to be a chronic disturbance of the inhibition-excitation balance to the advantage of excitation. Chronic over-excitation is conceived to result in Ca2+ dependent cellular excito-toxicity leading to neuro-degeneration including amyloid-beta production and NFT formation. Disinhibited neurons will degenerate while less excited (relatively over-inhibited) neurones will survive. Because the decline of aminergic transmission in AD is likely to start at the receptor level, it is hypothesized that early impairment by a molecular 'hit' to an MAT receptor (or a group of receptors) initiates a pathogenetic cascade that develops in an avalanche-like manner. Based on experimental evidence from the literature, the 'hit' might be the attachment of a targeted pathogen like a small roaming amino acid sequence to the receptor(s), e.g., the serotoninergic 5-HT2A-R. Referential sequence analysis could be a means to identify such a small pathogen hidden in a large receptor molecule.</AbstractText>"}

UBB(+1) is a substrate for proteasomal degradation, however it can also inhibit the proteasome. Here, we show that UBB(+1) properties shift from substrate to inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner in cell culture using an inducible UBB(+1) expression system. At low expression levels, UBB(+1) was efficiently degraded by the proteasome. At high levels, the proteasome failed to degrade UBB(+1), causing its accumulation, which subsequently induced a reversible functional impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Also in brain slice cultures, UBB(+1) accumulation and concomitant proteasome inhibition was only induced at high expression levels. Our findings show that by varying UBB(+1) expression levels, the dual proteasome substrate and inhibitory properties can be optimally used to serve as a research tool to study the ubiquitin-proteasome system and to further elucidate the role of aberrations of this pathway in disease.</AbstractText>"}

In the past decade or so, in spite of the molecular cloning of the five dopamine receptor subtypes, their specific roles in brain function remained inconclusive due to the lack of completely selective ligands that could distinguish between the members of the D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptor families. One of the most important advances in the field of dopamine research has been the generation of mutant mouse models permitting evaluation of the dopaminergic system using gene targeting technologies.

We particularly focus on dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in an effort to delineate their specific roles in various aspects of cognitive function. We provide strong evidence, from our own recent work as well as others, that dopamine is part of the network that plays a very important role in cognitive function, and that although multiple dopamine receptor subtypes contribute to different aspects of learning and memory, the D1 receptor seems to play a more prominent role in mediating plasticity and specific aspects of cognitive function, including spatial learning and memory processes, reversal learning, extinction learning, and incentive learning.</AbstractText>"}

Besides underling many of the differences between humans and great apes, steroids hormones promote brain growth and development, are important in the myelination process, explain sexual dimorphisms in brain and intelligence and improve specific cognitive abilities in humans. Supporting our hypothesis, recent studies indicate differences in neuroactive hormones metabolism between humans and non-human primates. Furthermore, a link between X chromosome genes and sex steroids may explain why the frequency of genes affecting intelligence is so high on the X chromosome. This association suggests that, during hominid evolution, there was a positive feedback in both sexes on the same genes responsible for secondary sexual character development and intelligence. This interaction leads to acceleration of development of human brain and intelligence. Finally, we propose that neuroactive hormone therapy may provide significant improvement in some cognitive deficits in all stages of human life and in cases of neurodegenerative diseases. However, further investigation is needed, mainly in the enzymatic machinery, in order to understand the direct role of these hormones in intelligence.</AbstractText>"}

This is relevant to the loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's disease. Using a three-compartmented culture system for rat sympathetic neurons, we demonstrate that exposure of axons to Abeta1-42 activates an independent destruction program in axons, which leads to nuclear apoptosis. Abeta-induced axonal degeneration does not involve local caspase activation, but causes caspase activation in cell bodies. Accordingly, inhibition of caspase activation blocks Abeta-induced apoptosis but not axonal degeneration. In agreement with previous suggestions that disruption of nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated signaling might contribute to the loss of cholinergic neurons, we found that provision of NGF to cell bodies protects sympathetic neurons from Abeta-induced apoptosis. However, our data indicate that Abeta-induced axonal degeneration follows a mechanism different than that activated by NGF withdrawal. Only Abeta-induced axonal degeneration is prevented by the calpain inhibitor calpastatin and is insensitive to the inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome system MG132. Importantly, inhibition of Abeta-induced axonal degeneration by calpastatin prevents nuclear apoptosis.</AbstractText>"}

It has been shown that the neonatal period is critical for the establishment of normal iron content in the adult brain. Moreover, it is known that aging alters the cerebral distribution of this metal. We have recently described that neonatal administration of iron severely impaired novel object recognition memory in rats. The aim of the present study was to determine whether selegiline, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor known for its neuroprotective properties, could protect rats against cognitive impairment induced by neonatal administration of iron. In the first experiment, male Wistar rats received vehicle (5% sorbitol in water) or iron (10.0 mg/kg) orally from postnatal days 12 to 14 and saline (0.9% NaCl) or selegiline (1.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 21 days, starting 24 h before the first iron dosing. In the second experiment, rats were given either vehicle or iron (10.0 mg/kg) orally from postnatal days 12 to 14 followed by saline or selegiline (1.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 21 days, starting when rats reached adulthood (50th day after birth). Iron-treated rats given selegiline in both doses showed no deficits in recognition memory. Rats receiving iron but no selegiline presented memory deficits. This is the first study reporting the reversion of iron-induced memory impairment, supporting the view that our model can be considered as a useful tool in the search for new drugs with neuroprotective and/or memory enhancing properties.</AbstractText>"}

The main forms are: episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). EA1 is due to a mutation in KCNA1, the gene encoding human Kv1.1 on chromosome 12p13, which contributes as a subunit to the formation of potassium channels in motor nerve terminals and in many central nervous system neurones. To date, there are fifteen different mutations, which affect potassium channel's properties and lead to phenotypic variability and to different responses to therapy. EA2 can result from mutations in the CACNA1A gene, encoding calcium channels on chromosome 19p13.1 and widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. To date, associated with EA2, in the CACNA1A gene thirty different mutations have been described, resulting in altered or truncated protein products and, as a consequence, in nonfunctional calcium channels. There is phenotypic variability, also inside the same family, without correlation genotype-phenotype. SCA6 is a progressive neurodegenerative disease due to mutations of the CACNA1A gene. CACNA1A is responsible for both EA2 and SCA6. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of the two diseases is different: SCA6 is associated with small expansion of a CAGn repeat, while EA2 is due to point mutations. Clinically, SCA6 is characterized by a slowly progressive development and by an inverse correlation between the number of repeats and the severity of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Since Jpk protein harbors a transmembrane domain (TM) and a putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -retention signal at the N terminus, a subcellular localization of the protein was analyzed after fusing it into the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Both N-term- (Jpk-EGFP) and C-term-fused Jpk (EGFP-Jpk) showed to be localized in the ER when analyzed under the fluorescence microscope after staining the cells with ER- and Mito-Tracker. Through deletion analysis TM turned out to be important for ER localization of Jpk. When flow cytometric analysis was performed, both cells expressing Jpk-EGFP and EGFP-Jpk led cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death. In order to see whether Jpk is expressed during ER stress-mediated apoptosis, F9 cells were treated with DTT, an ER stress inducer. In the presence of 4 mM of DTT, about 50% of cells died strongly expressing Jpk (sevenfold) as well as Grp78, a molecular chaperone, and CHOP-10, a well-known apoptotic protein. When cells were transfected with both pEGFP-Jpk and pJpk-EGFP, cell cycle progression was interrupted compared to those of control cells. In summary, excess ER stress upregulated the expression of Jpk, which seemed to inhibit the cell cycle progression. These results altogether suggest that Jpk could be a useful cell death-triggering molecule applicable for cancer therapy as well as a useful target molecule for the treatment of certain neurodegenerative diseases caused by ER stress.</AbstractText>"}

The expansion stabilizes hAtx-1, leading to its accumulation. To understand how stabilized hAtx-1 induces selective neuronal degeneration, we studied Drosophila Atx-1 (dAtx-1), which has a conserved AXH domain but lacks a polyglutamine tract. Overexpression of hAtx-1 in fruit flies produces phenotypes similar to those of dAtx-1 but different from the polyglutamine peptide alone. We show that the Drosophila and mammalian transcription factors Senseless/Gfi-1 interact with Atx-1's AXH domain. In flies, overexpression of Atx-1 inhibits sensory-organ development by decreasing Senseless protein. Similarly, overexpression of wild-type and glutamine-expanded hAtx-1 reduces Gfi-1 levels in Purkinje cells. Deletion of the AXH domain abolishes the effects of glutamine-expanded hAtx-1 on Senseless/Gfi-1. Interestingly, loss of Gfi-1 mimics SCA1 phenotypes in Purkinje cells. These results indicate that the Atx-1/Gfi-1 interaction contributes to the selective Purkinje cell degeneration in SCA1.</AbstractText>"}

The newly designed amide form of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), was assessed for its ability to protect PC12 cells against oxidative toxicity induced by glutamate. NACA was shown to protect PC12 cells from glutamate (Glu) toxicity, as evaluated by LDH and MTS assays. NACA prevented glutamate-induced intracellular GSH loss.

All of these abnormalities have been found to occur before classic AD pathology inducing neuronal degeneration and amyloid deposition during the progression of AD.

More than 90 mutations in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause a subset of familial ALS. Toxic properties have been proposed for the ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, but the nature of the toxicity has not been clearly specified. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing mutant SOD1 and a number of other proteins are a pathological hallmark of mutant SOD1-mediated familial ALS, but whether such aggregates are toxic to motor neurons remains unclear. In this study, we identified a dynein subunit as a component of the mutant SOD1-containing high molecular weight complexes using proteomic techniques. We further demonstrated interaction and colocalization between dynein and mutant SOD1, but not normal SOD1, in cultured cells and also in G93A and G85R transgenic rodent tissues. Moreover, the interaction occurred early, prior to the onset of symptoms in the ALS animal models and increased over the disease progression. Motor neurons with long axons are particularly susceptible to defects in axonal transport. Our results demonstrate a direct 'gain-of-interaction' between mutant SOD1 and dynein, which may provide insights into the mechanism by which mutant SOD1 could contribute to a defect in retrograde axonal transport or other dynein functions.

The development of genetically altered mice lacking specific enzymes of the AA cascade has helped to elucidate the individual roles of these enzymes in brain physiology and pathology. The roles of AA and its metabolites in brain physiology, with a particular emphasis on the phospholipase A(2)/cyclooxygenases pathway, are summarized, and the specific phenotypes of genetically altered mice relevant to brain physiology and neurotoxic models are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

We showed that crossing a mouse mutant with a motoneuron disease (pmn for progressive motor neuronopathy) with mice that express the Wlds gene delayed axonal loss, increased the life span, partially rescued axonal transport deficit and prolonged the survival of the motoneuron cell bodies. To determine factors involved in the neuroprotective effect of Wlds, we combined laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis to identify genes that are differentially regulated at a pre-symptomatic age in motoneuron cell bodies in pmn/pmn,Wlds/Wlds mice as compared with pmn/pmn mice. Only 56 genes were de-regulated; none of the 'classical' genes implicated in apoptosis were de-regulated. Interestingly, a large proportion of these genes are related to axonal function and to retrograde and anterograde transport (i.e. members of the dynactin complex and kinesin family). These results were confirmed by real-time PCR, in situ hybridization and at protein level in sciatic nerves. Thus, genes related to axonal function and in particular to axonal transport may be involved at an early stage in the neuroprotective property of the Wlds gene and confirm the importance of axonal involvement in this model of motor neuron disease.</AbstractText>"}

Correlations of AD patients' performance with measures of executive functioning suggested a deficit in the cognitive resources necessary for engaging rule-based categorization. The contribution of limited executive resources to categorization difficulty in AD was further demonstrated in a second experiment in which features determining category membership were of lower salience.

Advancing age constitutes a primary risk factor for disease of the central nervous system most notably neurodegenerative disorders. The hippocampus is one of the brain regions that is prominently affected by neurodegeneration and functional decline even in what is still considered 'normal aging'. Plasticity is the basis for how the brain adapts to changes over time. The discovery of adult hippocampal neurogenesis has added a whole new dimension to research on structural plasticity in the adult and aging hippocampus. In this article, we briefly summarize and discuss recent findings on the regulation of adult neurogenesis with relevance to aging. Aging is an important co-variable for many regulatory mechanisms affecting adult neurogenesis but so far, only few studies have specifically addressed this interaction. We hypothesize that adult neurogenesis contributes to a neural reserve, i.e. the maintained potential for structural plasticity that allows compensation in situations of functional losses with aging. As such we propose that adult neurogenesis might contribute to the structural correlates of successful aging.</AbstractText>"}

A new drug application (NDA) has been filed in Japan for the treatment of spinocerebellar disease (SCD) and is under review. Data suggest that taltirelin enhances dopamine neurotransmission, although this has been questioned. Taltirelin potentiates acetylcholine (ACh)-induced neuronal excitation in rat cerebral cortex neurons and inhibits high concentration AChinduced desensitization of neuronal excitation. TRH receptors have been located in several parts of the rat brain, including the pituitary, hypothalamus, and brain stem. These data provide support for the claim that taltirelin may have a potential benefit in dementia, which is consistent with limited clinical data. Taltirelin has been shown to be more potent and longer acting than TRH in increasing the amplitude of spinal reflex potentials and withdrawal flexor reflexes in spinal rats after iv administration. The compound is also active after intraduodenal administration, in contrast to TRH, indicating its potential for the treatment of spinal functional disorders. Analysts at Yamaichi had predicted that taltirelin would be launched in Japan in 1998; this was optimistic, though the new drug application is currently under review. Additionally, their prediction was of peak annual sales of less than 5 billion Yen; however taltirelin has been designated as an orphan drug in Japan.</AbstractText>"}

NMR-based structural analysis has now revealed that the Josephin domain binds Ub and has a papain-like fold that is reminiscent of that of other deubiquitinases, despite primary sequence divergence but consistent with its deubiqutinating activity. Mutation of the catalytic Cys enhances the stability of a complex between ataxin-3 and polyubiquitinated proteins.

Yeast and mouse studies demonstrate strict coupling of individual PITPs to specific cellular activities, but the invisibility of these specificities in in vitro models for PITP activity is remarkable. In our opinion, delineation of PITP functions requires the continued application of genetic approaches such as those summarized here. Future studies dedicated to enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms of action of Sec14p-like and metazoan PITPs are worthy goals for three reasons. First, it is becoming abundantly clear that PITPs act at important biological interfaces that involve lipid and protein trafficking, phospholipid biosynthesis and polarized membrane growth. Because these interfaces are critical not only to cellular functions, but also to developmental processes, the function of PITPs in development of multicellular organisms is a particularly attractive area of research that remains essentially untapped. Second, the yeast studies indicate functional linkages between Sec14p-like PITPs and members of ubiquitous but entirely uncharacterized eukaryotic proteins such as OSBP family members. Finally, the link of PITPs to disease is already clear since PITP deficiencies lie at the foundation of novel mechanisms of neurodegenerative, glucose homeostatic and gastrointestinal disorders in mammals. Given that the contribution of Sec14p-like proteins to the PITP complement of mammalian cells is completely uninvestigated, and that the mammalian genome encodes many proteins of this class, we anticipate such advances will directly and positively impact our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Logistic regression employing one individual per family and including age of onset and disease duration as covariates demonstrated a significantly increased risk of dementia for those individuals having inherited at least one epsilon4 allele (OR=3.37; P=0.002). Survival analyses also demonstrated a significantly earlier age of onset for those subjects with at least one epsilon4 allele (59.7 years) as compared with those homozygous for the more common epsilon3 allele (62.4 years; P=0.009).

The mouse cystine/glutamate exchanger has been cloned and showed to be composed of two distinct proteins, one of which being a novel protein, named xCT, of 502 amino acids and 12 putative trans-membrane domains. We have generated and purified a polyclonal antibody to mouse xCT and studied its expression in rat brain and in different cultured cells (astrocytes, fibroblasts and neurons) using Western blot and immunocytochemical techniques. Expression of xCT was also studied in rat brain and muscle at different developmental stages. Parallel experiments were carried out with antibodies to the heavy chain of 4F2 surface antigen, the non-specific subunit of the antiporter x (c) (-) . xCT antibody detected in all cell and tissue extracts a specific band of about 40 kDa. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that xCT is concentrated mainly in the microsomal-mitochondrial fraction, in accord with its structure as transmembrane protein. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a strong staining in all cells examined, included neurons. Furthermore, both xCT and the heavy chain of 4F2 surface antigen increased in the brain during development, reaching the highest expression in adulthood.

Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with NMDA antagonists induced apoptosis without GRP78 protein expression. Apoptosis accompanied both caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. We then examined whether GSK-3 is involved in thapsigargin-induced cell death by using GSK-3 inhibitors. We assayed the effects of selective GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763, alsterpaullone and 1-azakenpaullone, on thapsigargin-induced apoptosis.

There was a significant increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and conjugated dienes in homogenates, which indicate increased lipid peroxidation (LPO). Oxidative modifications of homogenate proteins were demonstrated by a loss of sulfhydryl content, accumulation of dityrosines and formation of protein conjugates with LPO-end products. Increase in protein conjugates with LPO-end products and a decrease in SH groups were observed also in mitochondria and synaptosomes, but dityrosine content was elevated only in synaptosomes.

Moreover, recent data demonstrate that immunization with amyloid-beta peptide is therapeutically effective in AD. The nature of CNS Ags that are the target of immune attack in AD is unknown.

We have recently shown that tau interacts with the SH3 domain of Fyn, an Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn on Tyr-18. Also, tyrosine-phosphorylated tau is present in the neuropathology of AD. To determine whether alterations in the tau-Fyn interaction might correlate with disease-related factors in AD and FTDP-17, we have performed real-time surface plasmon resonance studies on a panel of 21 tau constructs with Fyn SH3. We report that the interaction between Fyn SH3 and 3R-tau was 20-fold higher than that with 4R-tau. In addition, the affinity between 4R-tau and Fyn SH3 was increased 25-45-fold by phosphorylation-mimicking mutations or by FTDP-17 mutations. In vitro kinase reactions show that tau, with lower affinity SH3 interactions, exhibited a lower level of Tyr-18 phosphorylation under our reaction conditions. Lastly, we have demonstrated that tau is phosphorylated on Tyr-18 in the tau P301L mouse model for tauopathy (JNPL3). In summary, our results suggest that disease-related phosphorylation and missense mutations of tau increase association of tau with Fyn. Because these effects are mediated through the 4R component of the tau population, these results also have implications for the FTDP-17 diseases caused by increased expression of 4R-tau.

NO is synthesized by NO synthases (NOS), a family with four major types: endothelial, neuronal, inducible and mitochondrial. They can be found in almost all the tissues and they can even co-exist in the same tissue. NO is a well-known vasorelaxant agent, but it works as a neurotransmitter when produced by neurons and is also involved in defense functions when it is produced by immune and glial cells. NO is thermodynamically unstable and tends to react with other molecules, resulting in the oxidation, nitrosylation or nitration of proteins, with the concomitant effects on many cellular mechanisms. NO intracellular signaling involves the activation of guanylate cyclase but it also interacts with MAPKs, apoptosis-related proteins, and mitochondrial respiratory chain or anti-proliferative molecules. It also plays a role in post-translational modification of proteins and protein degradation by the proteasome. However, under pathophysiological conditions NO has damaging effects. In disorders involving oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke and Parkinson's disease, NO increases cell damage through the formation of highly reactive peroxynitrite. The paradox of beneficial and damaging effects of NO will be discussed in this review.</AbstractText>"}

Furthermore, many of these compounds exert anti-inflammatory actions through inhibition of oxidative stress-induced transcription factors (e.g., NF-kappaB, AP-1), cytotoxic cytokines and cyclooxygenase-2. It appears that these properties play a crucial role in the protection against the pathologies of numerous age-related or chronic diseases. This review summarizes the latest research finding in functional foods and micronutrients in the promotion of health and reduction of risk for major chronic diseases as presented in this symposium.</AbstractText>"}

However, its abnormal occurrence has been implicated in a number of disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Translocation of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria to the cytoplasm is a key step in the initiation and/or amplification of apoptosis. Here we discuss Cyt c release in apoptosis with its impact on the CNS and review our studies of Cyt c release from isolated rat brain mitochondria in response to several insults. Calcium-induced Cyt c release, as occurs in neurons during stroke and ischemia, involves rupture of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) and can be blocked by inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT). Thus, inhibitors of the mPT have shown efficacy in animal models of ischemia. In contrast, proapoptotic proteins, such as BID, BAX, and BAK, induce Cyt c release independently of the mPT without lysing the MOM. Several inhibitors of BAX-induced Cyt c release have shown promise in models of CNS apoptosis. Because of their distinct mechanisms for Cyt c release, both the mPT and proapoptotic proteins should be targeted for effective clinical intervention in CNS disorders involving apoptosis.</AbstractText>"}

The major site of production of superoxide, the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS), is considered to be the respiratory chain in the mitochondria, but the exact mechanism and the precise location of the physiologically relevant ROS generation within the respiratory chain have not been disclosed as yet. Studies performed with isolated mitochondria have located ROS generation on complex I and complex III, respectively, depending on the substrates or inhibitors used to fuel or inhibit respiration. A more 'physiological' approach is to address ROS generation of in situ mitochondria, which are present in their normal cytosolic environment. Hydrogen peroxide formation in mitochondria in situ in isolated nerve terminals is enhanced when complex I, complex III, or complex IV is inhibited. However, to induce a significant increase in ROS production, complex III and complex IV have to be inhibited by &gt;70%, which raises doubts as to the physiological importance of ROS generation by these complexes. In contrast, complex I inhibition to a small degree is sufficient to enhance ROS generation, indicating that inhibition of complex I by approximately 25-30% observed in postmortem samples of substantia nigra from patients suffering from Parkinson's disease could be important in inducing oxidative stress. Recently, it has been described that a key Krebs cycle enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH), is also able to produce ROS. ROS formation by alpha-KGDH is regulated by the NADH/NAD+ ratio, suggesting that this enzyme could substantially contribute to generation of oxidative stress due to inhibition of complex I. As alpha-KGDH is not only a generator but also a target of ROS, it is proposed that alpha-KGDH is a key factor in a vicious cycle by which oxidative stress is induced and promoted in nerve terminals.</AbstractText>"}

We demonstrate here that human tau expressed in yeast acquired pathological phosphoepitopes, assumed a pathological conformation, and formed aggregates. These processes were modulated by yeast kinases Mds1 and Pho85, orthologues of GSK-3beta and cdk5, respectively. Surprisingly, inactivation of Pho85 increased phosphorylation of tau-4R, concomitant with increased conformational change defined by antibody MC1 and a 40-fold increase in aggregation. Soluble protein tau, purified from yeast lacking PHO85, spontaneously and rapidly formed tau filaments in vitro. Further fractionation of tau by anion-exchange chromatography yielded a hyperphosphorylated monomeric subfraction, termed hP-tau/MC1, with slow electrophoretic mobility and enriched with all major epitopes, including MC1. Isolated hP-tau/MC1 vastly accelerated in vitro aggregation of wild-type tau-4R, demonstrating its functional capacity to initiate aggregation, as well as its structural stability. Combined, this novel yeast model recapitulates hyperphosphorylation, conformation, and aggregation of protein tau, provides insight in molecular changes crucial in tauopathies, offers a source for isolation of modified protein tau, and has potential for identification of modulating compounds and genes.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the cytoskeletal target of neuroprotection by estrogens in neuronal PC12 cells. We induced oxidative stress by MPP+ administration for 24 h, and 17-alpha- and 17-beta-estradiol were used as neuroprotective drugs. We measured gene expression and protein expression of each NF subunit, NFL, NFM, and NFH, by semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Our results demonstrate that NFL mRNA and protein levels are not modulated by MPP+ or estradiol isomers, whereas NFM gene expression, as well as protein expression, are strongly influenced by MPP+, 17-alpha-, and 17-beta-estradiol after a 24-h treatment. Finally, mRNA levels of the most phosphorylated subunits, NFH, are not changed by MPP+ or treatment with both estradiol isomers, whereas NFH protein expression is decreased by the same treatments. These results suggest that oxidative stress affects neuronal cytoskeleton, maybe though proteolysis and/or abnormal structural changes in NFs.

Accumulation of toxic, possibly infectious protein aggregates induces a cascade of events, such as excessive inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis and neuronal loss. A network of highly conserved molecular chaperones and of chaperone-related proteases controls the fold-quality of proteins in the cell. Most molecular chaperones can passively prevent protein aggregation by binding misfolding intermediates. Some molecular chaperones and chaperone-related proteases, such as the proteasome, can also hydrolyse ATP to forcefully convert stable harmful protein aggregates into harmless natively refoldable, or protease-degradable, polypeptides. Molecular chaperones and chaperone-related proteases thus control the delicate balance between natively folded functional proteins and aggregation-prone misfolded proteins, which may form during the lifetime and lead to cell death. Abundant data now point at the molecular chaperones and the proteases as major clearance mechanisms to remove toxic protein aggregates from cells, delaying the onset and the outcome of protein-misfolding diseases.

Although each disease is characterized by a distinct pathology specific to a subset of neuronal cells, the formation of neuronal intranuclear aggregates containing protein with an expanded polyQ is the hallmark and common feature to most polyQ disorders. The neurodegeneration is thought to be caused by a toxic gain of function that occurs at the protein level and depends on the length of the expansion: Longer repeats cause earlier age of onset and more severe symptoms. To address whether there is a structural difference between polyQ having &lt; 40 versus &gt; 40 residues, we undertook an X-ray fiber diffraction study of synthetic polyQ peptides having varying numbers of residues: Ac-Q8-NH2, D2Q15K2, K2Q28K2, and K2Q45K2. These particular lengths bracket both the range of normalcy (9-36 repeats) and the pathological (45 repeats), and therefore could be indicative of the structural changes expected in expanded polyQ domains. Contrary to expectations of different length-dependent morphologies, we accounted for all the X-ray patterns by slablike, beta-sheet structures, approximately 20 A thick in the beta-chain direction, all having similar monoclinic lattices. Moreover, the slab thickness indicates that K2Q45K2, rather than forming a water-filled nanotube, must form multiple reverse turns.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the modern literature, attention has been drawn to the co-occurrence of two other histological markers: Lewy bodies mainly composed of abnormal alpha-synuclein, and neurofibrillary tangles due to hyperphosphorilated tau aggregation. Discrepancies exist regarding the importance of these molecular changes and its relevance for the nosology of HSS. Most authors have emphasized the importance of the Lewy body-like pathology, favoring the inclusion of HSS within the alpha-synucleinopathies. We report on a case of late-onset HSS, with the typical histological findings restricted to the basal ganglia and cerebellum in which tau pathology was exceedingly more abundant than alpha-synuclein pathology. This case contributes to the increasing evidence about the heterogeneity of HSS. We favor the view that the molecular changes and the protein misfolding underlying the Lewy body and tangle formation in HSS/NBIA are secondary to the main pathological process and should not be taken as the basis for its nosological classification.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2005 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

A similarity of unfolding kinetics found for the secondary and tertiary structure of lysozyme using deep UV resonance Raman (DUVRR) and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy leads to a hypothesis that the unfolding might be a two-state transition. In this study, chemometric analysis, including abstract factor analysis (AFA), target factor analysis (TFA), evolving factor analysis (EFA), multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (ALS), and genetic algorithm, was employed to verify that only two principal components contribute to the DUVRR and fluorescence spectra of soluble fraction of lysozyme during the fibrillation process.

Therefore, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was also utilized to address the hypothesis. The protein ion charge state distribution (CSD) envelopes of the incubated lysozyme were well fitted with two principal components.

N(6)-chlorocyclopentyladenosine (CCPA, 2.5-75 nM), a selective agonist of A(1) adenosine receptors, added to the cultures 1h prior to staurosporine, induced a dose-dependent anti-apoptotic effect, which was inhibited by the A(1) receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine.

DPPD can give electron(s) to free radicals and thus scavenge them, and protect the cells from oxidative stress. The antioxidative activities of DPPD are prominent at the micromolar order, but what about its effects at much lower concentrations? We concluded that DPPD has two actions on neuronal cells, antioxidant activity and an unknown neuroprotective effect, which are effective at micromolar and nanomolar levels, respectively. In the present report, we found that DPPD inhibited cell death caused by oxidative stress at nanomolar order (1/1000 lower than concentrations needed for antioxidant activity) and that the effects were independent of antioxidant activities. DPPD inhibited the oxidative glutamate toxicity but not the tumor necrosis factor alpha-, hydrogen peroxide-, or xanthine+xanthine oxidase-induced death of HT22 cells, a mouse neuronal cell line. DPPD and phenylenediamine derivatives protected HT22 cells against oxidative glutamate toxicity at nanomolar concentrations.

Although effective symptomatic treatments exist for PD, and, to a lesser extent, for AD, there is no therapy for these disorders which will forestall their progression. With the rise of the concept of programmed cell death (PCD) came the realization that even in the absence of complete knowledge of proximate causes neuroprotection may nevertheless be possible by targeting the pathways of PCD. One set of signaling pathways that have been implicated in cell death are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The possibility of blocking these pathways and thereby providing neuroprotection has recently been put to the test in a clinical trial of a mixed lineage kinase inhibitor in the treatment of PD. Unfortunately, this trial failed to demonstrate a protective effect. Based on considerations related to the implementation of the trial, it would be premature to conclude that inhibition of MAPK signaling is a failed strategy. In spite of these negative results, the MAPK and related kinase pathways retain their importance as potential targets in PD. In relation to pathogenesis, the discovery of mutations in the mixed lineage kinase (MLK)-like kinase leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) suggests a role for these kinases in regulating the viability of dopamine neurons. In relation to treatment, the survival signaling kinase Akt has been demonstrated in vivo to mediate striking neurotrophic and antiapoptotic effects. Thus, it is likely that therapeutic targets related to these kinase signaling pathways will emerge.</AbstractText>"}

In particular, organochlorine pesticides have been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that exposure of laboratory animals to heptachlor alters the levels and function of the dopamine transporter (DAT), an integral component of dopaminergic neurotransmission and a gateway for the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP. In this study, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to heptachlor on DAT, and other key components of the dopaminergic system, including the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Female C57BL/6J mice received 0 or 3mg/kg heptachlor in peanut butter every 3 days for 2 weeks prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation until the offspring were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 21. On postnatal day 28, DAT, VMAT2, and TH levels were increased by 100, 70, and 30%, respectively, with no change in AADC levels or total dopamine levels. The ratio of DAT:VMAT2 was increased 29%. Since an increase in the DAT:VMAT2 ratio appears to predict susceptibility of brain regions to Parkinson's disease (PD) and results in increased toxicity of MPTP, these results suggest that alterations of the dopaminergic system by developmental heptachlor exposure may increase the susceptibility of dopamine neurons to toxic insult.</AbstractText>"}

Recent epidemiological data demonstrate that environmental risk factors may play a dominant role as compared to genetic factors in the etiopathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Identification of key genetic defects such as alpha-synuclein and parkin mutations in PD also underscores the important role of genetic factors in the disease. Thus, understanding the interplay between genes and environment in PD may be critical to unlocking the mysteries of this 200-year-old neurodegenerative disease. Pesticides and metals are the most common classes of environmental chemicals that promote dopaminergic degeneration. The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin has been found in human PD postmortem brain tissues, suggesting that this pesticide has potential to promote nigral cell death. Though dieldrin has been banned, humans continue to be exposed to the pesticide through contaminated dairy products and meats due to the persistent accumulation of the pesticide in the environment. This review summarizes various neurotoxic studies conducted in both cell culture and animals models following dieldrin exposure and discusses their relevance to key pathological mechanisms associated with nigral dopaminergic degeneration including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, and apoptosis.</AbstractText>"}

Dysfunction of copper metabolism leading to its excess or deficiency results in severe ailments. Two examples of illnesses related to alterations in copper metabolism are Menkes and Wilson diseases. Several proteins are involved in the maintenance of copper homeostasis, including copper transporters and metal chaperones. In the last several years, the beta-amyloid-precursor protein (beta-APP) and the prion protein (PrP(C)), which are related to the neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer and prion diseases respectively, have been associated with copper metabolism. Both proteins bind copper through copper-binding domains that also have been shown to reduce copper in vitro. Moreover, this ability to reduce copper is associated with a neuroprotective effect exerted by the copper-binding domain of both proteins against copper in vivo. In addition to a functional link between copper and beta-APP or PrP(C), evidence suggests that copper has a role in Alzheimer and prion diseases. Here, we review the evidence that supports both, the role of beta-APP and PrP(C), in copper metabolism and the putative role of copper in neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The striatal dopamine level significantly increased in the storage phase as compared with that in the micturition phase.

Homocysteine is an intermediate in the folate, vitamin B12 and B6 dependent pathways of one-carbon and sulfur amino acid metabolism. Impairments of these pathways may cause CNS dysfunction by promoting the intracellular generation of homocysteine, which is postulated to have vasotoxic and neurotoxic properties. It might also inhibit the methylation of myelin basic protein and membrane phospholipids, or disrupt biogenic amine metabolism and many other vital CNS reactions. However, it is unclear which, if any, of these putative mechanisms underlies the epidemiological associations. Genetic mouse models of hyperhomocysteinemia suggest that the primary metabolic disturbances rather than homocysteine per se may be important in determining neurological outcomes. However, severe and early developmental abnormalities in these mice limit their usefulness for understanding the relation of hyperhomocysteinemia to adult CNS disorders. Pharmacologic and dietary studies on homocysteine in rodents have reported heightened neuronal sensitivity to neurotoxic insults, neurochemical abnormalities and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Such studies are consistent with a causal relationship, but they fail to distinguish between effects that might result from a dietary imbalance and those that might be caused by homocysteine per se. Future work should be directed towards refining these models in order to distinguish between the effects of homocysteine and its determinants on neurological and behavioral outcomes that represent different CNS disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Unlike selegiline, rasagiline is not derived from amphetamine or metabolized to neurotoxic l-methamphetamine derivative, and it does not have sympathomimetic activity. Moreover, at selective MAO-B inhibitory dosage, it does not induce a 'cheese reaction.' Rasagiline is effective as monotherapy or as an adjunct to L-dopa for patients with early and late Parkinson's disease. Adverse events do not occur with greater frequency in subjects receiving rasagiline than in those on placebo. Its S-isomer, TVP1022, is more than a thousand times less potent as an MAO inhibitor. However, both drugs have neuroprotective activities in neuronal cell cultures in response to various neurotoxins, as well as in vivo (e.g., in response to global ischemia, neurotrauma, head injury, anoxia, etc.), indicating that MAO inhibition is not a prerequisite for neuroprotection. The neuroprotective activity of these drugs has been demonstrated to be associated with the propargylamine moiety, which protects mitochondrial viability and mitochondrial permeability transition pore by activating Bcl-2 and downregulating the Bax family of proteins. Rasagiline processes amyloid precursor protein (APP) into the neuroprotective-neurotrophic soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha) by protein kinase C- and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent activation of alpha-secretase, and increases nerve growth factor, glial cell- derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and proteins. Thus, rasagiline may induce neuroprotection, neuroplasticity and long-term potentiation. Rasagiline has therefore been chosen by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study its neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term studies are required to evaluate the drug's disease-modifying prospects in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2005 Prous Science.

Thiamine deficiency (TD) produces a cascade of events including mild impairment of oxidative metabolism, activation of microglia, astrocytes and endothelial cells that leads to neuronal loss in select brain regions. The earliest changes occur in a small, well-defined brain region, the submedial thalamic nucleus (SmTN). In the present study, a micropunch technique was used to evaluate quantitatively the selective regional changes in mRNA and protein levels. To test whether this method can distinguish between changes in vulnerable and non-vulnerable regions, markers for neuronal loss (NeuN) and endothelial cells (eNOS) and inflammation (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in SmTN and cortex of control and TD mice were assessed. TD significantly reduced NeuN and increased CD11b, GFAP and ICAM-1 immunoreactivity in SmTN as revealed by immunocytochemistry. When assessed on samples obtained by the micropunch method, NeuN protein declined (-49%), while increased mRNA levels were observed for eNOS (3.7-fold), IL-1beta (43-fold), IL-6 (44-fold) and TNF-alpha (64-fold) in SmTN with TD. The only TD-induced change that occurred in cortex with TD was an increase in TNF-alpha (22-fold) mRNA levels. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha protein levels increased in TD brains and colocalized with glial markers. The consistency of these quantitative results with immunocytochemical measurements validates the micropunch technique. The results demonstrate that TD induces quantitative, distinct inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in vulnerable and non-vulnerable regions that may underlie selective vulnerability.</AbstractText>"}

Yet, ironically, they are also major mediators of cell death, either by necrosis or apoptosis. One means by which these adverse effects occur is through the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) whereby the inner mitochondrial membrane suddenly becomes excessively permeable to ions and other solutes, resulting in a collapse of the inner membrane potential, ultimately leading to energy failure and cell necrosis. The mPT may also bring about the release of various factors known to cause apoptotic cell death. The principal factors leading to the mPT are elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+ and oxidative stress. Characteristically, the mPT is inhibited by cyclosporin A. This article will briefly discuss the concept of the mPT, its molecular composition, its inducers and regulators, agents that influence its activity and describe the consequences of its induction.

Astrocyte elevated gene (AEG)-1 was cloned as an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-inducible and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-inducible transcript in primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFA) by a rapid subtraction hybridization approach. AEG-1 down-regulates the expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2; thus, it is implicated in glutamate-induced excitotoxic damage to neurons as evident in HIV-associated neurodegeneration. Interestingly, AEG-1 expression is elevated in subsets of breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme and melanoma cells, and AEG-1 cooperates with Ha-ras to augment the transformed phenotype of normal immortal cells. Moreover, AEG-1 is overexpressed in &gt;95% of human malignant glioma samples when compared with normal human brain. Overexpression of AEG-1 increases and siRNA inhibition of AEG-1 decreases migration and invasion of human glioma cells, respectively. AEG-1 contains a lung-homing domain facilitating breast tumor metastasis to lungs. These findings indicate that AEG-1 might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis, progression and metastasis of diverse cancers. Our recent observations indicate that AEG-1 exerts its effects by activating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway and AEG-1 is a downstream target of Ha-ras and plays an important role in Ha-ras-mediated tumorigenesis. These provocative findings are intensifying interest in AEG-1 as a crucial regulator of tumor progression and metastasis and as a potential mediator of neurodegeneration.

SIRT1 induction, either by sirtuin activators such as resveratrol, or metabolic conditioning associated with caloric restriction (CR), could be neuroprotective in several ways. It could promote the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, enhance clearance of amyloid beta-peptides, and reduced neuronal damage through potential inhibition of neuroinflammatory signaling pathways.

Our previously established, reflux-free convection-enhanced delivery (CED) technique and real-time imaging MR method for monitoring CED delivery of liposomes in primate CNS allowed us to closely monitor infusions of putamen.

The scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)) is an isoform of PrP(C), and it is responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of neurodegenerative diseases affecting both humans and animals. The presence of the cellular form is necessary for the establishment and further evolution of prion diseases. Here, we map the regional distribution of PrP(C) in the rat brain and study the chemical nature of these immunopositive neurons. Our observations are congruent with retrograde transport of prions, as shown by the ubiquitous distribution of PrP(C) throughout the rat brain, but especially in the damaged areas that send projections to primarily affected nuclei in fatal familial insomnia. On the other hand, the presence of the cellular isoform in a subset of GABAergic neurons containing calcium-binding proteins suggests that PrP(C) plays a role in the metabolism of calcium. The lack of immunostaining in neurons ensheathed by perineuronal nets indicates that prions do not directly interact with components of these nets. The destruction of these nets is more likely to be the consequence of a factor needed for prions during the early stages of TSEs. This would cause destruction of these nets and death of the surrounded neurons. Our results support the view that destruction of this extracellular matrix is caused by the pathogenic effect of prions and not a primary event in TSEs.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we have demonstrated that the normal human brain subependymal layer contains three morphologically distinct types of cells, A, B and C type cells. The type A cells resembling migrating neuroblasts were located in the superficial part of the subependymal layer, type B cells resembling glial cells were evenly distributed throughout the subependymal layer and caudate nucleus, and type C cells that resembled progenitor cells were located in the deeper regions of the subependymal layer close to the caudate nucleus. We also examined the subependymal layer in the Huntington's disease brain to determine whether neurodegenerative pathology of the caudate nucleus (adjacent to the subependymal layer) altered the cellular composition of the subependymal layer. In the Huntington's disease subependymal layer there was a significant increase in the thickness of the subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer (p &lt; 0.01) and there was a 2.8-fold increase in the number of cells present in the Huntington's disease subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer but the density of cells remained unchanged. As the grade of Huntington's disease increased, so did the overall number of cells in the subependymal layer. An increase in the number of type B cells was responsible for most of the increase demonstrated, however there was also an increase in the numbers of type A and C cells. To further characterise the human normal and Huntington's disease subependymal layer we used immunohistochemistry and antibodies against a range of projection neuron markers, interneuron markers, glial cell markers and GABAA receptor subunits. The results demonstrated the presence of increased numbers of neuropeptide Y positive cells in the Huntington's disease subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer, suggesting that neuropeptide Y neurons may play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. Also there was an increased level of the developmentally active GABAA receptor subunit gamma 2 that indicates that the adult subependymal layer still retains the ability to proliferate.

Even though the genetic basis of SMA is well understood, it is not clear how defects in these ubiquitous processes result in motor neuron degeneration leaving other tissues unaffected. Recent evidence from animal and cell culture models of SMA points to roles for SMN in neurite outgrowth and axonal transport.

These studies have consistently shown the presence of diffuse normal-appearing WM damage, marked gray matter involvement and significant cortical functional reorganization, as well as the occurrence of the neurodegenerative component of MS from the earliest clinical stages of the disease with only a partial relation to MRI markers of inflammatory demyelination. The present review argues that MS can no longer be viewed as a 'two-stage' disease, which suggests that the two pathological components are dissociated in time, but rather as a 'simultaneous two-component' disease, where the relative contributions of the various pathological processes of the disease to the development of 'fixed' disability, their relationship and their evolution over time need to be clarified. This new view of MS should inform the development of future research protocols to define its actual physiopathology and prompt the institution of early treatment which should ideally target not only inflammatory demyelination, but also the neurodegenerative aspects of the disease, as well as promote neuroprotection and enhance reparative mechanisms and adaptive functional reorganization of the cortex.</AbstractText>"}

To induce granule cell loss in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, Abeta (1-40) was continuously infused (300 pmol/day) into the cerebral ventricle using a mini-osmotic pump for 5 weeks. Three weeks after the Abeta infusion, the rats were tested in a place learning task, which required them to alternatively visit two diametrically opposed areas in an open field to obtain intracranial self-stimulation reward. The results indicated that the Abeta-infused rats without treatment of T-817MA displayed learning impairment in the task; their performance level was significantly inferior to that of the vehicle rats. Treatment of T-817MA (8.4 mg/kg/day, p.o.) significantly improved the task performance of the Abeta-infused rats.

This study showed that preliminary AH significantly restricted brain function impairment induced by Abeta in WR, so AH demonstrated the protective effect in WR. In contrast, in AR preliminary AH provoked those impairments induced by Abeta. The AH protective effect in WR was associated with activation of stress-limiting systems (antioxidant system, NO system).

Previously thought to be the cause of cellular toxicity such as cellular dysfunction and cell death, protein aggregation is now proposed to serve a protective role by sequestering toxic oligomers from interfering with essential physiological processes. To investigate the relationship between protein aggregation and cellular toxicity, we have characterized and compared the effects of two GFP-fusion proteins that form aggregates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one with a polyasparagine repeat (GFP(N104)) and one without (GFP(C)). Although both proteins can form microscopically visible GFP-positive aggregates, only the GFP(N104)-containing aggregates exhibit morphological and biochemical characteristics that resemble the aggregates formed by mutant huntingtin in yeast cells. Formation of both the GFP(C) and GFP(N104) aggregates depends on microtubules, while only the GFP(N104) aggregate requires the chaperone Hsp104 and the prion Rnq1 and is resistant to SDS. Although no microscopically visible GFP(N104) aggregates were observed in the hsp104Delta and rnq1Delta mutant cells, SDS-insoluble aggregates can still be detected by the filter trap assay. These observations argue that the GFP(N104)-containing aggregates can exist in at least two distinct states in vivo. We also show that a nucleus-targeted GFP(N104) interferes with transcription from two SAGA-dependant promoters and results in a decrease in cell viability. Overall, the results imply that the GFP(N104) protein behaves similarly to the mutant huntingtin in yeast cells and provides a new model for investigating the interplay between protein aggregates and the associated phenotypes.</AbstractText>"}

Hence, we studied the influence of Abeta on development of human NPCs--proliferation, migration, formation of colonies of neurons, formation processes--in culture. Pre-fibrillized human Abeta1-40 blocked development of neuronal colonies. NPC development was impaired in the presence of soluble Abeta1-40 (1.75-7 microM), and NPC differentiation into large and small neurons was altered, as demonstrated by morphometry. Antioxidant vitamin E partially abolished these effects, but not the reduced formation of neuronal processes. NPCs cultured with 7 microM Abeta1-40 accumulated Abeta monomers and oligomers and contained higher levels of protein carbonyls and lipid peroxidation products HNE and MDA. We suggest that Abeta1-40 impairs development of NPCs by oxidative damage.

To date, the signalling pathways linking oxidant stress, a component of several neurodegenerative diseases, to cell death in the CNS are poorly understood. Melastatin-like transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca(2+)-permeant non-selective cation channel, which responds to increases in oxidative stress levels in the cell and is activated by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate here that Abeta and hydrogen peroxide both induce death in cultured rat striatal cells which express TRPM2 endogenously. Transfection with a splice variant that acts as a dominant negative blocker of TRPM2 function (TRPM2-S) inhibited both hydrogen peroxide- and Abeta-induced increases in intracellular-free Ca(2+) and cell death. Functional inhibition of TRPM2 activation by the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitor SB-750139, a modulator of intracellular pathways activating TRPM2, attenuated hydrogen peroxide- and Abeta-induced cell death. Furthermore, a small interfering RNA which targets TRPM2, reduced TRPM2 mRNA levels and the toxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide and Abeta. These data demonstrate that activation of TRPM2, functionally expressed in primary cultures of rat striatum, contributes to Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced striatal cell death.</AbstractText>"}

Part of this effect may be due to the action of androgens on the innate immune response. We have examined the action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone on immune activation in primary cultures of microglia, the central nervous system macrophage. Our data indicate that DHT acts as an antiinflammatory agent and depresses both nitric oxide and TNFalpha production in a dose-dependent fashion. However, testosterone treatment of microglia and peritoneal macrophages increased supernatant nitrite levels, indicative of a proinflammatory effect. Because the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype also dramatically impacts macrophage function and has been linked to neurodegenerative disease, we compared the effects of APOE genotype on androgen-mediated regulation of inflammation using targeted replacement mice expressing only the human APOE3 or human APOE4 gene. Our data show that the antiinflammatory activity of DHT is significantly reduced in APOE4 targeted replacement mice compared to APOE3 mice. The effect was not due to an APOE isoform-specific change in androgen receptor mRNA and protein expression. Rather, innate immune signaling pathways regulated by androgens are altered in the APOE4 microglia. Compared to APOE3 microglia, DHT treatment did not reduce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK or p54/p56 Janus kinase in APOE4 mice. Thus, our data suggest that DHT modulation of kinase activity is altered in microglia from mice expressing an APOE4 genotype and may impact androgen treatment therapies in individuals with an APOE4 genotype.</AbstractText>"}

Nigral dopaminergic neurons are particularly exposed to oxidative stress because a pathological accumulation of cytosolic dopamine gives rise to various toxic molecules, including free radicals and reactive quinones. These latter species can react with proteins preventing them from exerting their physiological functions. Among the possible targets of quinones, alpha-synuclein is of primary interest because of its direct involvement in dopamine metabolism. Contrary to the neurotoxic processes, neuromelanin synthesis seems to play a protective role by its ability to sequester a variety of potentially damaging substances. In this study, we carried out a kinetic and structural analysis of the early oxidation products of dopamine. Specifically, considering the potential high toxicity of aminochrome for both cells and mitochondria, we focused our attention on its rearrangement to 5,6-dihydroxyindole. After the spectroscopic characterization of the products derived from the oxidation of dopamine, the structural information obtained was used to analyze the reactivity of quinones toward alpha-synuclein. Our results suggest that indole-5,6-quinone, rather than dopamine-o-quinone or aminochrome, is the reactive species.

This mutation leads to protein aggregation and neurotoxicity. Despite its widespread expression in the brain and body, mutated huntingtin causes selective degeneration of striatal projection neurons. In the present study, we investigate the role of dopamine (DA) in this preferential vulnerability. Using primary cultures of striatal neurons transiently expressing GFP-tagged-exon 1 of mutated huntingtin, we show that low doses of DA (100 microM) act synergistically with mutated huntingtin to activate the proapoptotic transcription factor c-Jun. Surprisingly, DA also increases aggregate formation of mutated huntingtin in all cellular compartments, including neurites, soma, and nuclei. DA-dependent potentiation of c-Jun activation was reversed by ascorbate, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, and SP-600125, a selective inhibitor of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. By contrast, DA effects on aggregate formation were reversed by a selective D2 receptor antagonist and reproduced by a D2 agonist. Similarly, striatal neurons from D2 knockout mice showed no effect of DA on aggregate formation. Blocking ROS production, JNK activation, or D2 receptor stimulation significantly reversed DA aggravation of mutated huntingtin-induced striatal death. The combined treatment with the ROS scavenger and D2 antagonist totally reversed DA's effects on mutated huntingtin-induced striatal death. Thus, the present results provide insights into the cellular mechanisms that govern striatal vulnerability in HD and strongly support a dual role of JNK activation and D2 receptor signaling in this process.</AbstractText>"}

We now report cleavage of the autoinhibitory domain of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) in two rodent models of increased IOP. Cleaved CaN was not detected in rat or mouse eyes with normal IOP. In in vitro systems, this constitutively active cleaved form of CaN has been reported to lead to apoptosis via dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bad. In a rat model of glaucoma, we similarly detect increased Bad dephosphorylation, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c (cyt c), and RGC death. Oral treatment of rats with increased IOP with the CaN inhibitor FK506 led to a reduction in Bad dephosphorylation and cyt c release. In accord with these biochemical results, we observed a marked increase in both RGC survival and optic nerve preservation. These data are consistent with a CaN-mediated mechanism of increased IOP toxicity. CaN cleavage was not observed at any time after optic nerve crush, suggesting that axon damage alone is insufficient to trigger cleavage. These findings implicate this mechanism of CaN activation in a chronic neurodegenerative disease. These data demonstrate that increased IOP leads to the initiation of a CaN-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in glaucoma and support neuroprotective strategies for this blinding disease.</AbstractText>"}

Since many genetic deficiencies have been reported in pathogenesis of the diseases, genetic backgrounds of donor stem cells should be concerned. In this study, effects of neurofilament light subunit (NFL) gene deficiency on proliferation and neuronal differentiation of MSCs were studied in vitro. Lower proliferation rate was observed in NFL-/- MSCs. When exposed to retinoic acid (RA), both NFL-/- and normal MSCs could express several markers of neuronal lineage, such as Nestin, MAP-2, NeuN, O4 and GFAP. However, the NFL expression at mRNA and protein levels was observed only in normal MSCs but absent in NFL-/- MSCs. Significant reductions in amount of neurofilament heavy subunit (NFH) protein and number of neuron-like cells were detected in differentiated NFL-/- MSCs. Interestingly, NFH positive protein accumulations were observed in the neuron-like cells derived from NFL-/- MSCs. These accumulations were perinuclear and morphologically similar to protein aggregations in motoneurons of the spinal cord in NFL-/- mice. The results suggest that NFL gene deficiency could retard MSCs proliferation and neuronal generation, even though the capability of neuronal lineage differentiation of MSCs may not be deterred. Moreover, the NFL-/- MSCs differentiated neuron-like cells carried on the genetic and pathologic deficiency, suggesting that the genetic quality of donor cells must not only be tested, but also modified before transplantation.

The goal of this study was to characterize changes in cellular GSH levels and its regulatory enzymes in a dopaminergic cell line (N27) following treatment with the Parkinsonian toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)). Cellular GSH levels were initially significantly decreased 12 h after treatment, but subsequently recovered to values greater than controls by 24 h. However, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels were increased 24 h following treatment, concomitant with a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio prior to cell death. In accordance with these changes, ROS levels were also increased, confirming the presence of oxidative stress. Decreased enzymatic activities of glutathione reductase and glutamate-cysteine ligase by 20-25% were observed at early time points and partly account for changes in GSH levels after MPP(+) exposure. Additionally, glutathione peroxidase activity was increased 24 h following treatment. MPP(+) treatment was not associated with increased efflux of glutathione to the medium.

The CAG repeat expansion is translated into an elongated polyglutamine tract in the carboxyl terminus of the alpha1A subunit. The alpha1A subunit is the main pore-forming subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel. Patients with SCA6 suffer from a severe form of progressive ataxia and cerebellar dysfunction. Design of treatments for this disorder will depend on better definition of the mechanism of disease. As a disease arising from a mutation in an ion channel gene, SCA6 may behave as an ion channelopathy, and may respond to attempts to modulate or correct ion channel function. Alternatively, as a disease in which the mutant protein contains an expanded polyglutamine tract, SCA6 may respond to the targets of drug therapies developed for Huntington's disease and other polyglutamine disorders. In this review we will compare SCA6 to other polyglutamine diseases and channelopathies, and we will highlight recent advances in our understanding of alpha1A subunits and SCA6 pathology. We also propose a mechanism for how two seemingly divergent hypotheses can be combined into a cohesive model for disease progression.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we have investigated the involvement of the lysosomal pathway in the cytotoxic mechanism of hydrogen peroxide in human neuroblastoma cells. Alteration of lysosomal and mitochondrial membrane integrity was shown to be an early event in the lethal cascade triggered by oxidative stress. Desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator that abolishes the formation of reactive oxygen species within lysosomes, prevented lysosome leakage, mitochondrial permeabilization and caspase-dependent apoptosis in hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. Inhibition of cathepsin D, not of cathepsin B, as well as small-interference RNA-mediated silencing of the cathepsin D gene prevented hydrogen peroxide-induced injury of mitochondria, caspase activation, and TUNEL-positive cell death. Cathepsin D activity was shown indispensable for translocation of Bax onto mitochondrial membrane associated with oxidative stress. DFO abolished both the cytosolic relocation of Cathepsin D and the mitochondrial relocation of Bax in hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Bax expression protected the cells from oxidoradical injury.

Studies of non-excitotoxic neurotoxic compounds and the experimental use of slice cultures in studies of HIV neurotoxicity, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurogenesis are included. For cerebral ischemia, experimental models with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and exposure to glutamate receptor agonists (excitotoxins) are reviewed. For epilepsia, focus is on induction of seizures with effects on neuronal loss, axonal sprouting and neurogenesis. For Alzheimer's disease, the review centers on the use of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in different models, while the section on repair is focused on neurogenesis and cell migration. The culturing techniques, set-up of models, and analytical tools, including markers for neurodegeneration, like the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI), are reviewed and discussed.

Despite the attempts to control blood glucose levels and blood pressure, many diabetic patients are affected by DR, which progresses to more severe forms of disease, where laser photocoagulation therapy is needed.

Genetic studies, together with the demonstration of Abeta neurotoxicity, led to the development of the amyloid cascade hypothesis to explain the AD-associated neurodegenerative process. However, a modified version of this hypothesis has emerged, the Abeta cascade hypothesis, which takes into account the fact that soluble oligomeric forms and protofibrils of Abeta and its intraneuronal accumulation also play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent evidence posit that synaptic dysfunction triggered by non fibrillar Abeta species is an early event involved in memory decline in AD. The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for impaired synaptic function and cognitive deficits is outlined in this review, focusing on oxidative stress and disturbed metal ion homeostasis, Ca(2+) dysregulation, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, cholesterol dyshomeostasis and impaired neurotransmission.

Accordingly, pharmacological strategies to inhibit caspase 12 activity have received remarkable attention in anticipation of effecting disease amelioration. Our investigation in animal models of PMD demonstrates that caspase 12 is activated following accumulation of mutant proteins in oligodendrocytes; however, eliminating caspase 12 activity does not alter pathophysiology with respect to levels of apoptosis, oligodendrocyte function, disease severity or life span.

We investigated the effect of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil administered subcutaneously in a rat model of partial unilateral cortical devascularization that induces a loss of the cortical cholinergic terminal network and a retrograde degeneration of the cholinergic projections that originate in the nucleus basalis. For 6 weeks, lesioned and sham-operated rats received a subcutaneous infusion of donepezil (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle, delivered by osmotic minipumps implanted 2 weeks before the cortical devascularization. In lesioned rats, donepezil treatment increased the number and the size of vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunoreactive boutons in comparison to vehicle treatment. Donepezil had no observable effect on any of these parameters in sham-operated animals. These results show that donepezil mitigates cholinergic neuronal degeneration in vivo.

CNS and neurological disorders","Date":"Aug 2005","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most abundant and widely distributed neuropeptides in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). An overview of the distribution of the G-protein coupled NPY receptor family (Y(1), Y(2), Y(4), Y(5) receptors) in the brain is described. The coexistence of NPY with other neurotransmitters and its wide distribution in several brain areas predict the high importance of NPY as a neuromodulator. Thus, the effect of NPY on the release of several neurotransmitters such as glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, somastotatin (SOM), serotonin (5-HT), nitric oxide (NO), growth hormone (GH) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is reviewed. A neuroprotective role for NPY under physiological conditions and during hyperactivity such as epileptic-seizures has been suggested. We have shown previously that NPY inhibits glutamate release evoked from hippocampal nerve terminals and has a neuroprotective effect in rat organotypic hippocampal cultures exposed to an excitotoxic insult. Moreover, changes in NPY levels have been observed in different pathological conditions such as brain ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). Taken together, these studies suggest that NPY and NPY receptors may represent pharmacological targets in different pathophysiological conditions in the CNS.</AbstractText>"}

It is also a feature of many neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy, trauma and several neurodegenerative diseases, commonly associated with the phenomenon of excitotoxicity. Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling gaseous molecule formed in the brain as a part of the normal intracellular calcium signalling, playing highly diversified roles in cellular physiology. For the past 20 years, numerous studies have demonstrated that NO can acts as a neurotoxin in several disorders of the nervous system. More recent evidence shows that NO can also act as a neuroprotective agent. Calcium-dependent proteases, like calpains, were also shown to be activated in several conditions of the nervous system that involve excitotoxic neurodegeneration, and have been receiving increasing attention as therapeutical targets in recent years. In this review, we bring together the recent literature concerning the involvement of NO and calpains in neuronal survival and death. The biological pathways involved with NO and calpains may be good drug targets to alter neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Inflammation and allergy","Date":"Jun 2005","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Chemokines are small secreted proteins that chemoattract and activate immune and non-immune cells both in vivo and in vitro. Besides their well-established role in the immune system, several recent reports have suggested that chemokines and their receptors may also play a role in the central nervous system (CNS). The best-known central action is their ability to act as immuno-inflammatory mediators. Indeed, these proteins regulate the leukocyte infiltration in the brain during inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, recent studies clearly demonstrate that chemokines and their receptors are constitutively expressed by glial and neuronal cells in the CNS, where they are involved in intercellular communication. The goal of this review is to summarize recent information concerning the role of chemokines in brain functions. The first part will focus on the expression of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS with the main spotlight on the neuronal expression. In the second part, we will discuss the role of chemokines and their receptors in normal brain physiology. Because several chemokines are involved in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, the role of chemokines and their receptors in these diseases is reviewed further in this section. In conclusion, the implication of chemokines in cellular communication could allow: i) to identify a new pathway for neuron-neuron and/or glia-glia and/or neuron-glia communications that are relevant to both normal brain function and neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases; ii) to develop new therapeutic approaches for still untreatable diseases further.</AbstractText>"}

Before these techniques can be used as effective treatments in the brain, efficient methods of in vivo delivery must be devised. This review first describes the mechanism of RNAi, and then critically examines both viral and non-viral methods for delivery of RNAi to the mammalian brain.

All enzymes and peptides necessary for the biosynthesis of these angiotensins have been recognized within the central nervous system. Since there are considerable mismatches concerning the localization of the different enzymes, this system is not fully understood. Moreover, since alternative pathways of the angiotensin biosynthesis exists, localization and generation, especially of the short forms of biologically active angiotensins, are largely enigmatic. The brain renin-angiotensin system mediates several classic physiological effects including body water balance, maintenance of blood pressure, sexual behaviors, and regulation of pituitary gland hormones. Beside these classic functions, the brain renin-angiotensin system has more subtle functions involving complex mechanisms such as learning and memory. The mechanisms of action seem to differ depending on the utilized different bioactive angiotensin fragments, which are formed by the action of a variety of enzymes. This phenomenon appears to represent an important mechanism for neuromodulation.

Although self-renewal and differentiation in NSCs are regulated by many genes, such as Notch and Numb, little is known about the role of defective genes on the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs from developing brain. The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation of the NPC1 gene that affects the function of the NPC1 protein. The ability of NSC self-renewal and differentiation was investigated using a model of NPC1 disease. The NPC1 disorder significantly affected the self-renewal ability of NSCs, as well as the differentiation. NSCs from NPC1-/- mice showed impaired self-renewal ability compared with the NPC1+/+ mice. These alterations were accompanied by the enhanced activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Further, the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 improved the self-renewal ability of NSCs from NPC-/- mice. This indicated that the NPC1 deficiency can lead to lack of self-renewal and altered differentiation of NSCs mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK, impairing the generation of neurospheres from NPC1-/- Thus, the NPC1 gene may play a crucial role in NSC self-renewal associated with p38 MAPK.</AbstractText>"}

In contrast, monoclonal antibodies raised to human alpha-PrP were more efficient in immunoprecipitating PrPC than PrPSc, and some of them could also distinguish between different PrP glycoforms. Using these monoclonal antibodies, the physical association of PrP glycoforms was studied in normal brain and in the brains of humans and mice with prion disease. It was shown that while PrPC glycoforms can be selectively immunoprecipitated, the differentially glycosylated molecules of native PrPSc are closely associated and always immunoprecipitate together. Furthermore, the ratio of glycoforms comprising immunoprecipitated native PrPSc from diverse prion strains was similar to those observed on denaturing Western blots.

Recent progress in understanding the molecular changes offer the possibility of specifically targeting molecules and pathways to achieve more effective and rational therapies. Drugs that target molecules involved in apoptosis are used as treatment against several diseases. Candidates such as TNF death receptor family, caspase inhibitors, antagonists of the p53-MDM2 interaction, NF-kappaB and PI3K pathways and Bcl-2 family members have been targeted as cancer cell killing agents. Moreover, apoptosis of tumor cells can also be achieved by targeting the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs, in addition to the classical antiproliferative approach. Disruption of STAT activation and interferon beta therapy have been used as a treatment to prevent the progression of some autoimmune diseases.

In the present study we measured the level of KYNA and the activities of the biosynthetic enzyme isoforms KAT I and KAT II in the plasma and in the erythrocytes (RBC) of 19 PD patients and 17 age-matched controls. The KAT I and KAT II activities were significantly lower in the plasma of PD patients, followed by a tendency to a decrease in plasma KYNA. An elevated KYNA level correlated with a significant increase in KAT II activity in the RBC of PD patients.

Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a neuroinhibitory tryptophan metabolite, has neuroprotective properties and may serve as an endogenous anti-excitotoxic agent. This hypothesis was tested in the striatum, using mice with a targeted deletion of kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), a major biosynthetic enzyme of KYNA in the mammalian brain. On post-natal day (PND) 14, the striatum of mkat-2-/- mice showed a reduction in KYNA levels but contained normal concentrations of the metabolically related neurotoxins 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid (QUIN). Intrastriatal injections of QUIN, a NMDA receptor agonist, caused significantly larger lesions in these immature mutant mice than in age-matched wild-type animals. This lesion enlargement was not observed when mkat-2-/- mice were acutely pre-treated with the kynurenine 3-hydroxylase inhibitor UPF 648, which counteracted the striatal KYNA deficit. Moreover, no increased vulnerability to QUIN was observed in 2-month-old mkat-2-/- mice, which present with normal brain KYNA levels. Intrastriatal injections of the non-NMDA receptor agonist kainate caused similar lesion sizes in both genotypes regardless of age. These results indicate that endogenous KYNA preferentially controls the vulnerability of striatal neurons to QUIN. Our data suggest that timely pharmacological interventions resulting in an up-regulation of brain KYNA levels may benefit patients suffering from HD or other neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

A decade ago, we showed that the most important mechanism by which cholesterol is eliminated from the mammalian brain involves a hydroxylation into cerebrosterol followed by diffusion of this steroid over the blood-brain barrier. Using an (18)O(2) inhalation technique, we showed that about two-thirds of the cholesterol synthesis in rat brain is balanced by conversion into cerebrosterol. The hydroxylase responsible for the reaction was found to be dependent upon NADPH and oxygen, consistent with involvement of a species of cytochrome, P-450. The gene coding for the cytochrome P-450 responsible for the reaction was later cloned by the group of David Russell in Dallas and the enzyme was found to be located to neuronal cells in the brain. Recent studies by us and others on this new pathway for elimination of cholesterol from the brain have given new insights into the mechanisms by which cholesterol homeostasis is maintained in this organ. In addition, these studies have resulted in new diagnostic and prognostic tools in connection with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

Advances in neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques have increased our knowledge of task-related changes in cortical representation areas in the intact and injured human brain. The recognition that neuronal progenitor cells proliferate and differentiate in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus in the adult mammalian brain has raised the hope that regeneration may be possible after brain lesions. Regeneration will require that new cells differentiate, survive, and integrate into existing neural networks and that axons regenerate. To what extent this will be possible is difficult to predict. Current research explores the possibilities to modify endogenous neurogenesis and facilitate axonal regeneration using myelin inhibitory factors. After apoptotic damage in mice new cortical neurons can form long-distance connections. Progenitor cells from the subventricular zone migrate to cortical and subcortical regions after ischemic brain lesions, apparently directed by signals from the damaged region. Postmortem studies on human brains suggest that neurogenesis may be altered in degenerative diseases. Functional and anatomic data indicate that myelin inhibitory factors, cell implantation, and modification of extracellular matrix may be beneficial after spinal cord lesions. Neurophysiologic data demonstrating that new connections are functioning are needed to prove regeneration. Even if not achieving the goal, methods aimed at regeneration can be beneficial by enhancing plasticity in intact brain regions.</AbstractText>"}

This scFv can have potential therapeutic value in controlling misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in vivo when expressed intracellularly in dopaminergic neurons as an intrabody.</AbstractText>"}

The underlying biochemical mechanisms of how these mutations ablate activity are poorly understood. Therefore, we developed and tested a three-dimensional homology model of aspartoacylase based on zinc dependent carboxypeptidase A. Mutations of the putative zinc-binding residues (H21G, E24D/G, and H116G), the general proton donor (E178A), and mutants designed to switch the order of the zinc-binding residues (H21E/E24H and E24H/H116E) yielded wild-type aspartoacylase protein levels and undetectable ASPA activity. Mutations that affect substrate carboxyl binding (R71N) and transition state stabilization (R63N) also yielded wild-type aspartoacylase protein levels and undetectable aspartoacylase activity. Alanine substitutions of Cys124 and Cys152, residues indicated by homology modeling to be in close proximity and in the proper orientation for disulfide bonding, yielded reduced ASPA protein and activity levels. Finally, expression of several previously tested (E24G, D68A, C152W, E214X, D249V, E285A, and A305E) and untested (H21P, A57T, I143T, P183H, M195R, K213E/G274R, G274R, and F295S) Canavan Disease mutations resulted in undetectable enzyme activity, and only E285A and P183H showed wild-type aspartoacylase protein levels. These results show that aspartoacylase is a member of the caboxypeptidase A family and offer novel explanations for most loss-of-function aspartoacylase mutations associated with Canavan Disease.</AbstractText>"}

Models should also be cost-effective and, from a biological point of view, sufficiently simple to enable molecules that act specifically (ie, that modulate a single, pre-defined target) to be identified easily and to allow for HTS. To meet these demands, typical drug discovery approaches rely heavily on biochemical assays in which the activity of a pre-defined target is reconstituted artificially. However, such a rational reductionist approach may compromise the predictability of a model because targets are assessed in an artificial environment that is deprived of any relevant biological context.

Among the hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent a unique class; they are generated in the olfactory placode and, during embryonic life, migrate to the septo/hypothalamic region along terminal and vomeronasal nerves. At this level GnRH neurons undergo terminal differentiation and start to release GnRH to modulate the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins. All these steps are under the strict control of several developmental cues and their defect might represent a cause of clinical disorders. A number of factors have been proposed to be involved in the migration of GnRH neurons, but their role is still unclear. By using gene knockout techniques it has been found that mice carrying a targeted deletion of Ebf2 gene, a component of Olf/Ebf bHLH transcription factors, show a defective migration of GnRH neurons, providing the first evidence of a mouse model of such defect. Since the investigation of GnRH neurons is hindered by their peculiar anatomical distribution, other studies has been forwarded by the availability of immortalized GnRH-expressing neurons (GN11 cells) that retain a strong chemomigratory response 'in vitro'. Among the factors analysed, we found that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induce specific chemotaxis of GN 11 neurons, suggesting that migratory signals can arise from nasal mesenchyme and from the concomitant vasculogenesis. Finally, anosmin-1 (the product of the gene responsible of the X-linked form of Kallmann's disease) was found to induce a significant chemotactic response of GN11 cells, confirming a permissive/instructive role of KAL1 gene product in the migratory behaviour of GnRH neurons. In conclusion, the migration of the GnRH neurons appears to be a complex process, which involves the interplay of multiple molecular cues. These studies may provide new insights on the etiopathogenesis of the large proportion of reproductive dysfunctions that affect humans and could provide novel insights on common biochemical events controlling neuronal development and migration.</AbstractText>"}

Whereas prion diseases in animals appear to be almost exclusively transmitted by infection, human prion diseases most often occur sporadically and, to a lesser extent, by inheritance or infection. In the sporadic cases (sporadic Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, sCJD), PrP-containing plaques are infrequent, whereas in transmitted (variant CJD) and inherited (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome) cases, plaques are a usual feature. In the current study, representative cases from each of the classes of human prion disease were analyzed for the presence of markers of oxidative damage that have been found in other neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, we found that the pattern of deposition of PrP, amyloid-beta, and redox active metals was distinct for the various prion diseases. Whereas 8-hydroxyguanosine has been shown to be increased in sCJD, and inducible NOS is increased in scrapie-infected mice, well-studied markers of oxidative damage that accumulate in the lesions of other neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Parkinson's disease), such as heme oxygenase-1 and lipid peroxidation, were not found around PrP deposits or in vulnerable neurons. These findings suggest an important distinction in prion-related oxidative stress, indicating that different neurodegenerative pathways are involved in different prion diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The cause is unknown but over the past few years tremendous progress in our understanding of the genetic bases of this condition has been made. To date, this has almost exclusively come from the study of relatively rare Mendelian forms of the disease and there are no currently, widely accepted common variants known to increase susceptibility. The role that the 'Mendelian' genes play in common sporadic forms of PD is unknown. Moreover, most studies in PD can really be described as candidate polymorphism studies rather than true and complete assessments of the genes themselves. We provide a model of how one might tackle some of these issues using Parkinson's disease as an illustration. One of the emerging hypotheses of gene environment interaction in Parkinson's disease is based on drug metabolizing (or xenobiotic) enzymes and their interaction with putative environmental toxins. This motivated us to describe a tagging approach for an extensive but not exhaustive list of 55 drug metabolizing enzyme genes. We use these data to illustrate the power, and some of the limitations of a haplotype tagging approach. We show that haplotype tagging is extremely efficient and works well with only a modest increase in effort through different populations. The tagging approach works much less well if the minor allele frequency is below 5%. However, it will now be possible using these tags to evaluate these genes comprehensively in PD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Notwithstanding a significant weight reduction in the 200 mg HCY group, HCY-exposed animals did not show a behavioural deficit when tested repeatedly (in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 13) in a reference memory version of the water maze. Unexpectedly, some improvement in repeated reversal learning was observed in HCY exposed animals compared to controls. Pre-treatment with HCY for 3 weeks before water maze training did not uncover any cognitive alterations. Increased plasma concentrations of HCY were revealed only for the 200 mg HCY group after 14 weeks of injections, but no evidence for DNA damage was obtained. Immunocytochemically, HCY was detected in the brain after 14 weeks of treatment (both 20 and 200 mg/kg), but not after 5 weeks. Bidirectional changes in basic synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were observed at 5, 7 and 14 weeks in both HCY groups, indicative of complex, multifactorial time- and concentration-dependent changes.

Copper binding to amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is linked with the neurotoxicity of Abeta and free radical damage. Metallothionein-3 (MT-3) is a small cysteine- and metal-rich protein expressed in the brain and found down-regulated in AD. This protein occurs intra- and extracellularly, and it plays an important role in the metabolism of zinc and copper. In cell cultures Zn7MT-3, by an unknown mechanism, protects neurons from the toxicity of Abeta. We have, therefore, used a range of complementary spectroscopic and biochemical methods to characterize the interaction of Zn7MT-3 with free Cu2+ ions. We show that Zn7MT-3 scavenges free Cu2+ ions through their reduction to Cu+ and binding to the protein. In this reaction thiolate ligands are oxidized to disulfides concomitant with Zn2+ release. The binding of the first four Cu2+ is cooperative forming a Cu(I)4-thiolate cluster in the N-terminal domain of Cu4,Zn4MT-3 together with two disulfides bonds. The Cu4-thiolate cluster exhibits an unusual stability toward air oxygen. The results of UV-visible, CD, and Cu(I) phosphorescence at 77 K suggest the existence of metal-metal interactions in this cluster. We have demonstrated that Zn7MT-3 in the presence of ascorbate completely quenches the copper-catalyzed hydroxyl radical (OH.) production. Thus, zinc-thiolate clusters in Zn7MT-3 can efficiently silence the redox-active free Cu2+ ions. The biological implication of our studies as to the protective role of Zn7MT-3 from the Cu2+ toxicity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of CryAB(R120G) develop cardiomyopathy at 3 months and die at 6-7 months from heart failure (HF). Previous studies showed that overexpression of CryAB(R120G) results in accumulation of preamyloid oligomer (PAO). PAO is considered to be the cytotoxic entity in many of the protein misfolding-based neurodegenerative diseases. On the basis of data from mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases showing that exercise or environmental enrichment reduces the amyloid oligomer level and improves cognitive ability, we hypothesized that CryAB(R120G)-induced DRM would also respond favorably to prolonged voluntary exercise, reducing HF symptoms and rescuing the mice from premature death. Six months of voluntary exercise in CryAB(R120G) animals resulted in 100% survival at a time when all unexercised mice had died. After 22 weeks of exercise, PAO levels were decreased by 47% compared with the unexercised CryAB(R120G) control mice (P = 0.00001). Although CryAB(R120G) expression led to decreased levels of the metallomembrane endopeptidase neprilysin, normal levels were maintained in the exercised CryAB(R120G) mice, and in vitro loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using adenovirus-infected cardiomyocytes confirmed the importance of neprilysin in ameliorating PAO accumulation. The data demonstrate that voluntary exercise slows the progression to HF in the CryAB(R120G) DRM model and that PAO accumulation is mediated, at least in part, by decreased neprilysin activity.</AbstractText>"}

The normal function of PrPC is still unknown, but it exhibits properties of a cupro-protein, capable of binding up to six copper ions. There are two differing views on copper's role in prion diseases. While one view looks at the PrPC copper-binding as the trigger for conversion to PrPSc, the opposing viewpoint sees a lack of PrPC copper-binding resulting in the conformational change into the disease causing isoform. Manganese and zinc have been shown to interact with PrPC as well and have been found in abnormal levels in prion diseases. This review addresses the interaction between select trace elements and the PrPC.</AbstractText>"}

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are amongst the most common groups of neurodegenerative diseases. Infantile, juvenile, and adult-onset types with multiple genotype-phenotype associations have been described. A fluorimetric enzyme assay for palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT) from leukocytes and fibroblasts has been previously developed to confirm the diagnosis of infantile NCL. We describe a patient with juvenile-onset NCL phenotype with a new CLN1 mutation and deficient PPT activity. Over 40 different mutations have been found in patients with PPT deficiency, indicating that screening for known mutations is not an efficient way to diagnose this disorder. Therefore, PPT enzyme analysis should precede mutation analysis in suspected PPT deficiency, particularly in patients with granular osmiophilic deposits (GROD) or in patients who have negative ultrastructural data. The use of enzyme assay led to the diagnosis of this patient with juvenile-onset Finnish variant NCL with PPT deficiency, and we expect that greater awareness of the utility of the enzymatic assay may lead to identification of other similar cases awaiting a definitive diagnosis.</AbstractText>"}

Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by conformational changes in proteins that result in their misfolding and aggregation. Normal protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system can prevent accumulation of aberrantly folded proteins. Our recent studies have linked nitrosative stress to protein misfolding and neuronal cell death. In particular, molecular chaperones - such as protein disulfide isomerase, glucose regulated protein 78, and heat shock proteins - can provide neuroprotection from misfolded proteins by facilitating proper folding and thus preventing aggregation. Here, we present evidence for the hypothesis that NO contributes to normal brain aging and degenerative conditions by S-nitrosylating specific chaperones that would otherwise prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Many studies support the notion that oxidative stress plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. Previous studies from our laboratory employed redox proteomics to identify oxidatively modified proteins in the AD inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and hippocampus. The proteins were consistent with biochemical or pathological alterations in AD and have been central to further investigations of the disease. The present study focused on the identification of specific targets of protein S-glutathionylation in AD and control IPL by using a redox proteomics approach. For AD IPL, we identified deoxyhemoglobin, alpha-crystallin B, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and alpha-enolase as significantly S-glutathionylated relative to these brain proteins in control IPL. GAPDH and alpha-enolase were also shown to have reduced activity in the AD IPL. This study demonstrates that specific proteins are sensitive to S-glutathionylation, which most likely is due to their sensitivity to cysteine oxidation initiated by the increase in oxidative stress in the AD brain.</AbstractText>"}

This subfamily of metzincin peptidases can cleave extracellular matrix (ECM) and pericellular proteins that have profound effects on cell behavior. Among known MMP substrates are several proteins that play important roles in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation (LTP). In this Mini-Review we discuss how MMP-directed cleavage of these proteins can impact the formation and function of synapses within the brain. Pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, and other large neurons, are surrounded by perineuronal nets that are composed of brevican, tenascin-R, and laminin, each of which is subject to proteolytic cleavage by MMPs. Tenascin-R knockout mice show deficits in learning and memory and LTP, as do at least two MMP knockouts. Impaired LTP is also seen in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) knockout mice, which is interesting in that pro-BDNF can be processed into mature BDNF by several MMPs and thereby regulate activation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor TrkB. At the synaptic level, MMP substrates also include ephrins, Eph receptors, and cadherins, which are also involved in synapse development and plasticity. MMPs can also process membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-alpha into a potent soluble cytokine that is increasingly implicated in neuron-glial signaling, particularly in neurologic disease. Finally, we discuss how the development of therapeutics to attenuate MMP activity in neurodegenerative disorders may become powerful tools for future studies of synaptic formation and function within the developing and mature brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In addition, reversible tau phosphorylation was observed during hibernation in European ground squirrels. The present study provides data on the tau phosphorylation status in the hippocampus of euthermic Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), laboratory animals potentially prone to hibernation. Mossy fibers in the CA3 region of all investigated hamsters were immunostained using an antiserum detecting phospho-serine 199 of tau.

Yet, several independent lines of experimental evidence strongly suggested that intracellular proteolysis is largely nonlysosomal, but the mechanisms involved remained obscure. The discovery of the ubiquitin-proteasome system resolved the enigma. We now recognize that degradation of intracellular proteins is involved in regulation of a broad array of cellular processes, such as cell cycle and division, regulation of transcription factors, and assurance of the cellular quality control.

However, reports on the intracellular activity of PEP suggest additional, as yet unidentified, physiological functions for this enzyme. Here, we demonstrate using biochemical methods of subcellular fractionation, immunocytochemical double-labelling procedures and localization of PEP-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins that PEP is mainly localized to the perinuclear space, and is associated with the microtubulin cytoskeleton in human neuroblastoma and glioma cell lines. Disassembly of the microtubules by nocodazole treatment disrupts both the fibrillar tubulin and PEP labelling. Furthermore, in a two-hybrid screen, PEP was identified as binding partner of tubulin. These findings indicate novel functions for PEP in axonal transport and/or protein secretion. Indeed, a metabolic labelling approach revealed that both PEP inhibition and PEP antisense mRNA expression result in enhanced peptide/protein secretion from human U-343 glioma cells. Because disturbances in intracellular transport and protein secretion mechanisms are associated with a number of ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases, cell-permeable PEP inhibitors may be useful for the application in a variety of related clinical conditions.</AbstractText>"}

One mechanism that cells use to maintain redox homeostasis is the antioxidant response pathway. Antioxidant response elements (AREs) are cis-acting elements located in regulatory regions of antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a member of the Cap 'n' Collar family of transcription factors that binds to the ARE and regulates the transcription of specific ARE-containing genes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutamylcysteine synthetase and heme oxygenase. Activation of Nrf2 results in release from its negative repressor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and allows Nrf2 to translocate into the nucleus to induce gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that increasing Nrf2 activity by various methods, including chemical induction, Nrf2 overexpression or Keap1 siRNA knockdown, protects cells against specific types of oxidative damage. Cells were protected against 6-hydroxydopamine- and 3-morpholinosydnonimine-mediated toxicity but not against 1-methyl-1-4-phenylpyridinium toxicity. As oxidative stress is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, pharmacological agents that selectively target the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway may provide a novel neuroprotective strategy for the treatment of these diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The levodopa response was assessed after a minimum period of 1 month of continuous treatment. All patients had brain computed tomography or brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and detailed neuropsychological examinations. Of 265 patients, only 66 were classified as Parkinson's disease, whereas 58 fulfilled the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (SPSP) criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy, 100 had unclassifiable parkinsonism, characterized by dopa-unresponsiveness, marked axial rigidity, relative symmetry of parkinsonian features, early dysarthria, and frontolimbic cognitive impairment. Within this group, early postural instability, dysarthria, a frontal behavior disorder, cortical or subcortical atrophy, pyramidal signs, axial rigidity, and family history of neurodegenerative disorders were associated with poorer prognosis. A very large number of unclassifiable cases of atypical parkinsonism that do not fulfill operational criteria for Parkinson's disease or other defined motor neurodegenerations has been observed on Guadeloupe.

Elevated intraocular pressure is traditionally considered to be the most important risk factor for glaucoma, and treatment options for the disease have hitherto been limited to its reduction. However, visual field loss and RGC death continue to occur in patients with well controlled intraocular pressures and, thus, a consensus has recently emerged that additional treatment strategies are needed. One such strategy is pharmacological neuroprotection, which in the context of glaucoma, refers to the situation in which a drug is deployed to interact with neuronal or glial elements within the retina/optic nerve head and thereby facilitate the survival of RGCs. The advent of animal models of chronic glaucoma has enhanced our understanding of many of the pathological processes occurring in glaucoma and, in doing so, described logical targets for pharmacological intervention. Such targets, which have been manipulated with varying degrees of success in relevant animal paradigms include glutamate receptors, autoimmune elements, neurotrophin deprivation, nitric oxide synthesis, oxidative stress products, sodium and calcium channels, heat shock proteins and apoptotic pathways.

Using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we identified five major constituents among eight major peaks, including rosmarinic acid, carnosol, 12-methoxycarnosic acid, carnosic acid, and methyl carnosate. In the LDL model, REA was proven to be more efficient than REw; yet, the reverse is true for the collagen and the thrombin III models, the reason of which was ascribed to the higher lipid-soluble antioxidant content (such as rosmarinic acid, carnosol, carnosic acid, 12-methoxycarnosic acid and methyl carnosate) in REA than in REw and the different surface lipid characteristics between LDL and collagen; although to act as anti-AGEs, both extracts were comparable.

NHN RDCs were compared with prediction on the basis of a statistical model describing the intrinsic conformational sampling of unfolded proteins in solution. While local variation and relative amplitude of RDCs agrees with propensity-based prediction for most of the protein, homologous sequences in each repeat domain (DLKN, DLSN, DLSK, and DKFD in repeats R1-R4) show strong disagreement characterized by inversion of the sign of the central couplings. Accelerated molecular dynamic simulations (AMD) in explicit solvent revealed strong tendencies to form turns, identified as type I beta-turns for repeats R1-R3. Incorporation of the backbone dihedral sampling resulting from AMD into the statistical coil model closely reproduces experimental RDC values. These localized sequence-dependent conformational tendencies interrupt the propensity to sample more extended conformations in adjacent strands and are remarkably resistant to local environmental factors, as demonstrated by the persistence of the RDC signature even under harsh denaturing conditions (8 M urea).

A gene dosage effect is observed in some cases, and the phenotype of some of the mutation carriers closely resembles typical PD. Penetrance of some of the recurrent mutations is incomplete and may vary with age. Further research to unravel the etiopathology could identify biochemical or genetic markers for potential neuroprotective trials.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Because of the small number of randomized controlled trials, the management of MSA is largely based on empirical or open-label evidence. Parkinsonism often shows a poor or unsustained response to chronic levodopa therapy, although more patients than previously recognized may experience an initial moderate-to-good dopaminergic response. There is no effective drug treatment for cerebellar ataxia. However, features of dysautonomia such as orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention or incontinence, constipation, and impotence, may often be relieved if recognized by the treating physician. Because no drug treatment consistently benefits patients with this disease in the long-term, palliative therapies are all the more important. Novel symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies are urgently required.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism is present in 80% of MSA cases, and this dominant clinical presentation (MSA-P) is associated with a combined degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the striatum in anatomically related areas. The limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of MSA and the lack of therapeutic strategies prompted the development of lesion models reproducing striatonigral degeneration, the substrate of levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism in MSA-P. This method was carried out first in rats with two different stereotaxic strategies using either two neurotoxins ('double toxin-double lesion') or a single neurotoxin ('single toxin-double lesion'). Double-lesioned rat models showed severe motor impairment compared to those with a single nigral or striatal lesion and helped to mimic different stages of the disease. Systemic models were also developed in mice and primates using the nigral toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and the striatal toxin 3-nitropropionic (3-NP). In mice, although MPTP reduced the subsequent sensitivity to 3-NP in a sequential lesion, simultaneous nigral and striatal insults were shown to exacerbate striatal damage. MPTP-treated monkeys displayed a significant worsening of parkinsonism and a loss of levodopa-responsiveness after the appearance of hindlimb dystonia and striatal lesion formation induced by subsequent 3-NP intoxication. The different species and intoxication paradigms used will be useful to investigate functional changes in substantia nigra and striatum and to define neuroprotective, neurorestorative, or symptomatic therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

For a long time, it was unclear whether the dysfunction of tau protein follows disease or whether disease follows the dysfunction of tau protein. The identification of mutations in Tau as the cause of FTDP-17 has resolved this issue. About half of the known mutations have their primary effect at the protein level, and they reduce the ability of tau protein to interact with microtubules and increase its propensity to assemble into abnormal filaments. The other mutations have their primary effect at the RNA level, thus perturbing the normal ratio of three-repeat to four-repeat tau isoforms. Where studied, this resulted in the relative overproduction of tau protein with four microtubule-binding repeats in brain. Several Tau mutations give rise to diseases that resemble progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, or Pick's disease. Moreover, the H1 haplotype of Tau has been identified as a significant risk factor for progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Criteria have been defined that in most instances allow for adequate diagnosis of the two disorders both clinically and neuropathologically; however, overlap is not uncommon. For example, patients with PSP may present with severe unilateral apraxia and supranuclear gaze palsy can occur in CBD. Pathological overlap also occurs and pathologically 'mixed' cases are encountered. Common to both these two tauopathies is that isoforms of four-repeat tau due to splicing of exon 10 define the tau filamentous aggregates. This is in contrast to other tau disorders such as Pick's with three-repeat tau aggregates. Additional evidence for a causal link between PSP and CBD is the finding that both disorders are homozygous for the H1 tau haplotype. Furthermore, in some families with parkinsonism linked to defined mutations of the tau gene (FTDP-17), involved relatives have presented with PSP whereas others with the CBD phenotype. Although PSP and CBD frequently can be clearly separated clinically and pathologically, the degree of clinicopathological and genetic overlap is important and suggests that they represent different phenotypes of the same disorder, with differences occurring perhaps in relation to different genetic background. That PSP and CBD are distinct nosological entities occurring in patients with similar genetic predisposition cannot be ruled out.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

At postmortem examination, affected patients show numerous alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies (LB) in many parts of the cerebral cortex, particularly neocortical and limbic areas in addition to the nigral LB degeneration characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical presentation, unlike PD, is with progressive cognitive decline with particular deficits of visuospatial ability as well as frontal executive function accompanied by usually only mildly to moderately severe parkinsonism, which is often akineto-rigid without the classical parkinsonian rest-tremor. Further accompanying features include spontaneous recurrent visual hallucinations and conspicuous fluctuations in alertness and cognitive performance. The two main differential diagnoses are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). To improve the differential diagnosis of DLB, consensus criteria have been developed that establish possible and probable levels of clinical diagnostic accuracy. Generally, their sensitivity is variable and low but their specificity is high. Current consensus is to restrict a diagnosis of DLB only to patients with parkinsonism who develop dementia within 12 months of the onset of motor symptoms. Using operationalized criteria, DLB can be diagnosed clinically with an accuracy similar to that achieved for AD or PD. Ancillary investigations, particularly neuroimaging, can aid in differential diagnosis. We review the present state of the best practice in the clinical diagnosis of DLB. Future modifications of diagnostic criteria would ideally include the full range of clinical presentations that can be associated with LB disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2005 Movement Disorder Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The normal cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a membrane sialoglycoprotein of unknown function having the unique property of adopting an abnormal tertiary conformation. The pathological conformer (PrP(sc)) would be the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases. Prion propagation involves recruitment of host cellular prion protein, primarily of alpha-helical structure, into a disease-specific isoform rich in beta-sheet structure. The existence of multiple prion strains has been difficult to explain in terms of a protein-only infectious agent, but recent studies suggest that strain specific phenotypes can be encoded by different prion protein conformations and glycosylation patterns. It is an intriguing proposition that the post-translational modifications alone, or in combination with amino acid changes, play dominant roles in the pathogenic transformation of PrP(c) to PrP(sc). Prion diseases are unique in that they comprise sporadic, genetic (autosomal dominant inheritance), and iatrogenically or environmentally acquired forms.

A possible cell surface target for Abetas is the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)). By using SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells without neurotrophin receptors or engineered to express the full-length p75(NTR) or various parts of it, we have proven that p75(NTR) does mediate the Abeta-induced cell killing via its intracellular death domain (DD). This signaling via the DD activates caspase-8, which then activates caspase-3 and apoptogenesis. We also found a strong cytocidal interaction of direct p75(NTR)-mediated and indirect pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated neuronal damage induced by Abeta. In fact, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta from Abeta-activated microglia potentiated the neurotoxic action of Aalpha mediated by p75(NTR) signaling. The pro-inflammatory cytokines probably amplify neuronal damage and killing by causing astrocytes to flood their associated neurons with NO and its lethal oxidizing ONOO- derivative. Indeed, we have found that a combination of three major pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta+IFN-gamma+TNF-alpha, causes normal adult human astrocytes (NAHA) to express nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) and make dangerously large amounts of NO via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Soluble Abeta40, the major amyloid precursor protein cleavage product, by itself stimulates astrocytes to express NOS-2 and make NO, possibly by activating p75(NTR) receptors, which they share with neurons, and can considerably amplify NOS-2 expression by the pro-inflammatory cytokine trio. These observations have uncovered a deadly synergistic interaction of Abeta peptides with pro-inflammatory cytokines in the neuron-astrocyte functional units of the AD brain. Finally, we have found that p75(NTR) and its DD also mediate the killing of SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells by the prion protein fragment PrP106-126. Thus, neurons expressing p75(NTR) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors are likely the preferential targets of Abetas and prions and the neurodegenerative diseases they cause.</AbstractText>"}

It has been suggested that mutant polyQ proteins impair functions of nuclear factors by interacting with them directly in the nucleus. However, a systematic analysis of quantitative changes in soluble nuclear proteins in neurons expressing mutant polyQ proteins has not been performed. Here, we perform a proteome analysis of soluble nuclear proteins prepared from neurons expressing huntingtin (Htt) or ataxin-1 (AT1) protein, and show that mutant AT1 and Htt similarly reduce the concentration of soluble high mobility group B1/2 (HMGB1/2) proteins. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays indicate that HMGBs interact with mutant AT1 and Htt. Immunohistochemistry showed that these proteins were reduced in the nuclear region outside of inclusion bodies in affected neurons. Compensatory expression of HMGBs ameliorated polyQ-induced pathology in primary neurons and in Drosophila polyQ models. Furthermore, HMGBs repressed genotoxic stress signals induced by mutant Htt or transcriptional repression. Thus, HMGBs may be critical regulators of polyQ disease pathology and could be targets for therapy development.</AbstractText>"}

The transition of the prion protein (PrP) from a mainly alpha-structured isoform (PrPC) to a prevalent beta-sheet-containing protein (PrPSc) is believed to represent a major pathogenetic mechanism in prion diseases. To investigate the linkage between PrP neurotoxicity and its conformation, we used a recombinant prion protein fragment corresponding to the amino acidic sequence 90-231 of human prion protein (hPrP90-231). Using thermal denaturation, we set up an experimental model to induce the process of conversion from PrPC to PrPSc. We report that partial thermal denaturation converts hPrP90-231 into a beta-sheet-rich isoform, displaying a temperature- and time-dependent conversion into oligomeric structures that share some physico-chemical characteristics with brain PrPSc. SH-SY5Y cells were chosen to characterize the potential neurotoxic effect of hPrP90-231 in its different structural conformations. We demonstrated that hPrP90-231 in beta-conformation, but not when alpha-structured, powerfully affected the survival of these cells. hPrP90-231 beta-structured caused DNA fragmentation and a significant increase in caspase-3 proteolytic activity (maximal effects+170%), suggesting the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Finally, we investigated the involvement of MAP kinases in the regulation of beta-hPrP90-231-dependent apoptosis. We observed that the p38 MAP kinase blocker SB203580 prevented the apoptotic cell death evoked by hPrP90-231, and Western blot analysis revealed that the exposure of the cells to the peptide induced p38 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the hPrP90-231 elicits proapoptotic activity when in beta-sheet-rich conformation and that this effect is mediated by p38 and caspase-3 activation.</AbstractText>"}

In mitochondria from control and apoptotic cells cytochrome oxidase (COX) activity was estimated by preferential cytochemistry. Number of mitochondria (numeric density: Nv), volume fraction occupied by mitochondria/microm3 of cytoplasm (volume density: Vv), and average mitochondrial volume (V) were calculated for both COX-positive and -negative organelles. The ratio (R) of the cytochemical precipitate area to the overall area of each mitochondrion was evaluated on COX-positive organelles to estimate the inner mitochondrial membrane fraction actively involved in cellular respiration. Following apoptotic stimulus, the whole mitochondrial population showed a significant increase of Nv and Vv, while V was significantly decreased. In COX-positive organelles higher values of Nv were found, V appeared significantly reduced, and Vv was unchanged. R was increased at a nonsignificant extent in apoptotic cells. COX-positive mitochondria accounted for 21% and 35% of the whole population in control and in apoptotic cells, respectively. These findings document that in the early stages of apoptosis the increased fraction of small mitochondria provides an adequate amount of ATP for progression of the programmed cell death and these more efficient organelles appear to represent a reactive response to the loss of metabolically impaired mitochondria. A better understanding of the mitochondrial role in neuronal apoptosis may suggest potential interventions to prevent the extensive nerve cell death typical of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Recombinant human TPP-I and its mutants were analyzed in order to clarify the biochemical role of TPP-I and its mechanism of activity. Ser280, Glu77, and Asp81 were identified as the catalytic residues based on mutational analyses, inhibition studies, and sequence similarities with other family members. TPP-I hydrolyzed most effectively the peptide Ala-Arg-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu (*, cleavage site) (k(cat)/K(m) = 2.94 microM(-1).s(-1)). The k(cat)/K(m) value for this substrate was 40 times higher than that for Ala-Ala-Phe-MCA. Coupled with other data, these results strongly suggest that the substrate-binding cleft of TPP-I is composed of only six subsites (S(3)-S(3)'). TPP-I prefers bulky and hydrophobic amino acid residues at the P(1) position and Ala, Arg, or Asp at the P(2) position. Hydrophilic interactions at the S(2) subsite are necessary for TPP-I, and this feature is unique among serine-carboxyl proteinases.

We studied frataxin protein and mRNA expression and localisation during cellular differentiation. We used the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2, as it is considered a good model for intestinal epithelial differentiation and the study of intestinal iron metabolism. Here we report that the protein, but not the mRNA frataxin levels, increase during the enterocyte-like differentiation of Caco-2 cells, as well as in in-vivo-differentiated enterocytes at the upper half of the crypt-villus axis. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation and double immunostaining, followed by confocal analysis, reveal that frataxin localisation changes during Caco-2 cell differentiation.

Finally, we demonstrate a physical interaction between extramitochondrial frataxin and IscU1, a cytoplasmic isoform of the human Fe/S cluster assembly machinery. Based on our data, we postulate that frataxin could be involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulphur proteins not only within the mitochondria, but also in the extramitochondrial compartment.

Biochemical analysis of extracted amyloid and preamyloid species indicates that as the solubility of the deposits decreases, the heterogeneity and complexity of the extracted peptides exponentially increase. Nonfibrillar deposits were mainly composed of intact ADan-(1-34) and its N-terminally modified (pyroglutamate) counterpart together with Abeta-(1-42) and Abeta-(4-42) in approximately 1:1 mixture. The post-translational modification, glutamate to pyroglutamate, was not present in soluble circulating ADan. In the amyloid fractions, ADan was heavily oligomerized and highly heterogeneous at the N and C terminus, and, when intact, its N terminus was post-translationally modified (pyroglutamate), whereas Abeta was mainly Abeta-(4-42). In all cases, the presence of Abeta-(X-40) was negligible, a surprising finding in view of the prevalence of Abeta40 in vascular deposits observed in sporadic and familial AD, Down syndrome, and normal aging. Whether the presence of the two amyloid subunits is imperative for the disease phenotype or just reflects a conformational mimicry remains to be elucidated; nonetheless, a specific interaction between ADan oligomers and Abeta molecules was demonstrated in vitro by ligand blot analysis using synthetic peptides. The absence of compact plaques in the presence of extensive neuro fibrillar degeneration strongly suggests that compact plaques, fundamental lesions for the diagnosis of AD, are not essential for the mechanism of dementia.</AbstractText>"}

In our patients, the most salient aspects of cognitive impairment were: an evident alteration of rapid alternating operative strategies, associated with the evident impairment of set shifting, of executive operations, of operative and sequential procedure and of implementation of judgement and abstract reasoning. The self-activation of retrieval processes is partly preserved in CBD. As all the other types of subcortical impairments, even CBD encompasses both cognitive impairment as well as a wide range of behaviour disturbances, such as progressive alterations of sleep, depression, and of anxiety (with a remarkable incidence of somatic pain).

Apoptosis is coordinated by a family of cysteine proteinases called caspases, which dismantle the cell by targeting panoply of proteins. The mammalian caspase family contains 14 members, a subset participates in cellular demise and the remaining are involved in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Recent work has provided support for several mechanisms that may account for neurodegeneration, but no unifying mechanism has emerged. We have previously demonstrated that in SCA3, the expanded CAG tract in the MJD-1 transcript is prone to frameshifting, which may lead to the production of polyalanine-containing proteins. To further examine the occurrence of frameshifting and understand its mechanism and possible role in pathogenesis, a cellular model was established. We show that this phenomenon results from ribosomal slippage to the -1 frame exclusively, that ribosomal frameshifting depends on the presence of long CAG tracts and that polyalanine-frameshifted proteins may enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing to pathogenesis. Finally, we present evidence that anisomycin, a ribosome-interacting drug that reduces -1 frameshifting, also reduces toxicity, suggesting a new therapeutic opportunity for these disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the CLN3 gene as well as environmental influences. Most cases of JNCL are caused by a 1 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation predicted to leave the first 153 amino acids of the CLN3 protein intact, followed by the addition of 28 novel amino acids. Here we report the discovery of a novel mutation identified as a G to T transversion at nucleotide 49 (G49T) in exon 2 of CLN3, introducing a premature stop codon (E17X) near the N-terminus. This mutation represents the most 5' mutation described to date. The patient examined in this study was heterozygous for the common 1 kb deletion and E17X. She had classical disease progression, suggesting that this mutation in CLN3 mimics the more prevalent 1 kb deletion and that progression of JNCL is predominantly the result of loss of CLN3 function.</AbstractText>"}

Disturbances of ER calcium homeostasis constitute a severe form of stress interfering with central functions of this structure including the folding and processing of newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins. Blocking the folding and processing reactions results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins forming potentially toxic aggregates. To restore ER functioning, specific stress responses are activated one of which is the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is characterized by a shutdown of global protein synthesis and activation of expression of genes coding for ER-resident proteins that are involved in the folding and processing reactions. ER calcium homeostasis is therefore inevitably associated with major cellular functions, including gene transcription and translation. ER calcium homeostasis und ER functions are believed to be impaired in various degenerative diseases of the brain including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ER functioning has also been shown to be disturbed in acute pathological states of the brain such as ischemia and trauma, which have been identified as risk factors for the development of degenerative diseases. This implies that there are common underlying pathomechanisms. This review will summarize new observations suggesting that impairment of ER functioning may be a common denominator of pathological processes resulting in neuronal cell injury in acute disorders and degenerative diseases of the brain.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, CLN8 was linked to a large eukaryotic protein family of TLC (TRAM, Lag1, CLN8) domain homologues with postulated functions in lipid synthesis, transport or sensing. By using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry we analysed molecular species of major phosholipid and simple sphingolipid classes from cerebral samples of two EPMR patients representing a progressive and advanced state of the disease. The progressive state brain showed reduced levels of ceramide, galactosyl- and lactosylceramide and sulfatide as well as a decrease in long fatty acyl chain containing molecular species within these classes. Among glycerophospholipid classes, an increase in species containing polyunsaturated acyl chains was detected especially in phosphatidylserines and phosphatidylethanolamines. By contrast, saturated and monounsaturated species were overrepresented among phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol classes in the advanced state sample. The observed changes in brain sphingo- and phospholipid molecular profiles may result in altered membrane stability, lipid peroxidation, vesicular trafficking or neurotransmission and thus may contribute to the progression of the molecular pathogenesis of EPMR.</AbstractText>"}

We found that the APPV715F substitution, which has been previously shown to dramatically decrease Abeta40 and Abeta42 while increasing Abeta38 levels, does not affect in vitro generation of AICD.

Two Hungarian compound heterozygote brothers inherited the same TPI mutations (F240L and E145Stop), but only the younger one suffers from neurodegeneration. In the present study, we determined the kinetic parameters of key glycolytic enzymes including the mutant TPI for rational modelling of erythrocyte glycolysis. We found that a low TPI activity in the mutant cells (lower than predicted from the protein level and specific activity of the purified recombinant enzyme) is coupled with an increase in the activities of glycolytic kinases. The modelling rendered it possible to establish the steady-state flux of the glycolysis and metabolite concentrations, which was not possible experimentally due to the inactivation of the mutant TPI and other enzymes during the pre-steady state. Our results showed that the flux was 2.5-fold higher and the concentration of DHAP (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased 40- and 5-fold respectively in the erythrocytes of the patient compared with the control. Although the rapid equilibration of triosephosphates is not achieved, the energy state of the cells is not 'sick' due to the activation of key regulatory enzymes. In lymphocytes of the two brothers, the TPI activity was also lower (20%) than that of controls; however, the remaining activity was high enough to maintain the rapid equilibration of triosephosphates; consequently, no accumulation of DHAP occurs, as judged by our experimental and computational data. Interestingly, we found significant differences in the mRNA levels of the brothers for TPI and some other, apparently unrelated, proteins. One of them is the prolyl oligopeptidase, the activity decrease of which has been reported in well-characterized neurodegenerative diseases.

Alpha-synuclein is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathogenicity of alpha-synuclein is related to its ability to form intraneuronal inclusions. The inclusions, which are found in brains of patients with PD and diffuse Lewy body disease consist partially of C-terminally truncated alpha-synuclein. This alpha-synuclein species has an increased ability to form aggregates compared to full length alpha-synuclein.2. We have used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector system to overexpress either C-terminally truncated or full length alpha-synuclein containing the A53T mutation, which have both been identified in brains of familial PD patients and transgenic mouse models. Dissociated mesencephalic neurons, cerebellar granule neurons, and organotypic midbrain slice cultures were infected with AAV containing the transgene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter.3. We demonstrate that viral overexpression of alpha-synuclein(A53T) leads to the formation of distorted neurites, intraneuritic swellings, and granular perikaryal deposits in cultured neurons. Our results indicate that these cell culture models may represent an early phase of PD reflecting pathologic neuritic alterations before significant neuronal cell loss occurs.</AbstractText>"}

There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that these compounds are neurotoxic, and it has been recently hypothesized that neurodegenerative disorders may be associated with increased levels of these biogenic aldehydes. Aldehyde dehydrogenases are a group of NAD(P)+ -dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes, such as those derived from catecholamines, to their corresponding carboxylic acids. To date, 19 aldehyde dehydrogenase genes have been identified in the human genome. Mutations in these genes and subsequent inborn errors in aldehyde metabolism are the molecular basis of several diseases, including Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, type II hyperprolinemia, gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures, most of which are characterized by neurological abnormalities. Several pharmaceutical agents and environmental toxins are also known to disrupt or inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase function. It is, therefore, possible to speculate that reduced detoxification of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde from impaired or deficient aldehyde dehydrogenase function may be a contributing factor in the suggested neurotoxicity of these compounds. This article presents a comprehensive review of what is currently known of both the neurotoxicity and respective metabolism pathways of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde with an emphasis on the role that aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes play in the detoxification of these two aldehydes.</AbstractText>"}

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Friedreich ataxia patients compared with age-matched controls revealed smaller and irregularly shaped dentate nuclei with significantly (P &lt; .027) higher H-relaxation rates R2*, indicating regional iron accumulation. A 6-month treatment with 20 to 30 mg/kg/d deferiprone of 9 adolescent patients with no overt cardiomyopathy reduced R2* from 18.3 s(-1) (+/- 1.6 s(-1)) to 15.7 s(-1) (+/- 0.7 s(-1); P &lt; .002), specifically in dentate nuclei and proportionally to the initial R2* (r = 0.90). Chelator treatment caused no apparent hematologic or neurologic side effects while reducing neuropathy and ataxic gait in the youngest patients.

They were developed for the treatment of comorbidity of dementia with Parkinsonism. In the present study, we determined the effects of these drugs on both aminergic neurotransmitter levels and motor behavioral activity in naïve and in L-dopa- or L-tryptophan-induced rats. Chronic treatment of rats with ladostigil (52 mg kg(-1) for 21 days) inhibited hippocampal and striatal MAO A and B activities by &gt;90%, increased striatal levels of dopamine and serotonin, and inhibited striatal ChE activity by approximately 50%. Chronic TV3279 (26 mg kg(-1) for 21 days) similarly inhibited approximately 50% of striatal ChE activity, but did not affect MAO activity or amine levels. In sharp contrast to the inductive effect of the MAO A/B inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP), on stereotyped hyperactivity in response to L-dopa (50 mg kg(-1)) or L-tryptophan (100 mg kg(-1)), ladostigil completely inhibited these behavioral hyperactivity syndromes. Accordingly, acute rivastigmine (2 mg kg(-1)) and chronic TV3279 abolished the ability of TCP to initiate L-dopa-induced hyperactivity, while scopolamine (0.5 mg kg(-1)) reversed the inhibitory effect of chronic ladostigil on L-dopa-induced hyperactivity, suggesting that ladostigil may attenuate successive locomotion by activating central cholinergic muscarinic receptors.Finally, while chronic ladostigil administration to naïve rats resulted in preserved spontaneous motor behavior, acute treatment with ladostigil decreased motor performance, compared to control animals. In contrast, chronic as well as acute treatments with TV3279 reduced spontaneous motor activity. Thus, the aminergic potentiation by ladostigil may counteract its cholinergic inhibitory effect on spontaneous motor behavior. Our results suggest that potentiation of both aminergic and cholinergic transmission systems by ladostigil contributes equally to motor behavior performance, which is substantially impaired in comorbidity of dementia with Parkinsonism including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).</AbstractText>"}

Oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), which normally mature into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, are typically present around demyelinated lesions but do not remyelinate affected axons. Here, we find that the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan accumulates in demyelinated lesions from individuals with multiple sclerosis and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A high molecular weight (HMW) form of hyaluronan synthesized by astrocytes accumulates in chronic demyelinated lesions. This form of hyaluronan inhibits remyelination after lysolecithin-induced white matter demyelination. OPCs accrue and do not mature into myelin-forming cells in demyelinating lesions where HMW hyaluronan is present. Furthermore, the addition of HMW hyaluronan to OPC cultures reversibly inhibits progenitor-cell maturation, whereas degrading hyaluronan in astrocyte-OPC cocultures promotes oligodendrocyte maturation.

The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are thought to be the major contributors to complement-mediated inflammation in the CNS, likely mediating their effects via their ability to attract and activate leukocytes and common capacity to augment inflammation. For example, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the animal model of multiple sclerosis, CNS-specific expression of C3a in C3a/GFAP transgenic mice renders them prone to massive cellular infiltration of the CNS and increases their mortality. In contrast, other studies have suggested that C3a can function in an anti-inflammatory fashion in the CNS, by inducing neurotrophin production and preventing NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity. To further investigate the seemingly paradoxical role of C3a in acute inflammation of the brain, we studied the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock in C3a/GFAP transgenic, C3a receptor-deficient (C3aR-/-) and C3a/GFAPxC3aR-/- mutant mice. Here we report that C3a/GFAP mice were significantly more resistant to endotoxin-induced lethality than wild-type and C3aR-/- mice. Surprisingly, C3a/GFAPxC3aR-/- hybrids were also significantly protected, indicating that C3a exerts its protective anti-inflammatory effect either directly or via an as yet unidentified non-canonical C3aR.</AbstractText>"}

NCV and CMAP were assessed by surface electroneurography of the right peroneal nerve conducted in 1162 participants, 515 men and 647 women, age 21-96 years, free of major neurological diseases. Cross-sectional muscle area and calf muscle density were measured using peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). Both nerve and muscle parameters declined with age although in most cases the decline was not linear. In both sexes, CMAP, but not NCV, was independently and significantly associated with calf muscle density.

This review focuses on the neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions of estrogen in the brain, with particular emphasis on estrogen actions in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum. Sex differences in the risk, onset and severity of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke are well known, and the potential role of estrogen as a neuroprotective factor is discussed in this context. The review assimilates a complex literature that spans research in humans, non-human primates and rodent animal models and attempts to contrast and compare the findings across species where possible. Current controversies regarding the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, its ramifications, concerns and the new studies needed to address these concerns are also addressed. Signaling mechanisms underlying estrogen-induced neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity are reviewed, including the important concepts of genomic versus nongenomic mechanisms, types of estrogen receptor involved and their subcellular targeting, and implicated downstream signaling pathways and mediators. Finally, a multicellular mode of estrogen action in the regulation of neuronal survival and neurotrophism is discussed, as are potential future directions for the field.</AbstractText>"}

Despite the protein's putative function in presynaptic vesicle regulation, the roles of lipid binding in modulating alpha-synuclein conformations and the aggregation process remain to be fully understood. This study focuses on a detailed thermodynamic characterization of monomeric alpha-synuclein folding in the presence of SDS, a well-studied lipid mimetic. Far-UV CD spectroscopy was employed for detection of conformational transitions induced by SDS, temperature, and pH. The data we present here clearly demonstrate the multistate nature of alpha-synuclein folding, which involves two predominantly alpha-helical partially folded thermodynamic intermediates that we designate as F (most folded) and I (intermediately folded) states. Likely structures of these alpha-synuclein conformational states are also discussed. These partially folded forms can exist in the presence of either monomeric or micellar forms of SDS, which suggests that alpha-synuclein has an intrinsic propensity for adopting multiple alpha-helical structures even in the absence of micelle or membrane binding, a feature that may have implications for its biological activity and toxicity. Additionally, we discuss the relation between alpha-synuclein three-state folding and its aggregation, within the context of isothermal titration calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy measurements of SDS-initiated oligomer formation.</AbstractText>"}

The purpose of this study was to determine the upstream mechanism(s) that initiates the signaling cascade leading to E2-inducible neuroprotection. We tested the hypothesis that E2 activates rapid Ca(2+) influx in hippocampal neurons, which would lead to activation of the Src/ERK signaling cascade and up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Using fura-2 ratiometric Ca(2+) imaging, we demonstrated that E2 induced a rapid rise of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) within minutes of exposure which was blocked by an L-type Ca(2+) channel antagonist. Inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) channels resulted in a loss of E2 activation of the Src/ERK cascade, activation of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and subsequent increase in Bcl-2. Real-time intracellular Ca(2+) imaging combined with pERK immunofluorescence, demonstrated that E2 induced [Ca(2+)](i) was coincident with ERK activation in the same neuron. Small interfering RNA knockdown of CREB resulted in a loss of E2 activation of CREB and subsequent E2-induced increase of Bcl-2 expression. We further demonstrated the presence of specific membrane E2 binding sites in hippocampal neurons. Together, these data indicate that E2-induced Ca(2+) influx via the L-type Ca(2+) channel is required for E2 activation of the Src/ERK/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling.

MRI volumetry and DTI were combined to investigate 18 MCI patients attending a memory clinic, and 18 carefully age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Neuropsychological testing, high resolution T1-weighted volume MRI scans, and DTI scans with regions-of-interest in hippocampal areas were applied. Left hippocampal volume was significantly lower (-11%, P = 0.02) in MCI patients than in control subjects. No significant differences were found for the right hippocampus (-4%). Mean diffusivity (MD) was significantly elevated in MCI patients vs. controls in left (+10%, P = 0.002) and right hippocampal areas (+13%, P = 0.02). Hippocampal volume and MD values were not significantly correlated. Combining left hippocampal volume and MD measures showed that lower left hippocampal volumes were associated with poor verbal memory performance particularly when co-occurring with high MD values. No comparable associations could be found regarding the right hippocampal formation and with respect to non-verbal memory function. The results demonstrate that microstructural abnormalities as revealed by DTI are very sensitive early indicators of hippocampal dysfunction. The combination of macro- and microstructural parameters in hippocampal areas could be promising in early detection of neurodegenerative processes.</AbstractText>"}

We conducted a study to assess the effect of IL-1 on the TBI-induced death of hippocampal neurons. After TBI was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats under anesthesia, we evaluated neuronal damage score through microscopic examination and Pulsinelli's grading system. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to measure the levels of IL-1alpha and IL- 1beta in brain tissue at different points after the induction of TBI. Over a 4-day period, the specific sites of release of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta in the brain were elucidated by immunocytochemistry with double- labeling. TBI to the hippocampus was followed by disruption of the blood-brain barrier and severe neuronal loss. Levels of IL-1alpha RNA and protein were significantly elevated at 3 h after TBI, peaked at 12 h, and remained elevated for 168 h. IL-1beta RNA and protein expression were also elevated at 3 h after TBI, but remained so only for 48 h. Our findings indicate that the observed TBI-induced increases in IL-1alpha and IL-1beta occur largely through release of these cytokines from neurons and astrocytes, respectively. Intraventricular administration of antibodies to IL-1alpha and IL-1beta before TBI significantly attenuated the TBI-induced loss of hippocampal neurons. These results show that IL-1alpha and IL-1beta play important roles in the TBI-induced loss of hippocampal neurons.</AbstractText>"}

HD was one of the first neurological disorders for which accurate transgenic models were created, allowing mechanisms of pathogenesis to be explored at molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. In the last decade, the understanding of molecular and cellular changes which occur in HD prior to onset of symptoms, and at early and late stages of disease progression, has been greatly expanded. A wide range of potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention have been identified, associated with a variety of cellular processes including gene transcription, protein trafficking, protein degradation, protein-protein interactions, glutamatergic synaptic transmission, presynaptic signalling, postsynaptic signalling, synaptic plasticity, dopaminergic and neurotrophic modulation of synaptic function, experience-dependent neurogenesis, mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism. Presymptomatic testing for the HD gene mutation necessitates future development of novel therapeutics aimed at delaying onset of symptoms, as well as slowing or reversing disease progression.</AbstractText>"}

In the present study, we examined the distribution of reelin-immunoreactivity (-ir) in the hippocampal formation of 9-month-old wildtype mice (WT). Then, reelin-ir in normal mice was compared to that of transgenic mice (APP/PS1) carrying mutated human APP and PS1 genes, which are linked to the familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APP/PS1 mice were additionally burdened with a second risk factor for AD, namely depletion of circulating gonadal hormones by ovariectomy (APP/PS1 + OVX). The analyses revealed that in adult WT reelin-ir is expressed by Cajal-Retzius cells and a subgroup of interneurons throughout the hippocampal formation. In addition, layer II projection neurons in the lateral entorhinal subfields are reelin-ir. Interestingly, ovariectomy decreases the number of reelin-ir cells in the hilus in WT mice, whereas AD-related genotype alone induces only a non-significant reduction. Unexpectedly, additional stress, e.g., depletion of gonadal hormones, does not aggravate the slight reduction in the reelin cell number in the APP/PS1 mice. We propose that the changes in normal reelin-ir are linked to disturbances in repair mechanisms in which APP/PS1 and gonadal hormones are involved and which are perturbed in neurodegenerative conditions, namely AD.</AbstractText>"}

SCa transports microtubules and neurofilaments at average rates of approximately 0.2-1 mm/d, whereas SCb translocates approximately 200 diverse proteins critical for axonal growth, regeneration, and synaptic function at average rates of approximately 2-8 mm/d. Several neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by abnormalities in one or more SCb proteins, but little is known about mechanisms underlying SCb compared with FC and SCa. Here, we use live-cell imaging to visualize and quantify the axonal transport of three SCb proteins, alpha-synuclein, synapsin-I, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in cultured hippocampal neurons, and directly compare their transport to synaptophysin, a prototypical FC protein. All three SCb proteins move rapidly but infrequently with pauses during transit, unlike synaptophysin, which moves much more frequently and persistently. By simultaneously visualizing the transport of proteins at high temporal and spatial resolution, we show that the dynamics of alpha-synuclein transport are distinct from those of synaptophysin but similar to other SCb proteins. Our observations of the cotransport of multiple SCb proteins in single axons suggest that they move as multiprotein complexes.

Owing to its neuroprotective and procognitive effects, transdermal nicotine was proposed to be an effective treatment of some neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Mice deficient in the dopamine transporter (DAT KO) exhibit a phenotype reminiscent of schizophrenia and ADHD, including hyperdopaminergia, hyperactivity, paradoxical calming by methylphenidate and cognitive deficits, some of which being improved by antipsychotic agents. We recently demonstrated that nicotinic receptor content and function were profoundly modified in DAT KO mice. In this study, we assessed the effects of a chronic nicotine treatment in the drinking water on the nicotine-induced locomotion, anxiety status and learning performance. Chronically nicotine-treated DAT KO mice were always hypersensitive to the hypolocomotor effect of nicotine without tolerance and did not exhibit the anxiogenic effect of nicotine treatment observed in WT mice. Very interestingly, both acute and chronic nicotine treatments greatly improved their deficits in the cued and spatial learning, without eliciting tolerance. We speculate that the procognitive effects of nicotine in DAT KO mice are related to the upregulation of alpha7 nicotinic receptors in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prelimbic cortex, all areas involved in cognition. Data from our studies on DAT KO mice shed light on the nicotine self-medication in psychiatric patients and suggest that nicotinic agonists could favorably lead to additional therapy of psychiatric diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We show here that hsp104 and hsp27 rescue striatal dysfunction in primary neuronal cultures and HD rat models based on lentiviral-mediated overexpression of a mutated htt fragment. In primary rat striatal cultures, production of hsp104 or hsp27 with htt171-82Q restored neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-positive cell density to that measured after infection with vector expressing the wild-type htt fragment (htt171-19Q). In vivo, both chaperones significantly reduced mutated-htt-related loss of DARPP-32 expression. Furthermore, hsps affected the distribution and size of htt inclusions, with the density of neuritic aggregates being remarkably increased in striatal neurons overexpressing hsps. We also found that htt171-82Q induced the up-regulation of endogenous hsp70 that was co-localized with htt inclusions, and that the overexpression of hsp104 and hsp27 modified the subcellular localization of hsp70 that became cytoplasmic. Finally, hsp104 induced the production of endogenous hsp27. These data demonstrate the protective effects of chaperones in mammalian models of HD.</AbstractText>"}

Remarkable progress has been made in the past decade to understand the cellular and molecular events that occur in PD. However attempts to unravel the early, initiating factors in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic neurodegeneration and PD have been limited by the lack of a suitable animal model. Models in which there has been genetic or environmental manipulation are not of use in determining the natural cause of a disease. While a large scale prospective human study would be ideal, the relatively low prevalence of PD makes this approach economically and logistically infeasible. Equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is a spontaneous, progressive neuroendocrine disease that commonly affects aged horses and ponies. PPID results from neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic periventricular neurons that innervate the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. PPID is 10-20 times more prevalent than PD and may be readily diagnosed without a need for advanced imaging technology. Although the diseases are anatomically distinct, recent evidence suggests the pathogenesis of dopaminergic neuronal damage in PPID may have significant similarities to that of PD. In this review, the similarities and differences in the pathology of neurodegeneration in PPID and PD are compared. The potential utility of the horse as a model of spontaneous dopaminergic neurodegeneration is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we studied the frequency of this allele and found it to be among the most common genetic causes of inherited ataxia in Finland. We identified 27 patients with mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) from 15 Finnish families, with a carrier frequency in the general population of 1 : 125. Since the mutation pair W748S+E1143G has also been described in European patients, we examined the haplotypes of 13 non-Finnish, European patients with the W748S mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that all the chromosomes carrying these two changes, in patients from Finland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, originate from a common ancient founder. In Finland and Norway, long, common, northern haplotypes, outside the core haplotype, could be identified. Despite having identical homozygous mutations, the Finnish patients with this adult- or juvenile-onset disease had surprisingly heterogeneous phenotypes, albeit with a characteristic set of features, including ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, mild cognitive impairment, involuntary movements, psychiatric symptoms, and epileptic seizures. The high carrier frequency in Finland, the high number of patients in Norway, and the ancient European founder chromosome indicate that this newly identified ataxia should be considered in the first-line differential diagnosis of progressive ataxia syndromes.</AbstractText>"}

SBMA is caused by mutation of the expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the AR gene. Recently, we established a Drosophila SBMA model that expresses the expanded polyQ hAR mutant in eyes, which monitors neurodegeneration as a rough eye phenotype. In addition, we showed that androgen binding to the mutant hAR causes structural alterations, leading to the onset of neurodegeneration in the fly eyes. In the present study, we examined whether the ligand-induced neurodegeneration via the hAR mutant is coupled with the known ligand-induced transactivation function of hAR. By testing several known AR antagonists and several of their structure-related compounds, we unexpectedly found that none of the AR ligands antagonized the hAR mutant neurodegeneration function, and surprisingly, compound 4-(4,4-dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-1-imidazolidinyl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile (RU56279) was more potent in inducing neurodegeneration. However, in vitro and in vivo mammalian assays showed that RU56279 exhibited the expected antagonistic activity with the same potency as those of the other compounds. Thus, these findings suggest the presence of a novel ligand-induced function of the polyQ hAR mutant in neurodegeneration that could not be prevented by known antagonists for the hAR transactivation function.</AbstractText>"}

Eyes of aged, targeted replacement mice expressing human apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 and maintained on a HF-C diet show apoE isoform-dependent pathologies of differential severity. ApoE4 mice are the most severely affected. They develop a constellation of changes that mimic the pathology associated with human AMD. These alterations include diffuse sub-retinal pigment epithelial deposits, drusenoid deposits, thickened Bruch's membrane, and atrophy, hypopigmentation, and hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium. In extreme cases, apoE4 mice also develop marked choroidal neovascularization, a hallmark of exudative AMD. Neither age nor HF-C diet alone is sufficient to elicit these changes. We document choroidal neovascularization and other AMD-like ocular pathologies in an animal model that exploits known AMD risk factors. The model is additionally attractive because it is not complicated by invasive experimental intervention. Our findings in this model implicate the human apoE E4 allele as a susceptibility gene for AMD and support the hypothesis that common pathogenic mechanisms may underlie AMD and Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

To investigate the role of PINK1 in neurodegeneration, we designed human and murine neuronal cell lines expressing either wild-type PINK1 or PINK1 bearing a mutation associated with Parkinson Disease. We show that under basal and staurosporine-induced conditions, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was lower in wild-type PINK1 expressing SH-SY5Y cells than in mock-transfected cells. This phenotype was due to a PINK1-mediated reduction in cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which prevents subsequent caspase-3 activation. We show that overexpression of wild-type PINK1 strongly reduced both basal and staurosporine-induced caspase 3 activity. Overexpression of wild-type PINK1 also reduced the levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7, and activated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase under both basal and staurosporine-induced conditions. In contrast, Parkinson disease-related mutations and a kinase-inactive mutation in PINK1 abrogated the protective effect of PINK1. Together, these results suggest that PINK1 reduces the basal neuronal pro-apoptotic activity and protects neurons from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Loss of this protective function may therefore underlie the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons in patients with PINK1 mutations.</AbstractText>"}

Our data provide the first direct demonstration that mid-age neurons in comparison to young neurons manifest significant elevations in basal [Ca(2+)](i) levels. Upon glutamate stimulation and a subsequent [Ca(2+)](i) load, mid-age neurons took longer to remove the excess [Ca(2+)](i) in comparison to young neurons, providing direct evidence that altered Ca(2+) homeostasis may be present in animals at significantly younger ages than those that are commonly considered aged (&gt; or =24 months). These alterations in Ca(2+) dynamics may render aging neurons more vulnerable to neuronal death following stroke, seizures or head trauma. Elucidating the functionality of Ca(2+) homeostatic mechanisms may offer an understanding of the increased neuronal loss that occurs with aging, and allow for the development of novel therapeutic agents targeted towards decreasing [Ca(2+)](i) levels thereby restoring the systems that maintain normal Ca(2+) homeostasis in aged neurons.</AbstractText>"}

EAE and MS are characterized by CNS inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration. The inflammatory response occurring within the CNS leads to glial activation, dysfunction and death, as well as axonal damage and neurological deficit. Although the pathogenic mechanisms involved in EAE/MS are not well understood, accumulating data suggest that oxidative stress plays a major role in lesion development, and contributes to axonal dysfunction and degeneration. Metallothionein-I and -II are anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant proteins expressed during EAE and MS, in which they might play a protective role. The present study aimed to describe the expression profile of a group of inflammatory, neurodegenerative and tissue repair markers as well as metallothioneins during proteolipid protein-induced EAE, and to establish the time-relationships these molecules had during EAE. Interestingly, we found two marker expression profiles. In the first, marker expression increased as clinical signs worsened and reverted to baseline expression during recovery; in the second, marker expression increased at a later point during relapse, peaked at highest clinical score, and remained elevated throughout recovery. Of note, metallothionein expression was found to be related to the second profile, which would suggest that metallothionein proteins are implicated in the clinical recovery of EAE and perhaps these antioxidant proteins may provide therapeutic benefits in MS.</AbstractText>"}

Whether activated human MDMs positioned in the basal ganglia affect hippocampal neuronal plasticity, the brain subregion involved in learning and memory, is unknown. Thus, immunohistochemical techniques were used for detection of newborn neurons (polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule [PSA-NCAM]) and cell proliferation (Ki-67) to assay MDM effects on neuronal development in mouse models of HIV-1 encephalitis. Immunodeficient (C.B.-17/SCID and nonobese diabetic/SCID, NOD/SCID) and immune competent (C.B.-17) mice were injected with uninfected or HIV-1-infected MDM. Sham-operated or unmanipulated mice served as controls. Neuronal plasticity was evaluated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) at days 7 and 28. By day 7, increased numbers of Ki-67+ cells, PSA-NCAM+ cells and dendrites in DG were observed in sham-operated animals. In contrast, significant reductions in neuronal precursors and altered neuronal morphology paralleled increased microglial activation in both HIV-1-infected and uninfected MDM-injected animals. DG cellular composition was restored at day 28. We posit that activated MDM induce inflammation and diminish DG neuronal plasticity.

It was recently proposed that in addition to glucose, neurons might rely on lactate to sustain their activity. Therefore, it was demonstrated that lactate is a preferred oxidative substrate for neurons not only in vitro but also in vivo. Moreover, the presence of specific monocarboxylate transporters on neurons as well as on astrocytes is consistent with the hypothesis of a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons. Evidence has been provided for a mechanism whereby astrocytes respond to glutamatergic activity by enhancing their glycolytic activity, resulting in increased lactate release. This is accomplished via the uptake of glutamate by glial glutamate transporters, leading to activation of the Na+/K+ ATPase and a stimulation of astrocytic glycolysis. Several recent observations obtained both in vitro and in vivo with different approaches have reinforced this view of brain energetics. Such an understanding might be critically important, not only because it forms the basis of some classical functional brain imaging techniques but also because several neurodegenerative diseases exhibit diverse alterations in energy metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

Our starting point to study lysosome biogenesis is to define the composition of the membrane by the use of proven methods for purification of lysosomes to near homogeneity and then to characterize membrane-associated and integral lysosomal membrane proteins. This has been achieved using advanced proteomics (electrophoretic or chromatographic separations of proteins followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometric identification of peptide sequences). To date, we have identified 55 proteins in the membrane-associated fraction and 215 proteins in the integral membrane. By applying these methods to mouse models of lysosome dysgenesis (such as BEIGE, Pale Ear, PEARL) that are related to human diseases such as Chediak-Higashi and Hermansky-Pudlak syndromes, it may be possible to define the membrane protein composition of lysosomes in each of these mutants and to determine how they differ from normal. Identifying proteins affected in the respective mutants may provide hints about how they are targeted to the lysosomal membrane and how failure to target them leads to disease; these features are pivotal to understanding lysosome biogenesis and have the potential to implicate lysosomes in a broad range of human pathologies.</AbstractText>"}

Likewise for over 100 other human diseases of protein confirmation, a common feature may be the formation of off-pathway folding intermediates that are unstable, self-associate, and with time lead to a chronic imbalance in protein homeostasis with deleterious consequences on cellular function. This has led to a hypothesis that enhancement of components of the cellular quality control machinery, specifically the levels and activities of molecular chaperones, suppress aggregation and toxicity phenotypes to allow cellular function to be restored. This review addresses the regulation of molecular chaperones and components of protein homeostasis by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the master stress-inducible regulator, and our current understanding of pharmacologically active small molecule regulators of the heat shock response as a therapeutic strategy for protein conformational diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Macro- and microglial cells have come to the forefront for their role in multistep degenerative processes in ALS and respective disease models. The activation of astroglial and microglial cells occurs early in the pathogenesis of the disease and seems to greatly influence disease onset and promotion. The role of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells remains elusive. In this review we highlight the impact of nonneuronal cells in ALS pathology. We discuss diverse glial membrane proteins that are necessary to control neuronal activity and neuronal cell survival, and summarize the contribution of these proteins to motor neuron death in ALS. We also describe recently discovered glial mechanisms that promote motor neuron degeneration using state-of-the-art genetic mouse technology. Finally, we provide an outlook on the extent to which these new pathomechanistic insights may offer novel therapeutic approaches.</AbstractText>"}

One hundred and twenty polymorphisms were identified and tested in stage 1 (4 case + 4 control pools totaling 366 case and 366 control individuals). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing evidence of association with LOAD were then studied in stage 2 (8 case + 4 control pools totaling 1,001 case and 1,001 control individuals). Five SNPs, in four genes, showed evidence for association (P &lt; 0.1) at stage 2 and were individually genotyped in the complete dataset, comprising 1,160 LOAD cases and 1,389 normal controls.

Despite considerable efforts, the function of Huntingtin as well as the precise molecular mechanisms by which the expanded polyQ elicits cellular dysfunction remain unclear. In addition, no treatment is available to prevent, cure, or even slow down the progression of this devastating disorder. Antibodies are valuable tools to understand protein function and disease mechanisms. Here, we have identified the epitope recognized by the mAb 2B4, a broadly used antibody generated against the amino-terminal region of Huntingtin, which detects both aggregated and soluble Huntingtin. The 2B4 antibody specifically recognizes amino acids 50-64 of human Huntingtin but not the murine homologous region. Furthermore, the 2B4 epitope resides within the proline-rich region of Huntingtin, which is critical for polyQ aggregation and toxicity.

Postmortem brains of AD patients reveal neuropathological features; the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which contain beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and highly phosphorylated tau proteins. Increases in the concentration of Abeta in the course of the disease lead to gradual increase in the load of beta-amyloid plaques, which is thought to be an initial neuropathological change in AD brains. Thus, the development of radiotracers for in vivo imaging beta-amyloid plaques in the aging human brain is an important and active area of molecular imaging. When used in combination with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), amyloid imaging agents could serve as surrogate markers in early diagnosis and neuropathogenesis studies of AD. Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain could allow facilitate the evaluation of the efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies that are currently being investigated. A number of groups have worked to develop radiolabeled amyloid imaging agents, and clinical trials in AD patients have been reported with several agents including [18F]FDDNP, [11C]PIB, [11C]SB-13 and [123I]IMPY, indicating that detecting beta-amyloid plaques in the living human brain with amyloid imaging agents is potentially feasible. More recently, we have reported additional promising compounds such as flavone or chalcone derivatives. The combination of relatively high binding affinity to Abeta and high brain uptake and good clearance in mice of these flavonoid derivatives provides a series of potential amyloid imaging agents for PET and SPECT.

The pathological process associated to ALS, albeit more pronounced in the motor/premotor cortices and along the corticospinal tracts (CST), does not spare extra-motor brain gray (GM) and white (WM) matter structures. However, it remains unclear whether such extra-motor cerebral abnormalities occur with mildly disabling disease, and how irreversible tissue loss and intrinsic tissue damage are interrelated. To this end, we used an optimized version of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to investigate the patterns of regional GM density changes and to quantify GM and WM diffusivity alterations of the entire brain from mildly disabled patients with ALS. A high-resolution T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo and a pulsed gradient spin-echo single shot echo-planar sequence of the brain were acquired from 25 mildly disabled patients with ALS and 18 matched healthy controls. An analysis of covariance was used to compare volumetry and diffusivity measurements between patients and controls. Compared with controls, ALS patients had significant clusters of locally reduced GM density (P &lt; 0.001) in the right premotor cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and superior temporal gyrus (STG), bilaterally. In ALS patients contrasted to controls, we also found significant clusters of locally increased MD (P &lt; 0.001) in the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the WM adjacent to the IFG, STG, and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) of the right hemisphere, and in the WM adjacent to the MTG and lingual gyrus in the left hemisphere. Compared with controls, ALS patients also had significant clusters of locally decreased FA values (P &lt; 0.001) in the CST in the midbrain and corpus callosum, bilaterally.

Here we show that a beta-sheet conformational transition of the expanded polyQ protein monomer precedes its assembly into beta-sheet-rich amyloid-like fibrils. Microinjection of the various polyQ protein conformers into cultured cells revealed that the soluble beta-sheet monomer causes cytotoxicity. The polyQ-binding peptide QBP1 prevents the toxic beta-sheet conformational transition of the expanded polyQ protein monomer. We conclude that the toxic conformational transition, and not simply the aggregation process itself, is a therapeutic target for polyQ diseases and possibly for conformational diseases in general.</AbstractText>"}

On the injured side of SC in control, there were no responses of IN and MN on ipsilateral G and P stimulation, while responses were elicited on contralateral nerve stimulation. The neuron responses on the intact side of SC were revealed in a reverse ratio.

This was also testified by the atrophy of the distal stump and the absence of motor activity of the affected limb. In PRP-1-treated animals, the responses of SC IN and MN in postaxotomy 3 weeks on the injured side of SC at ipsilateral nerve stimulation and on the intact side at contralateral nerve stimulation were recorded because of the obvious fusion of the severed nerve stumps. The histochemical data confirmed the electrophysiological findings.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of curcumin, a potent polyphenol antioxidant enriched in tumeric. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in Mongolian gerbils by transient occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Histochemical analysis indicated extensive neuronal death together with increased reactive astrocytes and microglial cells in the hippocampal CA1 area at 4 days after I/R. These ischemic changes were preceded by a rapid increase in lipid peroxidation and followed by decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytochrome c release, and subsequently caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Administration of curcumin by i.p. injections (30 mg/kg body wt) or by supplementation to the AIN76 diet (2.0 g/kg diet) for 2 months significantly attenuated ischemia-induced neuronal death as well as glial activation. Curcumin administration also decreased lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the apoptotic indices. The biochemical changes resulting from curcumin also correlated well with its ability to ameliorate the changes in locomotor activity induced by I/R. Bioavailability study indicated a rapid increase in curcumin in plasma and brain within 1 hr after treatment. Together, these findings attribute the neuroprotective effect of curcumin against I/R-induced neuronal damage to its antioxidant capacity in reducing oxidative stress and the signaling cascade leading to apoptotic cell death.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In humans this system also controls energy homeostasis and mainly influences the function of the food intake centers of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract activity. The endocannabinoid system regulates not only the central and peripheral mechanisms of food intake, but also lipids synthesis and turnover in the liver and adipose tissue as well as glucose metabolism in muscle cells. Rimonabant, a new and selective central and peripheral cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) blocker, has been shown to reduce body weight and improve cardiovascular risk factor (metabolic syndrome) in obese patients by increasing HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin blood levels as well as decreasing LDL-cholesterol, leptin, and C-reactive protein (a proinflammatory marker) concentrations.

Patients with ALS included 30 patients who showed a rapid progression of disease, and 30 patients that showed a slower progression. EPO was measured using ELISA technique. We found CSF EPO levels to be lower in ALS as compared to AD and controls (p&lt;0.05), while no differences were found with regard to serum levels. Patients with ALS who showed a rapid disease progression had lower CSF EPO levels compared to those who progressed more slowly (p=0.03). Low CSF EPO in ALS may imply that the EPO-associated capacity to protect neurons from degeneration is impaired in ALS. Low concentrations of CSF EPO seem to point towards a rapid progression of disease that may be associated with a poorer prognosis.</AbstractText>"}

GTCs, especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), lower the incidence of cancers, collagen-induced arthritis, oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative diseases, and streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Also, inhibition of adipogenesis by green tea and green tea extract has been demonstrated in cell lines, animal models, and humans. The obesity-preventive effects of green tea and its main constituent EGCG are widely supported by results from epidemiological, cell culture, animal, and clinical studies in the last decade. Studies with adipocyte cell lines and animal models have demonstrated that EGCG inhibits extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK), activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), modulates adipocyte marker proteins, and down-regulates lipogenic enzymes as well as other potential targets. Also, the catechin components of green tea have been shown to possess anti-carcinogenic properties possibly related to their anti-oxidant activity. In addition, it was shown that dietary supplementation with EGCG could potentially contribute to nutritional strategies for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this review, the biological activities and multiple mechanisms of EGCG in cell lines, animal models, and clinical observations are explained.</AbstractText>"}

Although monocyte-derived macrophages have served as models for microglia, they are limited both qualitatively and quantitatively in their immune responses and susceptibility to viral infection. Thus, the acquisition of primary human microglial cells is critical for laboratory studies of human neurological disease.

Although underlying mechanisms remain the subject of ongoing research, it is clear that aberrant processing, protein degradation, and aggregate formation or spurious protein association of the abnormal neuronal proteins may be critical factors in disease progression. Recent work in these diseases has demonstrated in vitro that specific engineered antibody species, peptides, or other general agents may suppress the formation of aggregates. We have modified an approach with intracellularly expressed single-chain Fv (sFv) antibodies (intrabodies) that bind with unique HD protein epitopes. In cell and tissue culture models of HD, anti-N-terminal huntingtin intrabodies (C4 sFv) reduce aggregation and cellular toxicity. Here, we present the crucial experiment of intrabody-mediated in vivo suppression of neuropathology, using a Drosophila model of HD. In the presence of the C4 sFv intrabody, the proportion of HD flies surviving to adulthood increases from 23% to 100%, and the mean and maximum lifespan of adult HD flies is significantly prolonged. Neurodegeneration and formation of visible huntingtin aggregates are slowed. We conclude from this investigation that engineered intrabodies are a potential new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. They may also serve as tools for drug discovery and validation of sites on mutant neuronal proteins that could be exploited for rational drug design.</AbstractText>"}

In sympathetic and trigeminal neurons, TNFalpha acts in an autocrine manner to induce immediate cell death on neurotrophic factor deprivation. In the spinal cord, TNFalpha is transiently produced by macrophages and commits motoneurons to become competent to die 2 days later. TNFalpha is also likely to induce immediate and delayed prodeath effects in adult and pathological tissues.

Potent and specific KGDHC inhibitors are needed to probe how the reduced KGDHC activity alters brain function. Previous studies showed that succinyl phosphonate (SP) effectively inhibits muscle and Escherichia coli KGDHC [Biryukov, A. I., Bunik, V. I., Zhukov, Yu. N., Khurs, E. N., and Khomutov, R. M. (1996) FEBS Lett. 382, 167-170]. To identify the phosphonates with the highest affinity toward brain KGDHC and with the greatest effect in living cells, we investigated the ability of SP and several of its ethyl esters to inhibit brain KGDHC, other alpha-keto acid-dependent enzymes, and KGDHC in intact cells. At a concentration of 0.01 mM, SP and its phosphonoethyl (PESP) and carboxyethyl (CESP) esters completely inhibited isolated brain KGDHC even in the presence of a 200-fold higher concentration of its substrate [alpha-ketoglutarate (KG)], while the diethyl (DESP) and triethyl (TESP) esters were ineffective. In cultured human fibroblasts, 0.01 mM SP, PESP, or CESP produced 70% inhibition of KGDHC. DESP and TESP were also inhibitory in the cell system, but only after preincubation, suggesting the release of their charged groups by cellular esterases. Thus, SP and its monoethyl esters target cellular KGDHC directly, while the di- and triethyl esters are activated in intact cells. When tested on other enzymes that bind KG or related alpha-keto acids, SP had minimal effects and its two esters (CESP and TESP) were ineffective even at a concentration (0.1 mM) 1 order of magnitude higher than that which inhibited cellular KGDHC activity. The high specificity in targeting KGDHC, penetration into cells, and minimal transformation by cellular enzymes indicate that SP and its esters should be useful in studying the effects of reduced KGDHC activity on neuronal and brain function.</AbstractText>"}

We used the rotenone model of experimental Parkinsonism to explore a novel aspect of extra-nigral degeneration, the neurodegeneration of spinal cord (SC), in PD. Rotenone administration to male Lewis rats caused significant neuronal cell death in cervical and lumbar SC as compared with control animals. Dying neurons were motoneurons as identified by double immunofluorescent labeling for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, recombinant-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive (TUNEL(+)) cells and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactivity. Neuronal death was accompanied by abundant astrogliosis and microgliosis as evidenced from glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactivity and OX-42-immunoreactivity, respectively, implicating an inflammatory component during neurodegeneration in SC. However, the integrity of the white matter in SC was not affected by rotenone administration as evidenced from the non co-localization of any TUNEL(+) cells with GFAP-immunoreactivity and myelin basic protein (MBP)-immunoreactivity, the selective markers for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Increased activities of 76 kD active m-calpain and 17/19 kD active caspase-3 further demonstrated involvement of these enzymes in cell death in SC. The finding of ChAT(+) cell death also suggested degeneration of SC motoneurons in rotenone-induced experimental Parkinsonism. Thus, this is the first report of its kind in which the selective vulnerability of a putative parkinsonian target outside of nigrostriatal system has been tested using an environmental toxin to understand the pathophysiology of PD.

Neurons contain the ER not only in the soma, but also in the dendrites, thus presenting a different case to non-neuronal cells. The ER in the dendrites has potential functions in local protein synthesis and sorting of synthesized proteins to postsynaptic membranes. It raises the possibility that ER stress could occur locally in the dendrites. Here we showed that ER stress sensors, inositol-requiring 1 (IRE1), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) exist in the ER of both soma and dendrites in primary mouse neurons, and that under ER stress conditions, GRP78/BiP and phosphorylated eIF2alpha are induced. Furthermore, XBP1 mRNA was localized in the proximal dendrites where IRE1 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to ER stress. These results indicate that the ER in dendrites could respond to ER stress and retain the capacity of protein quality control.</AbstractText>"}

Notably, musical stimuli have been shown to activate specific pathways in several brain areas associated with emotional behaviours, such as the insular and cingulate cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. In addition, neurochemical studies have suggested that several biochemical mediators, such as endorphins, endocannabinoids, dopamine and nitric oxide, may play a role in the musical experience. A growing body of evidence also indicates that music therapy could be useful in the clinical management of numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders.

N-Acetyl-sphingosine (C2-ceramide) induced cell death of the neuronal cell line, Cath.a-differentiated (CAD) cells, which resemble catecholaminergic cells of the CNS, and provide a useful in vitro model for the cells affected in PD. C2-ceramide also suppressed the metabolic response of CAD cells to muscarinic receptor activation. Pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (BAF) plus neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) reduced C2- ceramide-induced CAD cell death, delaying cell death more effectively than either agent alone; and, most significantly, BAF and NT-3 enabled the cells remaining 24 h after toxin treatment to generate a normal metabolic response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol. On the basis of these results, we suggest that measuring metabolic responses to receptor activation is a useful method for following neuronal viability after toxin treatment and that the combination of caspase inhibitors and neurotrophic factors might be a plausible strategy for improving neuronal survival, with critical preservation of metabolic function.</AbstractText>"}

The distribution of PrP(c) was further tested for correlation with glial reactivity. We found that PrP(c) was localized mainly in the gray matter (predominantly in neurons) and expressed at higher levels within the occipital cortex in the normal human brain. Image analysis revealed no significant variability in PrP(c) expression between DLBD and control cases. However, blood vessels within the white matter of DLBD cases showed immunoreactivity to PrP(c).

GFP170* aggregates recruit cellular chaperones and proteasomes, and alter the organization of nuclear domains containing the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. These results suggest that the formation of nuclear aggregates and their effects on nuclear architecture are not specific to poly-Q proteins. Using GFP170* as a model substrate, we explored the mechanistic details of nuclear aggregate formation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss in photobleaching analyses show that GFP170* molecules exchange rapidly between aggregates and a soluble pool of GFP170*, indicating that the aggregates are dynamic accumulations of GFP170*. The formation of cytoplasmic and nuclear GFP170* aggregates is microtubule-dependent. We show that within the nucleus, GFP170* initially deposits in small aggregates at or adjacent to PML bodies. Time-lapse imaging of live cells shows that small aggregates move toward each other and fuse to form larger aggregates. The coalescence of the aggregates is accompanied by spatial rearrangements of the PML bodies. Significantly, we find that the larger nuclear aggregates have complex internal substructures that reposition extensively during fusion of the aggregates. These studies suggest that nuclear aggregates may be viewed as dynamic multidomain inclusions that continuously remodel their components.</AbstractText>"}

Iatrogenic transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) from pituitary-derived gonadotrophins has been reported, no infectivity in urine has been demonstrated, and no definite cases of transmission via urine have been reported. It is currently not possible to monitor donor urine or finished product for the presence of prions.

Urine for the production of medicinal products should be obtained from sources that minimize the possible presence of materials derived from subjects suffering from human TSE. As no strong evidence for TSE infectivity in urine exists, it can be concluded that the risk of disease-generating prions and TSE infectivity being present in donor urine is low.

Saline or sildenafil citrate (1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered systemically 15 min before training. Drug injections occurred 24 h after pretraining rats to avoid foot shock on a one-way active avoidance straight runway. Following drug treatment, the rats received 15 training trials on a 14-unit T-maze task that requires learning a complex sequence of turns to avoid mild foot shock. This complex maze paradigm is sensitive to aging and blockade of cholinergic, N-methyl-D-aspartate and nitric oxide signaling systems. Behavioral measures of performance included deviations from the correct pathway (errors), runtime from start to goal (latency), shock frequency and shock duration. Statistical analysis revealed that central infusion of L-NAME impaired maze performance and that sildenafil (3.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the impairment. These results suggest that sildenafil citrate may serve as a cognitive enhancer by modulating central nitric oxide/cGMP signal transduction following N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. This pathway has been implicated in age-related cognitive decline and may be a useful target for pharmacological intervention of neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText>"}

HD is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the gene coding for the protein huntingtin. No proven treatment to prevent the onset or to delay the progression of HD currently exists. While a direct causative pathway from the gene mutation to the selective neostriatal neurodegeneration remains unclear, it has been hypothesized that interactions of the mutant huntingtin protein or its fragments may result in a number of interrelated pathogenic mechanisms triggering a cascade of molecular events that lead to the untimely neuronal death observed in HD. One putative pathological mechanism reported to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of HD is mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent reduction of cellular energy. Indeed, if mitochondrial impairment and reduced energy stores play roles in the neuronal loss in HD, then a therapeutic strategy that buffers intracellular energy levels may ameliorate the neurodegenerative process. Sustained ATP levels may have both direct and indirect importance in ameliorating the severity of many of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with HD. Creatine, a guanidino compound produced endogenously and acquired exogenously through diet, is a critical component in maintaining much needed cellular energy. As such, creatine is one of a number of ergogens that may provide a relatively safe and immediately available therapeutic strategy to HD patients that may be the cornerstone of a combined treatment necessary to delay the relentless progression of HD.</AbstractText>"}

We therefore tested a recently-available technique to amplify genomic DNA to see if it could reliably detect a mutation in nervous system cells. Fifty cortical motor neurons were removed by laser microdissection from cases of motor neuron disease both with and without known mutations in the gene for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). DNA was extracted and amplified with a linear genomic amplification kit (GenomiPhitrade mark). The PCR product of exon 4 of SOD1 from this DNA was then sequenced. The GenomiPhi kit amplified the extracted DNA approximately 70 times. When exon 4 of SOD1 from this DNA was amplified by PCR the E100G SOD1 mutation could be identified on sequencing. No errors in replication were found. In conclusion, the GenomiPhi method of genomic DNA amplification appears to result in reliable replication of mutations in neurons. This technique can be used to obtain increased amounts of genomic DNA to study mutations within cells of the nervous system.</AbstractText>"}

Correlation analysis with age as a covariate identified those brain regions whose fMRI signal changes were significantly related to clinical course variables in schizophrenia. The number of psychotic episodes was negatively correlated with the fMRI signal change in the right inferior frontal and the right frontal precentral gyri among the activated regions during the Stroop task in schizophrenia, whereas the length of illness was not so correlated. The number of psychotic episodes was also negatively correlated with the fMRI signal change in the left paracingulate in which functional activity was diminished in the patients relative to the controls.

We previously observed a significant increased level of DNA oxidative damage in peripheral blood cells of PD patients, with respect to controls, moreover, the activity of glutathione transferases (GSTs) measured in circulating plasma was higher in controls than in PD patients, suggesting a lower enzymatic protection in PD individuals. Among human GSTs, glutathione transferase A4-4 displays a high catalitic activity towards 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a marker of lipid peroxidation whose levels have been found significantly increased in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients, in respect to controls. We performed this study to determine the presence of allelic variants of functional interest in the coding region of the hGSTA4 gene on 60 PD patients and 60 healthy controls. By the combined effort of polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR/SSCP) techniques, we observed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G351A leading to the silent mutation Gln117Gln. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of this polymorphism between PD individuals and controls, moreover, we did not observe any other polymorphism in the hGSTA4 gene in our population. Further studies are required to test the role played by both factors regulating the level of the expression of the hGSTA4 gene and any possible post-translational modification of the protein, in the protection against oxidative damage in neuronal cells.</AbstractText>"}

Using retinal ganglion cell (E1A-NR.3) cultures, we confirmed the cytotoxicity of acrolein and 3-AP. For the first time we also demonstrated the cytotoxicity of 4-AB and the lack of toxicity of 3-AAP. Our data with 3-AAP, a product of N-acetylspermine and N-acetylspermidine metabolism, indicate that the aldehyde function of aminoaldehydes is insufficient to express toxicity since the free amino group of aminoaldehydes is also required to gain access to lysosomes where their cytotoxic actions are expressed via leakage of cathepsins that compromise mitochondrial integrity.

Activation of these regulators and duplication of chromosomes precede neurodegeneration and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), one of the diagnostic lesions of AD. These findings, in combination with evidence for cell cycle regulation of amyloid precursor protein and tau, has led to the hypothesis that reentry into the cell cycle underlies AD pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis directly, we have created transgenic mice with forced cell cycle activation in postmitotic neurons via conditional expression of the simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) oncogene. We show that TAg mice recapitulate the cell cycle changes seen in AD and display a neurodegenerative phenotype accompanied by tau pathology and NFT-like profiles. Moreover, plaque-like amyloid deposits, similar to those seen in AD, are also observed in the brains of TAg mice. These data provide support for an essential role of ectopic cell cycle activation in the generation of the characteristic pathological hallmarks of AD. Furthermore, our TAg mice are the first model to develop NFTs and amyloid pathology simultaneously and in the absence of any human transgenes. These mice will be useful for further defining the nongenetic mechanisms in AD pathogenesis and for the development of cell cycle-based therapies for AD.</AbstractText>"}

Sulfatase activities are completely absent in Sumf1(-/-) mice, indicating that Sumf1 is indispensable for sulfatase activation and that mammals, differently from bacteria, have a single sulfatase modification system. Similarly to multiple sulfatase deficiency patients, Sumf1(-/-) mice display frequent early mortality, congenital growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological defects. All examined tissues showed progressive cell vacuolization and significant lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans.

It has been shown that apo E increased the production of nitric oxide (NO) from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM); this effect could represent an important link between tissue redox balance and inflammation, since inflammation and oxidative stress are involved in chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, it has been evidenced that an overproduction of NO in the central nervous system (CNS) may play a key role in aging and that the glial cells (microglials cells and probably astrocytes) are able to form consistent amounts of NO through the induction of a nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) isoform so-called inducible or inflammatory.

Peroxynitrite and NO production and NOS expression in cultured astrocytes were measured. We observed a decreased NO production after incubation with both LDL and HDL and an increased peroxynitrite production.

This fact led us to the notion that an age-related decrease in Abeta catabolism may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of AD, providing a rationale for seeking proteolytic enzymes that degrade Abeta in the brain. Our recent studies have demonstrated that neprilysin is the most potent Abeta-degrading enzyme in vivo. Deficiency of endogenous neprilysin elevates the level of Abeta in brains of neprilysin-knockout mice in a gene dose-dependent manner, and an age-associated decline of neprilysin occurs in several regions of mouse brain. Neuropathological alterations in these same regions have been implicated in cognitive impairments of AD patients at an early stage of the disease. Furthermore, the level of neprilysin mRNA has been found to be significantly and selectively reduced in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of AD patients. A clarification of the role played by decreased neprilysin activity in the pathogenesis of AD has opened up the possibility of neprilysin up-regulation as a novel preventive and therapeutic approach to AD. Since the expression level and activity of neprilysin are likely to be regulated by neuropeptides and their receptors, non-peptidic agonists for these receptors might be effective agents to maintain a sufficient level of Abeta catabolism in brains of the elderly. In addition to Abeta deposits, intraneuronal fibrillary lesions, such as neurofibrillary tangles, are also a pathological hallmark of AD, and the extent of the resultant cytoskeletal disruptions may be dependent upon the activity levels of proteolytic enzymes. Among proteases for which major cytoskeletal components are good substrates, calpains were shown to participate in excitotoxic stress-induced neuritic degeneration in our recent analysis using genetically engineered mice. Moreover, we have found that this pathology can be reduced by controlling the activity of an endogenous calpain inhibitor known as calpastatin, providing a possible approach for the treatment of diverse neurodegenerative disorders, including AD.</AbstractText>"}

One type of mitochondrial decay is oxidative modification of key mitochondrial enzymes. Enzyme dysfunction, that is due to poor binding of substrates and coenzymes may be ameliorated by supplementing adequate levels of substrates or coenzyme precursors. Such supplementation with mitochondrial nutrients (mt-nutrients) may be useful to prevent or delay mitochondrial decay, thus prevent or treat AD and PD. In the present review, we survey the literature to identify mt-nutrients that can (1) protect mitochondrial enzymes and/or stimulate enzyme activity by elevating levels of substrates and cofactors; (2) induce phase-2 enzymes to enhance antioxidant defenses; (3) scavenge free radicals and prevent oxidant production in mitochondria, and (4) repair mitochondrial membrane. Then, we discuss the relationships among mt-nutrient deficiency, mitochondrial decay, and cognitive dysfunction, and summarize available evidence suggesting an effect of mt-nutrient supplementation on AD and PD. It appears that greater effects might be obtained by longer-term administration of combinations of mt-nutrients. Thus, optimal doses of combinations of mt-nutrients to delay and repair mitochondrial decay could be a strategy for preventing and treating cognitive dysfunction, including AD and PD.</AbstractText>"}

Significant increase in galanin expression is observed after peripheral nerve injury, in the basal forebrain in Alzheimer's disease (AD), during neuronal development, and after stimulation with estrogen, while seizure activity deplete galanin in the hippocampus. A wide distribution of galanin and its receptors is seen in the nervous system, often in co-localization with classical neurotransmitters and other neuromodulators. Galanin acts predominantly as an inhibitory, hyperpolarizing neuromodulator on neurotransmitter and glucose-induced insulin release and stimulates growth hormone and prolactin secretion. Galanin has been implicated in several higher order physiological functions including cognition, feeding, nociception, mood regulation, and neuroendocrine modulation. The effects of galanin are mediated via three G protein-coupled receptors with different functional coupling. Moderate to low pharmacological effects are seen by galanin under physiological conditions, in contrast to its dramatic effects on the nervous system after neuronal disturbance. This pathophysiological heavy function of the galaninergic system renders it an interest for disorders such as AD, depression, and epilepsy in terms of side effects. Some properties of the galaninergic system are of particular importance in the context of neurodegeneration. Galanin is highly inducible, 10- to 100-fold, upon nerve injury, whereas most neuropeptides are induced 1.5- to 2-fold. Galanin is strongly neurotrophic during development as well as subsequent to injury. Whereas other neurotrophic neuropeptides like VIP and PACAP activate cAMP synthesis, galanin suppresses its synthesis, yet it is a strong neurotrophic as well as neuroprotective agent. As we delineate which galanin receptor subtype mediates neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects and which mediates synaptic inhibition, pharmacological use of receptor- selective galaninergic ligands for treatment in neurodegenerative diseases are coming closer.</AbstractText>"}

Overexpression of constitutively active CK1epsilon, one of the CK1 isoforms expressed in brain, leads to an increase in Abeta peptide production. Conversely, three structurally dissimilar CK1-specific inhibitors significantly reduced endogenous Abeta peptide production. By using mammalian cells expressing the beta C-terminal fragment of APP, it was possible to demonstrate that CK1 inhibitors act at the level of gamma-secretase cleavage.

We therefore, examined the effect of the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system on the viability of postnatal cerebellar granule neurones obtained from 8-day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Xanthine (100 microM) and xanthine oxidase (0.02 U/ml) applied for 1 or 6h reduced the viability of cells at 8 div assessed using the alamar blue assay, and induced morphological changes, such as shrinkage of the cell bodies and neurites. Heat-inactivation of xanthine oxidase resulted in complete loss of its activity. Superoxide dismutase (250 U/ml) failed to modify the damage by xanthine and xanthine oxidase, while catalase (250 U/ml) completely prevented it. When applied alone, xanthine oxidase significantly lowered cell viability, an effect that was blocked by allopurinol and catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. The results indicate that xanthine and xanthine oxidase can produce predominantly hydrogen peroxide instead of the superoxide anion.

Moreover, we show that NGF promoted a major neuronal survival than bFGF and GDNF, while bFGF and GDNF exerted an evidence axonal and dendritic outgrowth compared to NGF. In conclusion, these data suggest that OECs have the capacity to promote the survival and axonal outgrowth of hypothalamic neurons in vitro and that bFGF, NGF and GDNF differentially support hypothalamic neurons promoting and enhancing the neuronal survival and outgrowth. Therefore, the OECs are a source of growth factors and might be considered a better approach for functional recovery and growth factors might exert a neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

We confirmed that exposure to MPTP in mice leads to permanent behavioral deficits and depletion of dopamine and its metabolites. When administered prior to MPTP, echinacoside reduced behavioral deficits, increased striatal dopamine and dopamine metabolite levels, reduced cell death, and led to a marked increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression relative to mice treated with MPTP alone. In addition, pre-treatment with echinacoside significantly reduced caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons.

The investigation of the role of abnormal copper level in the development of neuropathological damage is essential for the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of these neurodegenerative disorders. Using a mouse model of perinatally induced copper deficiency, the present study analysed the response of neuronal and glial cells to copper deficiency from infancy to young adult age. In mice born and maintained after weaning on copper-deficient diet, copper measurements indicated that at 6-8 weeks the copper levels in the brain were decreased by about 80% with respect to controls. In the brain of copper-deficient mice, microglial and astrocytic activation was observed, mostly in the cerebral cortex and thalamus. In addition, small vacuolated globoid cells confined to the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus were found in the third postnatal week, and larger vacuolar profiles, identified as neuronal vacuoles, were observed in layer V of the cortex after the fourth week. The spatial distribution and temporal onset of vacuolation appeared to be unrelated to those of activated microglia and astrocytes. Nitrotyrosine-positivity was found to reflect the distribution of vacuoles in the cortex. The specific histopathological features here reported, as well as the severity of neurological deficits observed in this murine model of copper deficiency, strongly suggest that some hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders could be mediated by multifactorial pathogenetic mechanisms that include copper dysregulation.</AbstractText>"}

Proteases cleave PARs at specific sites within the extracellular amino-terminus to expose amino-terminal tethered ligand domains that bind to and activate the cleaved receptors. The proteases that activate PARs are often generated and released during injury and inflammation, and activated PARs orchestrate tissue responses to injury, including hemostasis, inflammation, pain, and repair. This review concerns protease and PAR signaling in the nervous system. Neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems express all four PARs. Proteases that may derive from the circulation, inflammatory cells, or neural tissues can cleave PARs on neurons and thereby activate diverse signaling pathways that control survival, morphology, release of neurotransmitters, and activity of ion channels. In this manner proteases and PARs regulate neurodegeneration, neurogenic inflammation, and pain transmission. Thus, PARs may participate in disease states and PAR antagonists or agonists may be useful therapies for certain disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Evidence has accumulated over the last few years suggesting that endocannabinoid-based drugs may potentially be useful to reduce the effects of neurodegeneration. In fact, exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids were shown to exert neuroprotection in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal injury via different mechanisms, such as prevention of excitotoxicity by cannabinoid CB1-mediated inhibition of glutamatergic transmission, reduction of calcium influx, anti-oxidant activity, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, induction of phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases and the expression of transcription factors and neurotrophins, lowering of cerebrovasoconstriction and induction of hypothermia. The release of endocannabinoids during neuronal injury may constitute a protective response. If this neuroprotective function of cannabinoid receptor activation can be transferred to the clinic, it might represent an interesting target to develop neuroprotective agents.</AbstractText>"}

Among the myriad of GPCRs expressed in neural cells, class II GPCRs which couples predominantly to the Gs-adenylate cyclase-cAMP signaling pathway, have recently received considerable attention for their involvement in regulating neuronal survival. Neuropeptides that activate class II GPCRs include secretin, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin-related peptides. Studies of patients and animal and cell culture models, have revealed possible roles for class II GPCRs signaling in the pathogenesis of several prominent neurodegenerative conditions including stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Many of the peptides that activate class II GPCRs promote neuron survival by increasing the resistance of the cells to oxidative, metabolic, and excitotoxic injury. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which class II GPCRs signaling modulates neuronal survival and plasticity will likely lead to novel therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

In our search for a prion-specific nucleic acid, we analyzed nucleic acids in purified fractions from the brains of Syrian hamsters infected with Sc237 prions. Purification of Sc237 prions removed nucleic acids larger than 50 nucleotides as measured by return refocusing electrophoresis (RRGE). To determine the size of the largest polynucleotide present in purified fractions at an abundance of one molecule per infectious (ID50) unit, we measured prions present after inoculation. In order to account for the rapid clearance of prions after intracerebral inoculation, we determined the number of PrP(Sc) molecules and ID50 units of prions that were retained in brain. Factoring in clearance after inoculation, we estimate that the largest polynucleotide present in our purified fractions at one molecule per ID50 unit is approximately 25 nucleotides in length. In the same fractions, there were approximately 3,000 protease-resistant PrP(Sc) molecules per ID50 unit after accounting for clearance of PrP(Sc) following inoculation. We compared the resistance of Sc237 and 139H prions to inactivation by UV irradiation at 254 nm. Irradiation of homogenates and microsomes diminished prion infectivity by a factor of approximately 1,000 but did not alter the strain-specified properties of the Sc237 and 139H prions. The data reported here combined with the production of synthetic prions argue that the 25-mer polynucleotides found in purified prion preparations are likely to be host encoded and of variable sequence; additionally, these 25-mers are unlikely to be prion specific.</AbstractText>"}

The O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzing O-GlcNAc addition is essential in mammals and mediates the last step in a nutrient-sensing 'hexosamine-signaling pathway.' This pathway may be deregulated in diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. To examine the function of O-GlcNAc in a genetically amenable organism, we describe a putative null allele of OGT in Caenorhabditis elegans that is viable and fertile. We demonstrate that, whereas nuclear pore proteins of the homozygous deletion strain are devoid of O-GlcNAc, nuclear transport of transcription factors appears normal. However, the OGT mutant exhibits striking metabolic changes manifested in a approximately 3-fold elevation in trehalose levels and glycogen stores with a concomitant approximately 3-fold decrease in triglycerides levels. In nematodes, a highly conserved insulin-like signaling cascade regulates macronutrient storage, longevity, and dauer formation. The OGT knockout suppresses dauer larvae formation induced by a temperature-sensitive allele of the insulin-like receptor gene daf-2. Our findings demonstrate that OGT modulates macronutrient storage and dauer formation in C. elegans, providing a unique genetic model for examining the role of O-GlcNAc in cellular signaling and insulin resistance.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we investigated the chronic effect of different antidepressants (fluoxetine, desipramine, and reboxetine) on the expression and function of the kinase in distinct subcellular compartments in order to dissect the different kinase pools affected. Acute treatments did not induce any change in the kinase. In total tissue extracts chronic drug treatments induced activation of the kinase; in hippocampus (HC), but not in prefrontal/frontal cortex, this was partially accounted for by increased Thr(286) phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms of activation. In synaptosomes, all drugs reduced the kinase phosphorylation, particularly in HC where, upon fractionation of the synaptosomal particulate into synaptic vesicles and membranes, we found that the drugs induced a redistribution and differential activation of the kinase between membranes and vesicles. Furthermore, a large decrease in the level and phosphorylation of synapsin I located at synaptic membranes was consistent with the observed decrease of CaM kinase II.

By means of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), it might be possible to ameliorate blunted responsiveness of degenerated neuronal circuits of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both. We evaluated the effect of 24-hour noisy GVS on long-term heart rate dynamics in 7 patients with multi system atrophy and on daytime trunk activity dynamics in 12 patients with either levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease or levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism. Six of the latter patients were also examined for cognitive performance by means of a continuous performance test. Short-range or high-frequency fluctuations of heart rate were significantly increased by the noisy GVS compared with sham stimulation, suggestive of improved autonomic, especially parasympathetic, responsiveness. Long-range antipersistency of trunk activity patterns probed by an autocorrelation measure was significantly increased by the noisy GVS, suggestive of quickening of bradykinesic rest-to-active transitions. The mean reaction time of the continuous performance test was also significantly decreased by the noisy GVS, without significant changes in either the omission or commission error ratios, which is suggestive of improved motor execution during the cognitive task. In conclusion, the noisy GVS is effective in boosting the neurodegenerative brains of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both, including those unresponsive to standard levodopa therapy; it is also effective in improving these patients' autonomic and motor responsiveness.</AbstractText>"}

Pharmacological blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate or activation of GABA(A) receptors, blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and oxygen induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration during the period of rapid brain growth in rodents. Because such measures are often necessary in critically ill infants and toddlers, search for adjunctive neuroprotective strategies is warranted. We report that 17beta-estradiol ameliorates neurotoxicity of drugs that block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, activate GABA(A) receptors, or block voltage-gated sodium channels and reduces neurotoxicity of oxygen in the infant rat brain. This neuroprotective effect is reversed by tamoxifen and cannot be reproduced by 17alpha-estradiol. 17Beta-estradiol did not affect GABA(A) or N-methyl-D-aspartate currents in hippocampal neuronal cultures, indicating that direct modulation of neurotransmitter receptor/channel properties by this compound cannot explain neuroprotective effect. 17beta-Estradiol did, however, increase levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT, suggesting that activation of these prosurvival proteins may represent one mechanism for its neuroprotective action. 17Beta-estradiol and related compounds may be neuroprotective agents suitable for use in critically ill infants and toddlers. Its supplementation may particularly help to improve neurocognitive outcome in preterm infants who are prematurely deprived of maternal estrogen.</AbstractText>"}

In the present study, we investigated whether defects in the mitochondrial respiratory function are consequences of the expression of mutant Htt or they promote the formation of Htt aggregates. To take advantage of existing mitochondrial DNA mutants, we developed human osteosarcoma 143B cells expressing mutant Htt in an inducible manner and found that cells expressing mutant Htt but not wild-type Htt exhibited a reduced activity of complex III and an increased activity of complex IV. Conversely, pharmacological treatments that inhibited complex III activity significantly promoted the formation of Htt aggregates. This complex III-mediated modulation of Htt aggregates was also observed in a neuronal progenitor RN33B cell line transduced by lentivirus carrying mutant Htt. This effect of complex III inhibition on the Htt aggregates appeared to be mediated by the inhibition of proteasome activity, but not by ATP depletion or production of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, complex III mutant cells also showed decreased proteasome activity. These results suggest the presence of a feedback system connecting the mitochondrial respiratory complex III and the production of Htt aggregates. Our results suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting complex III and/or proteasome could ameliorate the progress of HD.</AbstractText>"}

RBD typically affects men over the age of 50 years. Longitudinal follow-up has shown that the majority of individuals with RBD will eventually develop additional signs and symptoms of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, most notably one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy body disease, multiple system atrophy, or pure autonomic failure), often after a prolonged interval lasting more than 10 years. RBD is also a common manifestation of narcolepsy. RBD may be induced by medications, especially the tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors.

These diseases range from slowly progressive forms including hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), to the rapidly progressive disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There is clinical and genetic overlap among these MNDs, implicating shared pathogenic mechanisms. We recruited a large family with a MND that was previously described as juvenile ALS and distal HMN. We identified a novel MND/HMN locus on chromosome 7q34-q36 following a genome-wide scan for linkage in this family. The disease causing mutation maps to a 26.2 cM (12.3 Mb) interval flanked by D7S2513 and D7S637 on chromosome 7q34-q36. Recombinant haplotype analysis including unaffected individuals suggests that the refined candidate interval spans 14.3 cM (6.3 Mb) flanked by D7S2511 and D7S798. One gene in the candidate interval, CDK5, was selected for immediate mutation analysis based upon its known association with an ALS-like phenotype in mice however, no mutations were identified. Identification of genes causing familial MND will lead to a greater understanding of the biological basis of both familial and sporadic motor neuron degeneration including ALS.</AbstractText>"}

Methylamine occurs endogenously from amine catabolism and its tissue levels increase in some pathological conditions, including diabetes. Interestingly, methylamine and ammonia levels are reciprocally controlled by a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity that deaminates methylamine to formaldehyde with the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. As already described for ammonia, methylamine also targets the voltage-operated neuronal potassium channels, probably inducing release of neurotransmitter(s). From this interaction it has been observed that methylamine is 1) hypophagic in mice without producing amphetamine-like effects and 2) a stimulator of nitric oxide release from rat hypothalamus. Methylamine hypophagia is also maintained in genetically obese and diabetic mice and is increased when these animals are pre-treated with -amino guanidine, an inhibitor of methylamine oxidative deamination. The effect of -amino guanidine suggests a potential beneficial effect of this drug, and other such inhibitors, in controlling food intake in animals with disturbed eating behavior. Moreover, the activity of methylamine as an inducer of NO release suggests a role for the amine and for the enzymatic activity that degrades it in neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Stereoscopy and simulation studies focusing on smaller plaques suggested that vascular associations for both Tg2576 and PSAPP mice were dramatically higher than those encountered by chance alone. We further identified ultrastructural microvascular abnormalities occurring in association with dense plaques. Although occurrence of gross cerebral hemorrhage was infrequent, we identified considerable infiltration of the serum proteins immunoglobulin and albumin in association with dense plaques.

Approximately one-half of the neurons produced during neurogenesis die before completion of CNS maturation. To characterize the role of the inhibitor of apoptosis gene, survivin, during neurogenesis, we used the Cre-loxP-system to generate mice lacking survivin in neuronal precursor cells. Conditional deletion of survivin starting at embryonic day 10.5 leads to massive apoptosis of neuronal precursor cells in the CNS. Conditional mutants were born at the expected Mendelian ratios; however, these died shortly after birth from respiratory insufficiency, without primary cardiopulmonary pathology. Newborn conditional mutants showed a marked reduction in the size of the brain associated with severe, mutifocal apoptosis in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and retina. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in the mutant brains were significantly elevated, whereas bax expression was unchanged from controls. These results show that survivin is critically required for the survival of developing CNS neurons, and may impact on our understanding of neural repair, neural development, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our study is the first to solidify a role for survivin as an antiapoptotic protein during normal neuronal development in vivo.</AbstractText>"}

Many neurodegenerative disorders involve aberrant protein folding and protein damage, which accumulates in an age-dependent manner. Ageing is associated with the decrease in activity of the heat shock transcription factors (HSF) that regulate HSP gene transcription. Neuronal cells seem particularly vulnerable in this sense as HSF activity and HSP expression are relatively weak in such cells and motor neurons appear to require input of HSP secreted from adjacent glial cells to maintain adequate molecular chaperone levels. It may be significant that motor neurons have been shown to be the sensitive cells in the ageing of Drosophila and C. elegans and that these organisms may acquire extended lifespans with over-expression of small heat shock proteins and HSF1.

Distinguishing the two dementias based on volumetric measurements of brain atrophy with MRI has been only partially successful. Whether MRI measurements of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease and FTD is unclear. In this study, we measured cortical thickness using a set of automated tools (Freesurfer) to reconstruct the brain's cortical surface from T1-weighted structural MRI data in 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 19 patients with FTD and 23 cognitively normal subjects. The goals were to detect the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in these two types of dementia, to test the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive impairment, to determine if measurement of cortical thickness is better than that of cortical volume for differentiating between these dementias and normal ageing and improving the classification of Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone. Compared to cognitively normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner cortex primarily in bilateral, frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes (P &lt; 0.001), while FTD patients had a thinner cortex in bilateral, frontal and temporal regions and some thinning in inferior parietal regions and the posterior cingulate (P &lt; 0.001). Compared to FTD patients, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner cortex (P &lt; 0.001) in parts of bilateral parietal and precuneus regions. Cognitive impairment was negatively correlated with cortical thickness of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease, while similar correlations were not significant in FTD. Measurement of cortical thickness was similar to that of cortical volume in differentiating between normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and FTD. Furthermore, cortical thickness measurements significantly improved the classification between Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and a modified version of the Trail-Making Test. In conclusion, the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease and FTD suggest that cortical thickness may be a useful surrogate marker for these types of dementia.</AbstractText>"}

These misfolded species aggregate and form inclusion bodies and their neurotoxicity is associated with the aggregation. To handle a build-up of abnormal proteins cells employ a complicated machinery of molecular chaperones and various proteolytic systems. Chaperones facilitate refolding or degradation of misfolded polypeptides, prevent protein aggregation and play a role in formation of aggresome, a centrosome-associated body to which small cytoplasmic aggregates are transported. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system is critical for reducing the levels of soluble abnormal proteins, while autophagy plays the major role in clearing of cells from protein aggregates. Accumulation of the aggregation prone proteins activates signal transduction pathways that control cell death, including JNK pathway that controls viability of a cell in various models of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The major chaperone Hsp72 can interfere with this signalling pathway, thus promoting survival. A very important consequence of a build-up and aggregation of misfolded proteins is impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system and suppression of the heat shock response. Such an inhibition of the major cell defense systems may play a critical role in neurodegeneration. Here, it is suggested that these changes may reflect a senescence-like programme initiated by the aggregated abnormal polypeptides. Pathways that control the fate of misfolded proteins, for example molecular chaperones or proteolytic systems, may become interesting novel targets for therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

These results demonstrate the diversity of aging patterns present within the human brain, as well as how rapidly genome-wide patterns of aging can evolve between species; they may also have implications for the oxidative free radical theory of aging, and help to improve our understanding of human neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Although HD is a neurodegenerative disease, recent evidence indicates that neurological dysfunction, rather than frank neurodegeneration contributes to, and may even cause early symptoms in the absence of neurodegeneration. One protein that may contribute to neurological dysfunction in HD is complexin II. Complexins are presynaptic proteins that are believed to modulate neurotransmitter release. Complexin II levels are reduced in human HD striatum and cortex, and a progressive depletion of complexin II mRNA and protein has also been shown in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Interestingly, complexin II knockout mice share behavioural deficits in reversal learning in common with R6/2 mice. Further, the two strains both show abnormalities in long-term potentiation. This evidence led us to wonder whether or not loss of complexin II underlies some of the behavioural deficits seen in R6/2 mice. To investigate this, we crossbred complexin II knockout mice with R6/2 mice to generate a double mutant mouse. The behavioural phenotype of R6/2 mice on a null complexin II background was characterised and was compared to that seen in control mice. Complete knockout of complexin II did not significantly affect the phenotype of R6/2 mice. This indicates that loss of complexin II is part of the mechanism underlying the R6/2 phenotype. Whether it is causal or compensatory remains to be determined.</AbstractText>"}

The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin. Predictive genetic testing has revealed early cognitive deficits in asymptomatic gene carriers such as altered working memory, executive function and recognition memory. The perirhinal cortex is believed to process aspects of recognition memory. Evidence from primate studies suggests that decrements in neuronal firing within this cortical region encode recognition memory and that the underlying mechanism is an activity-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory neurotransmission, the converse of long-term potentiation (LTP). We have used the R6/1 mouse model of HD to assess synaptic plasticity in the perirhinal cortex. This mouse model provides an ideal tool for investigating early and progressive changes in synaptic function in HD. We report here that LTD at perirhinal synapses is markedly reduced in R6/1 mice. We also provide evidence to suggest that a reduction in dopamine D2 receptor signalling may be implicated.</AbstractText>"}

Our last studies showed that systemic injections of low doses of inhibitors of NO synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for NO formation, induce anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus maze whereas higher doses decrease maze exploration. Also, NOS inhibitors decrease locomotion and rearing in an open field arena. These results may involve motor effects of this compounds, since inhibitors of NOS, NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and 7-Nitroindazole (7-NIO), induced catalepsy in mice. This effect was also found in rats after systemic, intracebroventricular or intrastriatal administration. Acute administration of L-NOARG has an additive cataleptic effect with haloperidol, a dopamine D2 antagonist. The catalepsy is also potentiated by WAY 100135 (5-HT1a receptor antagonist), ketanserin (5HT2a and alfal adrenergic receptor antagonist), and ritanserin (5-HT2a and 5HT2c receptor antagonist). Atropine sulfate and biperiden, antimuscarinic drugs, block L-NOARG-induced catalepsy in mice. L-NOARG subchronic administration in mice induces rapid tolerance (3 days) to its cataleptic effects. It also produces cross-tolerance to haloperidol-induced catalepsy. After subchronic L-NOARG treatment there is an increase in the density NADPH-d positive neurons in the dorsal part of nucleus caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and tegmental pedunculupontinus nucleus. In contrast, this treatment decreases NADPH-d neuronal number in the substantia nigra compacta. Considering these results we suggest that (i) NO may modulate motor behavior, probably by interfering with dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the striatum; (ii) Subchronic NO synthesis inhibition induces plastic changes in NO-producing neurons in brain areas related to motor control and causes cross-tolerance to the cataleptic effect of haloperidol, raising the possibility that such treatments could decrease motor side effects associated with antipsychotic medications. Finally, recent studies using experimental Parkinson's disease models suggest an interaction between NO system and neurodegenerative processes in the nigrostriatal pathway. It provides evidence of a protective role of NO. Together, our results indicate that NO may be a key participant on physiological and pathophysiological processes in the nigrostriatal system.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is very difficult to predict from these results the effects of polyphenol intake on disease prevention in humans. One of the reasons is that these studies have often been conducted at doses or concentrations far beyond those documented in humans. The few clinical studies on biomarkers of oxidative stress, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and tumor or bone resorption biomarkers have often led to contradictory results. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown an inverse association between the risk of myocardial infarction and the consumption of tea and wine or the intake level of some particular flavonoids, but no clear associations have been found between cancer risk and polyphenol consumption.

H2O2 may damage cells through direct oxidation of lipids, proteins and DNA or it can act as a signaling molecule to trigger intracellular pathways leading to cell death. In this study, H2O2 caused plasma membranes of primary astrocytes to become more gel-like, while artificial membranes of vesicles composed of rat brain lipid extract became more liquid crystalline-like. Besides the effects on membrane phase properties, H2O2 promoted actin polymerization, induced the formation of cell-to-cell tunneling nanotube (TNT)-like connections among astrocytes and increased the colocalization of myosin Va with F-actin. Myosin Va was also observed in the H2O2-induced F-actin-enriched TNT-like connections. Western blot analysis suggests that H2O2 triggered the phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and that SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, suppressed the changes in membrane phase properties and cytoskeleton resulting from H2O2 treatment.

Furthermore, we investigated the effect of PNQX on muscle properties impaired by nerve crush. At the second postnatal day, the sciatic nerve of the rat left hind limb was crushed. Twenty-four rats were subsequently treated with PNQX and an equal number of rats, as control group, were treated with saline. PNQX was injected subcutaneously once daily (14 mg kg(-1) body weight). Treatment continued until the rats were 14 days old. Measurements were then carried out to assess the contractile properties of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), a fast-contracting muscle, and of the soleus muscle, a slow-contracting muscle, in four 'age groups' of rats, each consisting of six PNQX-treated and six control animals: (a) postnatal day (P) 14, (b) postnatal day (P) 21, (c) postnatal day (P) 28 and (d) adult rats. The following parameters were recorded: number of motor units, muscle weight, maximal tetanic tension (TET 100), time to peak (TTP), half relaxation time (HRT), and fatigue index (FI). Improvement in motor unit survival after nerve injury was observed in all age groups administering PNQX. Also axotomy-induced impairment of muscle properties such as muscle weight, tension development, contraction and relaxation velocity was counteracted by injection of PNQX. The fatigue index was altered by axotomy and mostly normalized by treatment with this compound.

In the ER, proteins fold into their native configuration and are modified by post-translational modifications. Perturbations that alter ER homeostasis therefore disrupt folding and lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins. These perturbations include modifications of Ca2+ homeostasis, increased demand for protein folding due to elevated synthesis of proteins in specialized cells or expression of a mutant misfolded protein. To limit accumulation of unfolded proteins, the cells have developed a specialized pathway : the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR involves the activation of three transmembrane proteins of the ER : the PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and the inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1). The activation of all three components of the UPR depends on the dissociation of the luminal chaperone BiP/GRP78 from the luminal part of these proteins. Once activated, these pathways down-regulate protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of eiF2 (eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2) and up-regulate the transcription of genes which encode ER chaperones, protein folding enzymes and components of the ER-associated degradation system (ERAD). Growing evidences indicate that UPR signaling plays critical roles in nutrient sensing, differentiation of secretory cells such as pancreatic b cell and antibody producing plasma cells, glucose homeostasis and in the development of pathologies linked to accumulation of aggregated proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies have shown an enhanced expression of PBR in the regenerating sciatic nerve, suggesting that this protein may be involved in the regenerative response. The rat sciatic nerve suffers important structural alterations with aging, including alterations in the morphology of myelin sheaths and a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers. In this study, we have assessed the effect of two PBR ligands, Ro5-4864 and PK-11195, to determine whether PBR may influence aging-associated morphological changes in the sciatic nerve. The treatment of 23-month-old, Sprague-Dawley male rats for 1 month with Ro5-4864 significantly reduced the percentage of fibers with myelin decompaction and increased the total number of myelinated fibers. In contrast, PK-11195, a PBR ligand that binds to a different site than Ro5-4864 in the PBR molecule, did not significantly affect any of the parameters analyzed. These findings support the potential role of PBR ligands to prevent aging-associated peripheral nerve degeneration.</AbstractText>"}

However, the temporal relationship between glial cell activation and nigral cell death is relatively unexplored. Consequently, the effects of acute (24 h) and chronic (30 days) glial cell activation induced by unilateral supranigral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration were studied in rats. At 24 h, LPS administration caused a marked reduction in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) but striatal TH-ir was unaffected. By 30 days, the loss of TH-positive neurons in the LPS-treated nigra was no greater than at 24 h although a heterogeneous loss of striatal TH-ir was present. The loss of nigrostriatal neurons was of functional significance, as at 30 days, LPS-treated rats exhibited ipsiversive circling in response to (+)-amphetamine administration. At 24 h, there was a moderate increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-ir astrocytes in the SN but a marked elevation of p47phox positive OX-42-ir microglia, and intense inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-ir and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT)-ir was present. However, by 30 days the morphology of OX-42-ir microglia returned to a resting state, the numbers were greatly reduced and no 3-NT-ir was present. At 30 days, GFAP-ir astrocytes were markedly increased in number and iNOS-ir was present in fibrillar astrocyte-like cells. This study shows that acute glial activation leading to dopaminergic neuron degeneration is an acute short-lasting response that does not itself perpetuate cell death or lead to prolonged microglial activation.</AbstractText>"}

Increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has recently been emphasized as an important pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ALS. To investigate the effects of G93A or A4V mutations on the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt and GSK-3 pathway as well as the caspase-3 pathway, VSC4.1 motoneuron cells were transfected with G93A- or A4V-mutant types of hSOD1 (G93A and A4V cells, respectively) and, 24 h after neuronal differentiation, their viability and intracellular signals, including PI3-K/Akt, GSK-3, heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSTF-1), cytochrome c, caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were compared with those of wild type (wild cells). Furthermore, to elucidate the role of the GSK-3beta-mediated cell death mechanism, alterations of viability and intracellular signals in those mutant motoneurons were investigated after treating the cells with GSK-3beta inhibitor. Compared with wild cells, viability was greatly reduced in the G93A and A4V cells. However, the treatment of G93A and A4V cells with GSK-3beta inhibitor increased their viability by activating HSTF-1 and by reducing cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. However, the treatment did not affect the expression of PI3-K/Akt and GSK-3beta. These results suggest that the G93A or A4V mutations inhibit PI3-K/Akt and activate GSK-3beta and caspase-3, thus becoming vulnerable to oxidative stress, and that the GSK-3beta-mediated cell death mechanism is important in G93A and A4V cell death.</AbstractText>"}

There is evidence that impaired energy metabolism contributes to neuronal death in HD. Creatine is an endogenous substrate for creatine kinases and thereby supports cellular ATP levels. This study investigated the effects of creatine supplementation (5 mm) on cell survival and neuronal differentiation in striatal cultures. Chronic creatine treatment resulted in significant increased densities of GABA-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons, although total neuronal cell number and general viability were not affected. Similar effects were seen after short-term treatment, suggesting that creatine acted as a differentiation factor. Inhibitors of transcription or translation did not abolish the creatine-mediated effects, nor did omission of extracellular calcium, whereas inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase significantly attenuated the creatine induced increase in GABA-ir cell densities. Creatine exhibited significant neuroprotection against toxicity instigated either by glucose- and serum deprivation or addition of 3-nitropropionic acid. In sum, the neuroprotective properties in combination with promotion of neuronal differentiation suggest that creatine has potential as a therapeutic drug in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, like HD.</AbstractText>"}

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the predominant non-lysosomal protein degradation pathway that ensures the viability, proliferation and signaling of eukaryotic organisms. Overwhelming data exist implicating a critical role for the UPS in cerebral ischemic injury. Ischemic and hypoxic trauma, and their associated oxidative, nitrosylative and energetic stress, underlie neurodegeneration following stroke, and evoke a discreet set of transcriptional events which have a complex and interdependent relationship with proteasomal function. Rapid elimination of denatured, misfolded and damaged proteins by the proteasome becomes a critical determinant of cell fate. Proof-of-principle has been obtained from animal models of cerebral ischemia, in which proteasome inhibitors reduce neuronal and astrocytic degeneration, cortical infarct volume, infarct neutrophil infiltration. and nuclear factor kappaB immunoreactivity. This neuroprotective efficacy has also been observed when proteasome inhibitors have been used 6 h after ischemic insult. Strategies aimed at effecting long-lasting changes in proteasomal function are not recommended, given the growing body of evidence implicating long-term proteasomal dysfunction in chronic neurodegenerative disease. These effects are likely due to the fact that the UPS is also essential for cellular growth, metabolism and repair, and untoward effects of proteasomal inhibition indicate that the development of short-lived proteasome inhibitors, or compounds which can spatially and temporally regulate the UPS, is a desirable clinical target. Studies in animal models indicate that the use of specific proteasome inhibitors may be beneficial in treating a host of acute neurological disorders, including ischemic stroke.</AbstractText>"}

Inflammation protects the brain from infection, but it aggravates injury. Furthermore, brain inflammation is considered a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Emerging evidence supports the activation of negative regulatory mechanisms during this process to prevent prolonged and extensive inflammation. The inflammatory stimulators themselves or products of inflammatory cells may induce the expression of negative feedback regulators, such as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-family proteins, antioxidant enzymes, and antiinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, death of activated microglia (major inflammatory cells in the brain) may regulate brain inflammation. Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, may also act in preventing microglial overactivation. Therefore, we propose that the extent and duration of brain inflammation is tightly regulated through the cooperation of multiple mechanisms to maximize antipathogenic effects and minimize tissue damage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Currently, a comprehensive assessment of EAE pathogenesis with respect to inflammatory and degenerating neuronal elements is lacking. By using Fluoro-jade histochemistry to mark neurodegeneration and dual immunostaining to follow T-cell, microglial, and vascular responses, the time course and distribution of pathological events in EAE was surveyed. C57BL/6J mice were killed at 7, 10, 14, 21 or 35 days after vaccination with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide MOG(35-55). Disease onset occurred at day 14 and peaked at day 21. Early T-cell infiltration and microglial activation in periventricular and superficial white matter structures adjacent to meninges suggested initial recruitment of effector T cells via the cerebrospinal fluid and choroid plexus. This was associated with microglial activation at distal sites along the same white matter tracts, with subsequent vascular recruitment of T cells associated with further injury. Systematic examination of the entire CNS supported this two-step model of EAE pathogenesis, with inflammation and neurodegeneration commencing at similar times and affecting multiple levels of predominantly sensory central pathways, including their terminal fields. This included aspects of the visual, auditory/vestibular, somatosensory (lemniscal), and proprioceptive (spinocerebellar) systems. The early targeting of visual and periventricular structures followed by more widespread CNS involvement is consistent with common presenting signs in human MS patients and suggestive of a similar basis in neuropathology.</AbstractText>"}

However, activation of the DNA repair system, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1), is thought to cause neuronal death through NAD+ depletion and mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)) depolarization. Here, we show that abolishing PARP-1 activity in primary cortical neurons can either enhance or prevent apoptotic death, depending on the intensity of an oxidative stress. Only in severe oxidative stress does PARP-1 activation result in NAD+ and ATP depletion and neuronal death. To investigate the role of PARP-1 in an endogenous model of oxidative stress, we used an RNA interference (RNAi) strategy to specifically knock down glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis. GCL RNAi spontaneously elicited a mild type of oxidative stress that was enough to stimulate PARP-1 in a Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II-dependent manner. GCL RNAi-mediated PARP-1 activation facilitated DNA repair, although neurons underwent delta psi(m) loss followed by some apoptotic death. PARP-1 inhibition did not prevent delta psi(m) loss, but enhanced the vulnerability of neurons to apoptosis upon GCL silencing. Conversely, mild expression of PARP-1 partially prevented to GCL RNAi-dependent apoptosis. Thus, in the mild progressive damage likely occur in neurodegenerative diseases, PARP-1 activation plays a neuroprotective role that should be taken into account when considering therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>"}

Hcy competes with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A/B receptors and behave like an excitatory neurotransmitter. GABA stimulates the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA-A/B receptor and decreases arterial blood pressure. However, the neural mechanisms of microvascular remodeling in hyperhomocysteinemia are unclear. This review addresses the idea that Hcy induces microvascular permeability by attenuating the GABA-A/B receptors and increasing redox stress, which activates a disintegrin and metalloproteinase that suppresses tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase. This process causes disruption of the matrix in the blood-brain barrier.

Affymetrix and Amersham Biosciences oligonucleotide microarrays were used to analyze global gene expression in blood samples of HD patients and matched controls. We identified 322 mRNAs that showed significantly altered expression in HD blood samples, compared with controls (P &lt; 0.0005), on two different microarray platforms. A subset of up-regulated mRNAs selected from this group was able to distinguish controls, presymptomatic individuals carrying the HD mutation, and symptomatic HD patients. In addition, early presymptomatic subjects showed gene expression profiles similar to those of controls, whereas late presymptomatic subjects showed altered expression that resembled that of symptomatic HD patients. These elevated mRNAs were significantly reduced in HD patients involved in a dose-finding study of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium phenylbutyrate. Furthermore, expression of the marker genes was significantly up-regulated in postmortem HD caudate, suggesting that alterations in blood mRNAs may reflect disease mechanisms observed in HD brain. In conclusion, we identified changes in blood mRNAs that clearly distinguish HD patients from controls.

Fifty-six autopsied subjects were identified with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and two serial head MRI. Subjects were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive changes (FTLD-U), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-five controls were matched by age, gender and scan interval, to the study cohort. The boundary-shift integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain (BBSI) and ventricular volume (VBSI). All BSI results were annualized by adjusting for scan interval. The rates of whole brain atrophy and ventricular expansion were significantly increased compared to controls in the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, FTLD-U, CBD and PSP groups. However, atrophy rates in the DLB group were not significantly different from control rates of atrophy. The largest rates of atrophy were observed in the CBD group which had a BBSI of 2.3% and VBSI of 16.2%. The CBD group had significantly greater rates of BBSI and VBSI than the DLB, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, Alzheimer's disease and PSP groups, with a similar trend observed when compared to the FTLD-U group. The FTLD-U group showed the next largest rates with a BBSI of 1.7% and VBSI of 9.6% which were both significantly greater than the DLB group. There was no significant difference in the rates of atrophy between the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and PSP groups, which all showed similar rates of atrophy; BBSI of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.0% and VBSI of 8.3, 7.2 and 10.9%, respectively. Rates of atrophy therefore differ according to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein biochemistry. While rates are unlikely to be useful in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from cases with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB pathology, they demonstrate important pathophysiological differences between DLB and those with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and between those with CBD and PSP pathology.</AbstractText>"}

Important insight into the mechanisms of axon degeneration arose from findings that the degeneration of transected axons is delayed in Wallerian degeneration slow (Wlds) mice with the overexpression of a fusion protein with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetic enzyme, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat1). Although both Wld(s) and Nmnat1 themselves are functional in preventing axon degeneration in neuronal cultures, the underlying mechanism for Nmnat1- and NAD-mediated axon protection remains largely unclear. We demonstrate that NAD levels decrease in degenerating axons and that preventing this axonal NAD decline efficiently protects axons from degeneration. In support of a local protective mechanism, we show that the degeneration of axonal segments that have been separated from their soma could be prevented by the exogenous application of NAD or its precursor nicotinamide. Furthermore, we provide evidence that such Nmnat1/NAD-mediated protection is primarily mediated by their effects on local bioenergetics. Together, our results suggest a novel molecular pathway for axon degeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Many mitogenic factors, including neurotransmitters and growth factors, activate PLD in neurons and astrocytes. Activation of PLD downstream of protein kinase C seems to be a required step for astroglial proliferation. The characteristic disruption of the PLD signaling pathway by ethanol probably contributes to the delay of brain growth in fetal alcohol syndrome. The post-natal increase of PLD activities concurs with synapto- and myelinogenesis in the brain and PLD is apparently involved in neurite formation. In the adult and aging brain, PLD activity has antiapoptotic properties suppressing ceramide formation. Increased PLD activities in acute and chronic neurodegeneration as well as in inflammatory processes are evidently due to astrogliosis and may be associated with protective responses of tissue repair and remodeling. ARF-regulated PLD participates in receptor endocytosis as well as in exocytosis of neurotransmitters where PLD seems to favor vesicle fusion by modifications of the shape and charge of lipid membranes. Finally, PLD activities contribute free choline for the synthesis of acetylcholine in the brain. Novel tools such as RNA interference should help to further elucidate the roles of PLD isoforms in brain physiology and pathology.</AbstractText>"}

In these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and the whole protein is deposited. In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in amyloid precursor protein or in the presenilins cause autosomal dominant disease. These are the substrate and proteases responsible for the production of the deposited peptide Abeta. Thus, in all the cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process. Furthermore, sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed by genetic variability at the same loci, implying that the quantity of the normal protein influences the risk of this form of disease. These results show that the amount of pathogenic protein expression is a key factor in determining disease initiation. Recent work on transgenic models of these diseases is consistent with the view that there are two stages of pathogenesis: a concentration-dependent formation of a pathogenic protein oligomer followed by aggregation on to this oligomeric template by a process that is less dependent on the concentration of the protein.</AbstractText>"}

We acquired spectra at two distinct time points in two independent groups of six rats and analyzed metabolite levels using either creatine or water as a reference. Our results provide evidence that CT-PRESS at 3T is adequate and reliable for in vivo detection and quantification of glutamate in the rat brain and that regional differences occur in the signal intensities of the major metabolites.

Regulation of the processing or turnover of these proteins represents potential targets for the development of AD therapies. Sumoylation is a process by which SUMOs (small ubiquitin-like modifiers) are covalently conjugated to target proteins, resulting in a number of functional consequences. These include regulation of protein-protein interactions, intracellular trafficking and protein stability, which all have the potential to impact on several aspects of the amyloidogenic pathway. The present study examines the effects of overexpression and knockdown of the major SUMO isoforms (SUMO1, 2 and 3) on APP processing and the production of Abeta peptides. SUMO3 overexpression significantly increased Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion, which was accompanied by an increase in full-length APP and its C-terminal fragments. These effects of SUMO3 were independent of its covalent attachment or chain formation, as mutants lacking the motifs responsible for SUMO chain formation or SUMO conjugation led to similar changes in Abeta. SUMO3 overexpression also up-regulated the expression of the transmembrane protease BACE (beta-amyloid-cleaving enzyme), but failed to affect levels of several other unrelated proteins. Suppression of SUMO1 or combined SUMO2+3 by RNA interference did not affect APP levels or Abeta production. These findings confirm a specific effect of SUMO3 overexpression on APP processing and the production of Abeta peptides but also suggest that endogenous sumoylation is not essential and likely plays an indirect role in modulating the amyloid processing pathway.</AbstractText>"}

Analysis of reaction time courses performed in the presence of anionic fibrillization inducers revealed that increasing concentrations of N744 decreased the total filament length without modulating lag time, indicating that filament extension but not nucleation was affected by inhibitor under the conditions that were investigated. Critical concentration measurements confirmed that N744 shifted equilibria at filament ends away from the fibrillized state, resulting in endwise filament disaggregation when it was added to synthetic filaments. Both increasing bulk tau concentrations and filament stabilizing modifications such as pseudophosphorylation and glycation antagonized N744 activity.

The present work examines mGluRI expression and signaling in the frontal cortex (area 8) of 3 cases with Pick disease (PiD), a neurodegenerative disease with abnormal phospho-tau accumulation, in comparison with 3 age-matched controls by means of glutamate binding assays, enzymatic activity, gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, solubility and immunoprecipitation assays, and confocal microscopy. Reduced expression levels of PLCbeta1 and reduced PLCbeta1 activity have been found in PiD. The expression levels of the nonrelated phospholipase PLCgamma, a substrate of tyrosine kinase, are also reduced in PiD. This is accompanied by a marked decrease in the expression of cPKCalpha and increased expression of the inner band (76 kDa) of the nPKCdelta doublet at the expense of a decrease of the phosphorylated (active) form (78 kDa). In contrast, L-[3H]glutamate-specific binding to mGluRs is augmented in PiD cases, mainly because of the higher mGluR1 and mGluRs expression levels detected. No modifications in PLCbeta1 solubility have been observed in PiD and no interactions between PLCbeta1 and tau have been demonstrated in diseased and control cases. Moreover, double-labeling immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy have shown no colocalization of phospho-tau (AT8 antibody) and PLCbeta1 in phospho-tau inclusions, including Pick bodies.

CAA is also a frequent concomitant of Alzheimer disease (AD). While the longterm consequences of CAA are well recognized from clinical and pathologic studies, numerous questions remain unanswered regarding the progression of the disease. Examination of CAA in traditional histologic sections does not easily allow for characterization of CAA, particularly in leptomeningeal vessels. In order to approach this topic, we used low magnification imaging of intact, postmortem brains from transgenic mouse models of AD-like pathology to define the spatial and temporal characteristics of CAA in leptomeningeal vessels. Imaging of brains from 10- to 26-month-old animals demonstrated a stereotypical pattern to the development of CAA, with vessels over the dorsal surface of the brain showing an anterior-to-posterior and large-to-small vessel gradient of involvement. High magnification imaging revealed that CAA deposition began with a banding pattern determined by the organization of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Further analysis of the pattern of amyloid deposits showed shrinkage and disappearance of the gaps between clusters of amyloid bands, gradually reaching a confluent pattern. These data led to a classification system to describe the severity of CAA deposition and demonstrate the potential of using intact brains to generate maps defining the progression and kinetics of CAA. This approach should lead to more informed analysis of the consequences of evolving therapeutic options for AD on this related form of vascular pathology.</AbstractText>"}

In this model, mutant ATXN7T accumulated in neuronal intranuclear inclusions containing ubiquitin, the 19S proteasome subunit, and HSP70 (heat shock protein 70), as in patients. Aggregation was accompanied by a decrease in locomotion and lifespan but limited neuronal death. Disaggregation of the inclusions, when expression of expanded ATXN7T was stopped, correlated with improved locomotor function and increased lifespan, suggesting that the pathology may respond to treatment. Lifespan was then used as a quantitative marker in a candidate gene approach to validate the interest of the model and to identify generic modulators of polyQ toxicity and specific modifiers of SCA7. Several molecular pathways identified in this focused screen (proteasome function, unfolded protein stress, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and histone acetylation) were further studied in primary neuronal cultures. Sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, improved the survival time of the neurons.

Here, we show that oxidation of calmodulin results in an inability to: (1) activate CaMKII; (2) support Thr(286) autophosphorylation of CaMKII; (3) prevent Thr(305/6) autophosphorylation of CaMKII; (4) support binding of CaMKII to the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor; and (5) compete with alpha-actinin for binding to CaMKII.

These observations contrast from past experiments performed with oxidized calmodulin and the plasma membrane calcium ATPase, where oxidized calmodulin binds to, and partially activates the PMCA.

We took advantage of the 1C11 neuroectodermal cell line, endowed with the capacity to selectively differentiate into serotonergic (1C11(5-HT)) or noradrenergic (1C11(NE)) neurons, to identify functional targets of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) and norepinephrine (NE) autoreceptors possibly involved in the control of neuronal functions. We demonstrate that 5-HT(2B) and adreno alpha(1D) receptors are coupled to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through NADPH oxidase activation in 1C11(5-HT) and 1C11(NE) neuronal cells, respectively. In the signaling cascade linking 5-HT(2B) receptors to NADPH oxidase, phospholipase A2-mediated arachidonic acid production is required for ROS synthesis. ROS, in turn, act as second message signals and control the activation of TACE (TNF-alpha converting enzyme), a member of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family. 5-HT(2B) and alpha(1D) receptor stimulation triggers TACE-dependent TNF-alpha shedding in the surrounding milieu of 1C11(5-HT) and 1C11(NE) cells. In these cells, shed TNF-alpha triggers degradation of 5-HT and NE into 5-HIAA and MHPG, respectively. Finally, we observe that 5-HT(2B) and alpha(1D) receptor couplings to the NADPH oxidase-TACE cascade are strictly restricted to 1C11-derived progenies that have implemented a complete neuronal phenotype. Altogether, our data indicate that couplings of 5-HT(2B) and alpha(1D) autoreceptors to ROS and TNF-alpha signaling control neurotransmitter metabolism in 1C11-derived neuronal cells. Eventually, we might explain the origin of oxidative stress and high level of TNF-alpha in neurodegenerative diseases as a consequence of deviation of normal signaling pathways coupled to neurotransmitters.</AbstractText>"}

Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (RCAN1 or DSCR1) is a dose-sensitive gene whose overexpression has been linked to Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and to the response of cells to stress stimuli. Here, we show that RCAN1 mRNA and protein expression are sensitive to OS in primary neurons, and we evaluate the involvement of RCAN1 dosage in neuronal death induced by OS. We find that Rcan1(-/-) neurons display an increased resistance to damage by H(2)O(2), which can be reverted by RCAN1 overexpression or by exogenous inhibitors of calcineurin. Although increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration is an important factor in OS-mediated cell death, our results show that Ca(2+) loading after exposure to H(2)O(2) was similar in Rcan1(+/+) and Rcan1(-/-) neurons. Our data further suggest that CaN and NFAT signaling protect against OS in both Rcan1(+/+) and Rcan1(-/-) neurons. To explain the observed differential vulnerability, we therefore propose a mechanism downstream of H(2)O(2)-mediated Ca(2+) entry, involving calcineurin-NFAT signaling. These findings highlight the importance of RCAN1 gene dosage in the modulation of cell survival and death pathways and suggest that changes in the amount of RCAN1 could represent an important mechanism for regulating susceptibility to neurodegeneration, especially in DS and AD.</AbstractText>"}

Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging studies of both types of tissue are discussed. Herein, normal-appearing white matter abnormalities are being found in quantitative magnetic resonance investigations, consistent with a limited degree of axonal damage and/or demyelination, and an increase of glial cells, but the specific nature of the histopathological changes underlying the quantitative magnetic resonance abnormalities remains unclear. Gray matter studies have demonstrated that much of the disease process remains undetected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging. Although newly developed techniques, such as 3D double-inversion recovery, may greatly improve detection of cortical pathology, it remains important to investigate the resultant effects on the cortical tissue alongside this, by studying integrity of normal-appearing cortical tissue through quantitative magnetic resonance studies, as well as the net neurodegenerative effect through measurements of cortical thickness and cortical atrophy (rates). To improve our understanding of normal-appearing white and gray matter changes, their mutual relations, and their relations to clinical changes, further in vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies are required. Specifically, it is proposed that more spatially specific investigations, ideally utilizing subject-specific anatomical information from, for example, diffusion fiber-tracking techniques, could be used to gain more insight into the relations between normal-appearing white matter changes, cortical changes, magnetic resonance visible focal-lesions, and physical and cognitive deficits.</AbstractText>"}

We analyzed 303 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 71 AD, 32 DLB and 36 FTD patients in comparison to 93 various other dementias (OD), 20 peripheral neurologic disease (PND) controls, 25 neurodegenerative disorders without dementia (ND) and 26 depressive cognitive complainers (DCC) for distinct CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide patterns, using the quantitative Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. Additionally, the novel electrochemiluminescence technique (MSD) was used to validate the measures on Abeta1-38. The main outcome measures were a striking decrease of Abeta1-42 in AD (P=7.4 x 10(-19)), and most interestingly a pronounced decrease of Abeta1-38 in FTD (P=9.6 x 10(-7)). Moreover, a novel peptide that most probably represents an oxidized alpha-helical form of Abeta1-40 (Abeta1-40(ox)) displayed a highly significant increase in DLB (P=3.7 x 10(-3)) as compared to non-demented disease controls. The overall diagnostic accuracy of percentage Abeta peptide abundances (Abeta1-X%) was clearly superior to absolute CSF Abeta levels. Abeta1-42% and Abeta1-38% enabled contrasts of 85% or beyond to distinguish AD and FTD, respectively, from all other investigated subjects. Abeta1-40(ox)% yielded a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 73% for the detection of DLB among all other investigated patients. We found a strong correlation between Abeta1-38 levels as measured by the Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot and MSD, respectively. CSF Abeta peptides may reflect disease-specific impact of distinct neurodegenerative processes on Abeta peptide metabolism and represent a potential diagnostic biomarker for AD, FTD and DLB.</AbstractText>"}

In the former group, idiopathic PD patients, the causes of the illness have been the subject of longstanding debate with environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal protein handling and oxidative stress being suggested. One problem has been that the epidemiology of PD has offered few clues to provide evidence for a single major causative factor. Comparatively recently it has been found that in both patients and experimental models of PD in animals neuroinflammation appears to be a ubiquitous finding. These cases present with all of the classical features of inflammation including phagocyte activation, increased synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines and complement activation. Although this process is vital for normal function and protection in both the CNS, as in the periphery, it is postulated that in the aetiology of PD this process may spiral out of control with over activation of microglia, over production of cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators as well as the release of destructive molecules such as reactive oxygen species. Given that dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are relatively vulnerable to 'stress' and the region has a large population of microglia in comparison to other CNS structures, these events may easily trigger neurodegeneration. These factors are examined in this review along with a consideration of the possible use of anti-inflammatory drugs in PD.</AbstractText>"}

Proteins with pyrin and/or caspase recruitment domains have roles in apoptosis, innate immunity, and inflammation. Many pyrin domain (PYD) proteins modulate NF-kappaB activity as well as participate in assembling both the perinuclear 'apoptotic speck' and the pro-IL1beta/IL-18-converting inflammasome complex. 'Pyrin-only' proteins (POP) are attractive as negative regulators of PYD-mediated functions and one such protein, POP1, has been reported. We report the identification and initial characterization of a second POP. POP2 is a 294 nt single exon gene located on human chromosome 3 encoding a 97-aa protein with sequence and predicted structural similarity to other PYDs. Highly similar to PYDs in CATERPILLER (CLR, NLR, NALP) family proteins, POP2 is less like the prototypic pyrin and ASC PYDs. POP2 is expressed principally in peripheral blood leukocytes and displays both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression patterns in transfected cells. TNF-alpha-stimulated and p65 (RelA)-induced NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription is inhibited by POP2 in vitro by a mechanism involving changes in NF-kappaB nuclear import or distribution. While colocalizing with ASC in perinuclear specks, POP2 also inhibits the formation of specks by the CLR protein CIAS1/NALP3. Together, these observations demonstrate that POP2 is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB activity that may influence the assembly of PYD-dependent complexes.</AbstractText>"}

Neurodegenerative disorders that involve neuroinflammation such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV-associated dementia are commonly associated with local upregulation and release of chemokines. However, recent work has established that certain chemokines, constitutively expressed in the brain, exert functions in the brain that are distinct from inflammation. These chemokines regulate neuronal migration during brain development, modulate neuronal activity and play a role in various neurodegenerative diseases, pain and more recently in neuroendocrine functions.

One such disease is glaucoma, a chronic neurodegenerative condition of the eye that targets and stimulates apoptosis of CNS neurons called retinal ganglion cells. Since ganglion cell death is intrinsic, it is reasonable that the genes that control this process may contribute to the complex genetics that affect ganglion cell susceptibility to disease. To determine if genetic background influences susceptibility to optic nerve damage, leading to ganglion cell death, we performed optic nerve crush on 15 different inbred lines of mice and measured ganglion cell loss. Resistant and susceptible strains were used in a reciprocal breeding strategy to examine the inheritance pattern of the resistance phenotype.

CD spectral analysis and immunostaining with conformation-dependent antibodies indicated that tau may undergo conformational changes during fibril formation. Enriched granules generated filaments, suggesting that granular tau aggregates may be an intermediate form of tau fibrils. The amount of granular tau aggregates was elevated in prefrontal cortex of Braak stage I cases compared to that of Braak stage 0 cases, suggesting that granular tau aggregation precedes PHF formation. Thus, granular tau aggregates may be a relevant marker for the early diagnosis of tauopathy. Reducing the level of these aggregates may be a promising therapy for tauopathies and for promoting healthy brain aging.</AbstractText>"}

Laforin, a protein phosphatase, and malin, an ubiquitin ligase, are two of the proteins that are known to be defective in LD. Malin interacts with laforin and promotes its polyubiquitination and degradation. Here we show that malin and laforin co-localize in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that they form centrosomal aggregates when treated with proteasomal inhibitors in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Laforin/malin aggregates co-localize with gamma-tubulin and cause redistribution of alpha-tubulin. These aggregates are also immunoreactive to ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ER chaperone and proteasome subunits, demonstrating their aggresome-like properties. Furthermore, we show that the centrosomal aggregation of laforin and malin is dependent on the functional microtubule network. Laforin and malin form aggresome when expressed together or otherwise, suggesting that the two proteins are recruited to the centrosome independent of each other. Taken together, our results suggest that the centrosomal accumulation of malin, possibly with the help of laforin, may enhance the ubiquitination of its substrates and facilitate their efficient degradation by proteasome. Defects in malin or laforin may thus lead to increased levels of misfolded and/or target proteins, which may eventually affect the physiological processes of the neuron. Thus, defects in protein degradation and clearance are likely to be the primary trigger in the physiopathology of LD.</AbstractText>"}

Intrahippocampally administered SAP diffuses from the site of injection to the cortical and subcortical area of the rat brain and enters the cells of brain tissue in 1 week. It induces elevation of the number of in situ TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end-labeled nuclei in the hippocampus, cortex and subcortical structures of rat central nervous system. DNA fragmentation, which is detected by the end labeling reaction, is characteristic to apoptosis. It develops in 4 weeks following exposure. Apoptosis is an important form of cell death in different neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Our present work reveals that apoptosis can be induced by SAP beyond other hitherto known apoptosis inducing components of neurodegeneration.

Increased levels of plasma homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) - which may result from a deficiency of folate, vitamin B6 or B12 or mutations in enzymes regulating the catabolism of homocysteine - are associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, mostly affecting the central nervous system (e.g., mental retardation, cerebral atrophy and epileptic seizures). Recent evidence suggests that changes in the metabolic fate of homocysteine, leading to hyperhomocysteinemia, may also play a role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). The nervous system might be particularly sensitive to homocysteine, due to the excitotoxic-like properties of the amino acid. However, experimental findings have shown that homocysteine does not seem to posses direct, cytotoxic activity, while the amino acid has proven able to synergize with more specific neurotoxic insults. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been repeatedly reported in PD patients; the increase, however, seems mostly related to the methylated catabolism of l-Dopa, the main pharmacological treatment of PD. Therefore, hyperhomocysteinemia may not be specific to movement disorders or other neurological diseases, the condition being, in fact, rather the result of the combinations of different factors, mainly metabolic, but also genetic and pharmacological, intervening in the neurodegenerative process.</AbstractText>"}

One mechanism by which cells defend themselves against oxidative stress is through the transcriptional upregulation of cytoprotective genes. Under oxidative stress conditions, the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) to induce antioxidant and phase II detoxification enzymes. Here we show that loss of Nrf2-mediated transcription exacerbates vulnerability to the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway by the known chemical inducer tert-butylhydroquinone can protect against 6-OHDA in vitro. Induction of this pathway by transplantation of astrocytes overexpressing Nrf2 can protect against 6-OHDA-induced damage in the living mouse.

These findings suggest a need for direct central nervous system approaches in such patients. To begin to evaluate an aggressive but potentially useful new strategy for metabolic improvement of this disorder, we studied the acute and chronic effects of CuHis administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection in healthy adult rats. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after ICV CuHis showed diffuse T(1)-signal enhancement, indicating wide brain distribution of copper after ICV administration, and implying the utility of this paramagnetic metal as a MRI contrast agent. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CuHis, defined as the highest dose that did not induce overt toxicity, growth retardation, or reduce lifespan, was 0.5mcg. Animals receiving multiple infusions of this MTD showed increased brain copper concentrations, but no significant differences in activity, behavior, and somatic growth, or brain histology compared to saline-injected controls. Based on estimates of the brain copper deficit in Menkes disease patients, CuHis doses 10-fold lower than the MTD found in this study may restore proper brain copper concentration. Our results suggest that ICV CuHis administration have potential as a novel treatment approach in Menkes disease infants with severe mutations.

To determine aging affects on DeltaPsi(m) and ROS production in individual somal and axonal/dendritic mitochondria, we compared ROS production while simultaneously monitoring DeltaPsi(m) before and after glutamate treatment of live neurons from embryonic (day 18), middle-aged (9-12 months), and old (24 months) rats. At rest, old neuronal mitochondria 1) showed a higher rate of ROS production that was particularly strong in axonal/dendritic mitochondria relative to that in middle-age neurons, 2) were more depolarized in comparison with neurons of other ages, and 3) showed no differences in ROS or DeltaPsi(m) as a function of distance from the nucleus. All DeltaPsi(m) grouped into three classes of high (less than -120 mV), medium (-85 to -120 mV), and low (greater than -85 mV) polarization that shifted toward the lower classes with age at rest. Glutamate exposure dramatically depolarized the DeltaPsi(m) in parallel with greatly increased ROS production, with a surprising absence of an effect of age or distance from the nucleus on these mitochondrial parameters.

Following exposure to the infectious agent (PrP(Sc)) in acquired disease, infection is propagated in lymphoid tissues prior to neuroinvasion and spread within the central nervous system. The mechanism of prion dissemination is perplexing due to the lack of plausible PrP(Sc)-containing mobile cells that could account for prion spread between infected and uninfected tissues. Evidence exists to demonstrate that the culture media of prion-infected neuronal cells contain PrP(Sc) and infectivity but the nature of the infectivity remains unknown. In this study we have identified PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) in association with endogenously expressing PrP neuronal cell-derived exosomes. The exosomes from our prion-infected neuronal cell line were efficient initiators of prion propagation in uninfected recipient cells and to non-neuronal cells. Moreover, our neuronal cell line was susceptible to infection by non-neuronal cell-derived exosome PrP(Sc). Importantly, these exosomes produced prion disease when inoculated into mice. Exosome-associated PrP is packaged via a novel processing pathway that involves the N-terminal modification of PrP and selection of distinct PrP glycoforms for incorporation into these vesicles. These data extend our understanding of the relationship between PrP and exosomes by showing that exosomes can establish infection in both neighbouring and distant cell types and highlight the potential contribution of differentially processed forms of PrP in disease distribution. These data suggest that exosomes represent a potent pool of prion infectivity and provide a mechanism for studying prion spread and PrP processing in cells endogenously expressing PrP.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2007 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Three genes have been identified causing earlier onset AD, and a fourth has been shown to be a risk factor for late onset AD (LOAD), while many more yet unrecognized genes are thought to contribute to susceptibility. Many studies have reported linkage to LOAD on human chromosome 10, where we have identified a parent of origin effect [Bassett SS, Avramopoulos D, Perry RT, Wiener H, Watson B Jr, Go RC, Fallin MD. Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 141:537-540, (2006), Bassett SS, Avramopoulos D, Fallin D. Am J Med Genet 114:679-686, (2002)]. In this paper, we report on a gene in this region that shows reduced expression with increasing age, reduced expression in females across ages, and further reduction in LOAD patients. In concordance with the observed parent of origin effect on the linkage, this reduction is more pronounced in patients with an affected mother. We discovered this gene while studying the alkaline ceramidase gene (ASAH2); it is a partial paralog of ASAH2, and we call it ASAH2L. It is the result of a partial duplication of ASAH2 on chromosome 10q11.23, just downstream from the sequence with promoter activity. ASAH2L has a polymorphic start codon with a single nucleotide change of the original ASAH2 sequence plus other putative translation start sites that might produce novel proteins. It is expressed in all the tissues we tested including the brain and is an interesting example of the generation of a new gene. Comparison of primate and other mammal genomes suggests that ASAH2L is human specific. Further research would be necessary to determine the function of the ASAH2L transcript and explore any possible involvement in neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

However, cultured neurons show signs of cell death after 2 or 3 weeks. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been elucidated, several preventive methods have been identified. Here we show that the neuronal loss in primary cortical culture involves calpain activation and subsequent neuronal cell death. Neuronal loss during cultivation showed destruction of neurites and synapses, and a decrease in neuron numbers. mu-Calpain and m-calpain were initially activated and accumulated by increased RNA expression. This neuronal death exhibited neurodegenerative features, such as conversion of p35 to p25, which is important in the developmental process and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. But, postnatal and aged rat cortex did not show calpain activation and prolonged processing of p35 to p25, in contrast to the long-term culture of cortical neurons. In addition, the inhibition of calpains by ALLM or ALLN blocked the conversion of p35 to p25, indicating that the calpain activity is essential for the neurodegenerative features of cell death. Taken together, this study shows that the neuronal loss in primary cortical cultures involves neurodegeneration-like cell death through the activation of calpains and the subsequent processing of p35 to p25, but not developmental apoptosis or aging. Our results suggest that the long term primary culture of cortical neurons represent a valuable model of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Thus, accumulation of faulty proteins due to a compromised Msr system may lead to the development of aging-associated diseases like neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, it was interesting to monitor the consequential effects of methionine oxidation in relation to markers that are associated with Alzheimer's disease as methionine oxidation was implied to play a role in beta-amyloid toxicity. In this study, a knockout mouse strain of the methionine sulfoxide reductase A gene (MsrA ( -/- )) caused an enhanced neurodegeneration in brain hippocampus relative to its wild-type control mouse brain. Additionally, a loss of astrocytes integrity, elevated levels of beta-amyloid deposition, and tau phosphorylation were dominant in various regions of the MsrA ( -/- ) hippocampus but not in the wild-type. Also, a comparison between cultured brain slices of the hippocampal region of both mouse strains showed more sensitivity of the MsrA ( -/- ) cultured cells to H(2)O(2) treatment.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a hyperphosphorylated form of the protein tau (p-tau) forms intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles. Deposits of p-tau have also been found in the brains of patients with Down's syndrome, supranuclear palsy, and prion disease. Mutations in tau have been causally associated with at least one inherited neurologic disorder, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), implying that tau abnormalities by themselves can be a primary cause of degenerative diseases of the CNS. Removal of these p-tau species may occur by both chaperone-mediated refolding and degradation. In this issue of the JCI, Dickey and colleagues show that a cochaperone protein, carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), in a complex with Hsp90 plays an important role in the removal of p-tau (see the related article beginning on page 648).

These aggregates entangle other denatured proteins and lipids to form disease-specific inclusion bodies. The failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to shred the protein aggregates has led investigators to focus their attention to autophagy, a bulk degradative system coupled with lysosomes, which is involved in non-selective shredding of large amounts of cytoplasmic components. Research in this field has demonstrated the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and intracytoplasmic protein aggregates in patients with various neurodegenerative diseases. Although autophagy fails to degrade large protein aggregates once they are formed in the cytoplasm, drug-induced activation of autophagy is effective in preventing aggregate deposition, indicating that autophagy significantly contributes to the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins. The pivotal role of autophagy in the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins has been confirmed by a deductive approach using a brain-specific autophagy-ablated mouse model. In this review, we discuss the consequences of autophagy deficiency in neurons.</AbstractText>"}

We used a 3T clinical MR scanner equipped with an insert gradient coil that yields an order of magnitude increase in performance over the whole-body hardware to acquire in vivo DTI images of rat brain. The resolution allowed for fiber tracking evaluation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficients in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. A comparison of short (46 min) and long (92 min) acquisition time DTI protocols indicated low but adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=6.2) of the shorter protocol to conduct quantitative fiber tracking enhanced by multiple acquisitions. As observed in human studies, FA in the rat splenium was higher than in the genu. Advantages of this technology include the use of similar user interface, pulse sequences, and field strength for preclinical animal and clinical human research, enhancing translational capabilities. An additional benefit of scanning at lower field strength, such as 3 T, is the reduction of artifacts due to main field inhomogeneity relative to higher field animal systems.</AbstractText>"}

It is now well established that early glycation products undergo progressive modification over time in vivo to the formation of irreversible cross-links, after which these molecules are termed 'AGEs (advanced glycation end products)'. AGEs have been implicated in the development of many of the pathological sequelae of diabetes and aging, such as diabetic microangiopathy, ischemic heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, digested food-derived AGEs are also found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AGE-related disorders. Diet is a major environmental source of pro-inflammatory AGEs. Indeed, restriction of dietary glycotoxins decreases excessive AGE levels and subsequently reduces the inflammatory responses in patients with diabetes. These observations suggest that inhibition of absorption of dietary AGEs may be a novel target for therapeutic intervention in the above-mentioned AGE-related disorders. AST-120 (Kremezin) is an oral adsorbent that attenuates the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) by removing uremic toxins. We have recently found that AST-120 binds to carboxymethyllysine (CML), one of the well-characterized, digested food-derived AGEs in vitro and that administration of AST-120 decreases serum levels of AGEs in non-diabetic CRF patients. These findings suggest that digested food-derived AGEs such as CML may be a novel molecular target for oral adsorbent AST-120 and that AST-120 could exert beneficial effects on CRF patients by adsorbing diet-derived AGEs and subsequently decreasing serum AGE levels. If our speculation is correct, AST-120 may have therapeutic potentials for the treatment of patients with various AGE-related disorders as well. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypotheses. Does the long-term treatment of AST-120 decrease serum and tissue levels of AGEs in diabetic patients? Does this treatment also reduce the risk for the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy or ischemic heart disease? If the answers are yes, do the serum and/or tissue levels of AGEs after AST-120 treatment predict its beneficial effects on diabetic vascular complications? How about the effects of AST-120 on Alzheimer's disease, another AGE-related neurodegenerative disorder? Does the treatment of AST-120 reduce the risk for Alzheimer's disease and/or improve the cognitive impairment of patients with this disorder?

It is removed from the extracellular medium by high-affinity transporters, dependent on the maintenance of the Na(+) gradient through the activity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPases. Failure of glutamate clearance can lead to neuronal damage, named excitotoxic damage, due to the prolonged activation of glutamate receptors. Severe impairment of glycolytic metabolism during ischemia and hypoglycemia, leads to glutamate transport dysfunction inducing the elevation of extracellular glutamate and aspartate, and neuronal damage. Altered glucose metabolism has also been associated with some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's, and a role of excitotoxicity in the neuropathology of these disorders has been raised. Alterations in glutamate transporters and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been observed in these patients, suggesting altered glutamatergic neurotransmission. We hypothesize that inhibition of glucose metabolism might induce changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission rendering neurons more vulnerable to excitotoxicity. We have previously reported that sustained glycolysis impairment in vivo induced by inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), facilitates glutamate-mediated neuronal damage. We have now investigated whether this facilitating effect involves altered glutamate uptake, and/or NMDA receptors in the rat hippocampus in vivo. Results indicate that metabolic inhibition leads to the progressive elevation of extracellular glutamate and aspartate levels in the hippocampus, which correlates with decreased content of the GLT-1 glutamate transporter and diminished glutamate uptake. In addition, we observed increased Tyr(1472) phosphorylation and protein content of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor.

The aim of the present work was to verify whether A(2A)R-mediated effects are altered in the striatum of transgenic HD (R6/2) versus wild-type (WT) mice. Extracellular field potentials (FPs) were recorded in corticostriatal slices from R6/2 mice in early (7-8 weeks) or frankly (12-13 weeks) symptomatic phases, and age-matched WT. In 12-13 weeks aged WT animals, the application of 75 microM NMDA induced a transient disappearance of the FP followed by an almost complete recovery at washout. In slices from HD mice, the mean FP recovery was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01 versus WT). A(2A)R activation oppositely modulated NMDA-induced toxicity in the striatum of HD versus WT mice. Indeed, the A(2A)R agonist CGS21680 reduced the FP recovery in slices from WT mice, while it significantly increased it in slices from R6/2 mice. In early symptomatic (7-8 weeks) mice, no differences were observed between WT and HD animals in terms of basal synaptic transmission and response to NMDA. At the same age, the behavioural effects elicited by CGS21680 were qualitatively identical in WT and HD mice.

They severely affect eye, motor and cognitive functions and, in most cases, abbreviate the lifespan. Postmitotic cells such as neurons and mononuclear phagocytes rich in lysosomes are most often affected by the accumulation of undegraded material. Cell death is well documented in parts of the brain and in other cells of LSD patients and animal models, although little is known about mechanisms by which death pathways are activated in these diseases, and not all cells exhibiting increased storage material are affected by cell death. Lysosomes are essential for maturation and completion of autophagy-initiated protein and organelle degradation. Moreover, accumulation of effete mitochondria has been documented in postmitotic cells whose lysosomal function is suppressed or in aging cells with lipofuscin accumulation. Based upon observations in the literature and our own data showing similar mitochondrial abnormalities in several LSDs, we propose a new model of cell death in LSDs. We suggest that the lysosomal deficiencies in LSDs inhibit autophagic maturation, leading to a condition of autophagic stress.

Prion replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, neuronal dysfunction, and apoptosis. In this study we analyze the effect of perturbations in ER homeostasis on PrP biochemical properties and prion replication. ER stress led to the generation of a mis-folded PrP isoform, which is detergent-insoluble and protease-sensitive. To understand the mechanism by which ER stress generates PrP misfolding, we assessed the contribution of different signaling pathways implicated in the unfolded protein response. Expression of a dominant negative form of IRE1 alpha or XBP-1 significantly increased PrP aggregation, whereas overexpression of ATF4 or an active mutant form of XBP-1 and ATF6 had the opposite affect. Analysis of prion replication in vitro revealed that the PrP isoform generated after ER stress is more efficiently converted into PrP(Sc) compared with the protein extracted from untreated cells. These findings indicate that ER-damaged cells might be more susceptible to prion replication. Because PrP(Sc) induces ER stress, our data point to a vicious cycle accelerating prion replication, which may explain the rapid progression of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":17329034,"Title":"A novel pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin on advanced glycation end product (AGE)-related disorders.","Journal":"Medical hypotheses","Date":"2007","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Reducing sugars can react non-enzymatically with the amino groups of proteins to form reversible Schiff bases, and then Amadori products. These early glycation products undergo further complex reactions such as rearrangement, dehydration and condensation to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives termed 'advanced glycation end products' (AGEs). The pathological role of the non-enzymatic glycation of proteins has become increasingly evident in various types of disorders such as diabetic vascular complications, neurodegenerative diseases, and melanoma growth and metastasis. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that RAGE is a signal-transducing receptor for AGEs and that engagement of RAGE with AGEs evokes oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, thereby being involved in the AGE-related disorders. We have recently found that atorvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent decreases serum levels of AGEs in type 2 diabetic patients in a cholesterol-lowering independent manner. Further, we have shown that atorvastain blocks the AGE-signaling to C-reactive protein (CRP) expression in human hepatoma cells in vitro via anti-oxidative properties. These observations led us to speculate that atorvastatin could be a promising remedy for treating patients with AGE-related disorders. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypotheses. (1) Does atorvastatin treatment reduce the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications with normocholesterolemic patients? If the answer is yes, is this beneficial effect of atorvastatin superior to that of other cholesterol-lowering agents with equihypolipidemic properties? (2) Are these beneficial effects of atorvastain attributed to its AGE-lowing properties? Does the blockade by atorvastain of the AGE signaling pathway, in other words, the suppression of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and CRP levels by atorvastatin treatment, contribute to its cardioprotective properties? (3) Does the treatment with atorvastatin decrease the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and/or prolong the survival of these patients? (4) How about the effects of atorvastatin on the incidence of malignant melanoma? These prospective studies will provide further valuable information whether the blockade by atorvastatin of the AGE formation or the AGE-downstream signaling could be clinically relevant.</AbstractText>"}

While, the construction of transgenic mouse models of human neurological diseases has created a great need for developing mouse analogs of this or other types of human memory tasks, only a few studies exist in rodents, and more specifically in mice. The present study is aimed at examining a SRT protocol for mice using our new operant chamber designed to be polyvalent for different experimental conditions and uses. We provide data for learning by normal C57BL/6 mice of a repeating sequence of 12 nose poke responses, first, via the observation of increases in reaction times when repeated sequence is replaced by random sequence, and, second, by analysis of behavior during transfer trials in which one sequential element is discretely replaced by a new item. The potential of our protocol for dissecting the different neural systems of learning and memory is discussed as well as its usefulness for the validation of transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

During aging, and particularly in neurodegenerative disorders, cellular Ca2+-regulating systems are compromised resulting in synaptic dysfunction, impaired plasticity and neuronal degeneration. Oxidative stress, perturbed energy metabolism and aggregation of disease-related proteins (amyloid beta-peptide, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin, etc.) adversely affect Ca2+ homeostasis by mechanisms that have been elucidated recently. Alterations of Ca2+-regulating proteins in the plasma membrane (ligand- and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, ion-motive ATPases, and glucose and glutamate transporters), endoplasmic reticulum (presenilin-1, Herp, and ryanodine and inositol triphosphate receptors), and mitochondria (electron transport chain proteins, Bcl-2 family members, and uncoupling proteins) are implicated in age-related neuronal dysfunction and disease. The adverse effects of aging on neuronal Ca2+ regulation are subject to modification by genetic (mutations in presenilins, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin, or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase; apolipoprotein E isotype, etc.) and environmental (dietary energy intake, exercise, exposure to toxins, etc.) factors that may cause or affect the risk of neurodegenerative disease. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote or prevent disturbances in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis during aging may lead to novel approaches for therapeutic intervention in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and stroke.</AbstractText>"}

These considerations were the impetus for a workshop, sponsored by the Geriatrics Research Branch in the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development of the National Institute of Mental Health that was held on September 7-8, 2005. The primary goal of the workshop was to bring together investigators in geriatric psychiatry research with researchers in specific topic areas outside of geriatric mental health to identify priority areas to advance translational research in geriatric depression. As described in this report, the workshop focused on a discussion of the development and application of integrative approaches combining genetics and neuroimaging methods to understand such complex issues as treatment response variability, the role of medical comorbidity in depression, and the potential overlap between depression and dementia. Future directions for integrative research were identified. Understanding the nature of geriatric depression requires the application of translational research and interdisciplinary research approaches. Geriatric depression could serve as a model for translational research integrating basic and clinical neuroscience approaches that would have implications for the study of other neuropsychiatric disorders.</AbstractText>"}

This review focuses on stem and/or progenitor cells in the brain that drive adult neurogenesis in mammals. Neuronal precursor cells are found in two regions of the adult brain: the subventricular zone and the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone has implications for behavior and olfactory function and, in the hippocampus, is involved in mood, learning and memory. Several neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease) are increasing in frequency as the population is aging. Understanding the hormonal aspects of how adult neurogenesis is regulated could lead to advances in understanding, managing and eventually, treating neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the influence of hormones on adult neurogenesis. Many hormones that act through nuclear receptors are implicated in regulating neural progenitor cell biology. Given that nuclear receptors are well defined, drugable targets, further research on their mechanisms of action in adult neurogenesis are likely to engender new replacement, repair and therapeutic approaches.</AbstractText>"}

To search for potential therapeutic agents against neurodegenerative diseases, different subclasses of flavonoids were analyzed and compared with estrogen. First, the estrogenic activities of these flavonoids were determined by activating the estrogen-responsive elements in cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Second, the neuroprotective effects of flavonoids were revealed by measuring its inhibition effects on the formation of reactive oxygen species, the aggregation of beta-amyloid, and the induction of cell death by beta-amyloid in cultured neuronal PC12 cells.

SCA1 pathogenesis studies support a model in which the expanded glutamine tract causes toxicity by modulating the normal activities of ATXN1. To explore native interactions that modify the toxicity of ATXN1, we generated a targeted duplication of the mouse ataxin-1-like (Atxn1l, also known as Boat) locus, a highly conserved paralog of SCA1, and tested the role of this protein in SCA1 pathology. Using a knock-in mouse model of SCA1 that recapitulates the selective neurodegeneration seen in affected individuals, we found that elevated Atxn1l levels suppress neuropathology by displacing mutant Atxn1 from its native complex with Capicua (CIC). Our results provide genetic evidence that the selective neuropathology of SCA1 arises from modulation of a core functional activity of ATXN1, and they underscore the importance of studying the paralogs of genes mutated in neurodegenerative diseases to gain insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

The atypical cadherin and G-protein-coupled receptor Flamingo and its orthologs in amphibians and mammals have been shown to regulate cell polarity, dendritic and axonal growth, and neural tube closure. However, the role of Flamingo in synapse formation and function and in axonal health remains poorly understood. Here we show that fmi mutations cause a significant increase in the number of ectopic synapses on muscles and result in the formation of novel en passant synapses along axons, and unique presynaptic varicosities, including active zones, within axons. The fmi mutations also cause defective synaptic responses in a small subset of muscles, an age-dependent loss of muscle innervation and a drastic degeneration of axons in 3rd instar larvae without an apparent loss of neurons. Neuronal expression of Flamingo rescues all of these synaptic and axonal defects and larval lethality. Based on these observations, we propose that Flamingo is required in neurons for synaptic target selection, synaptogenesis, the survival of axons and synapses, and adult viability. These findings shed new light on a possible role for Flamingo in progressive neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

These results validate LCM as a reliable technique for in vivo genomic studies in the brain hippocampus, where contamination by surrounding areas (not expressing Ras-GRF1) increases background noise and impairs identification of differentially expressed genes. Comparison between wild type and knockout LCM hippocampus samples revealed that Ras-GRF1 elimination caused significant gene expression changes, mostly affecting signal transduction and related neural processes. The list of 36 most differentially expressed genes included loci concerned mainly with Ras/G protein signaling and cytoskeletal organization (i.e. 14-3-3gamma/zeta, Kcnj6, Clasp2) or related, cross-talking pathways (i.e. jag2, decorin, strap).

As a toxic by-product of lipid peroxidation, acrolein has been implicated as a possible mediator of oxidative damage to cells and tissues in a wide variety of disease states, including atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative and pulmonary diseases. Although acrolein can induce apoptotic cell death in various cell types, the biochemical mechanisms are not understood. This study investigates the implication of the death receptor pathway in acrolein-induced apoptosis. Exposure of Chinese hamster ovary cells to acrolein caused translocation of adaptor protein Fas associated with death domain to the cytoplasmic membrane and caspase-8 activation. Kp7-6, an antagonist of Fas receptor activation, blocked apoptotic events downstream of caspase-8, such as caspase-7 activation and nuclear chromatin condensation. Acrolein activated the cross-talk pathway between the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Bid was cleaved to truncated-Bid, which was translocated to mitochondria. Activation of the mitochondrial pathway by acrolein was confirmed by caspase-9 activation. Inhibition of activation of either the Fas receptor or caspase-8 partially decreased acrolein-induced caspase-9 activation. These findings indicate that acrolein activates the Fas receptor pathway, which occurs upstream of the mitochondrial pathway. Caspase-9 activation still occurred despite inhibition of the Fas receptor pathway, suggesting that acrolein could also trigger the mitochondrial pathway independent of the receptor pathway. These findings improve our understanding of mechanisms of toxicity of the reactive aldehyde acrolein, which has widespread implications in multiple disease states which seem to be mediated by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.</AbstractText>"}

Three cases in the UK demonstrated that vCJD can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Since BSE and vCJD have spread to several countries outside the UK, it appears advisable that specific risk assessments be carried out in different countries and geographic areas. This review explains the approach adopted by Germany in assessing the risk and considering precautionary measures. A fundamental premise is that the feeding chain of cattle and the food chain have been successfully and permanently cleared from contaminated material. This raises the question of whether transmissions via blood transfusions could have the potential to perpetuate vCJD in mankind. A model calculation based on actual population data showed, however, that this would not be the case.

ApoE protein levels were low in the absence of apoptosis but increased by 8-fold when apoptosis was induced. Analysis of cellular debris that accumulated in the culture supernatants indicated that apoE levels became progressively concentrated in apoptotic bodies.

In this study the appearance of ChP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 57 AD and 21 VD patients and in 47 controls (CG) as well as the influence of ChP on the levels of tau protein and Abeta42 were investigated. The frequency of ChP occurrence in the AD patient group (43.9%) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group (10.6%). In the case of VD patients, 9.5% of this group was positive for ChP. The presence of ChP DNA in the CSF of patients with AD significantly increases the occurrence of this disease (odds ratio = 7.21). Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels were significantly lower in patients with AD than in the CG (p &lt; 0.001). Cerebrospinal tau protein was significantly higher in AD vs. CG (p = 0.007). However, no relationships between the presence of the bacterium in CSF and the level of either tau or Abeta42 protein were observed. In conclusion, we may suspect that testing for the presence of ChP in CSF, along with the tau and Abeta42 markers, may be used in the clinic diagnosis of AD.</AbstractText>"}

These methods have been applied to examine monoaminergic and cholinergic changes in neurodegenerative disorders. These investigations have provided important insights into disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The most intensely studied monoaminergic transmitter is dopamine. The extent of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation can be quantified in PD and may serve as a diagnostic biomarker. Dopaminergic receptor imaging may help to distinguish idiopathic PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders. Cholinergic denervation has been identified not only in AD but also in PD and more severely in parkinsonian dementia. PET or SPECT can also provide biomarkers to follow progression of disease or evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions. Cholinergic receptor imaging is expected to play a major role in new drug development for dementing disorders.</AbstractText>"}

The in vivo techniques are useful for the visualization of major changes, and the progressing abnormalities may also be followed longitudinally. However, to study and quantify minor abnormalities, neuroimaging of postmortem brain tissue is used. These in vitro methods are complementary to the in vivo techniques and contribute to the knowledge of pathophysiology and etiology of the neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro radioligand autoradiography has given great insight in the involvement of different neuronal receptor systems in these diseases. Data on the dopamine and cholinergic systems in neurodegeneration are discussed in this review. Also, the amyloid plaques are studied using in vitro radioligand autoradiography. Using one of the newer methods, imaging matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, the distribution of a large number of peptides and proteins may be detected in vitro on brain cryosections. In this overview, we describe in vitro imaging techniques in the neurodegenerative diseases as a complement to in vivo positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography imaging.</AbstractText>"}

A recently established quantitative urea-based Abeta-sodium-dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis with western immunoblot (Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot) revealed a highly conserved Abeta peptide (Abeta1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 1-42) pattern in CSF. We asked whether the variation might be useful to further elucidate the overlap between or distinctions among neurodegenerative diseases in Abeta-processing. We used the Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot to investigate CSF for disease-specific Abeta peptide patterns. CSF samples from 96 patients with mainly clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (n = 15), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 20), corticobasal degeneration (n = 12), Parkinson's disease (n = 11), multiple systems atrophy (n = 18), and dementia with Lewy-bodies (n = 20) were analysed as well a comparison group (n = 19). The Abeta peptide patterns varied between tauopathies and synucleinopathies and between all diseases and the comparison group, possibly due to the influence of tau and alpha-synuclein on Abeta-processing.</AbstractText>"}

Expansion of these polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences is the underlying cause of several neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Huntington's disease). Eukaryotic proteasomes have been found to digest polyQ sequences in proteins very slowly, or not at all, and to release such potentially toxic sequences for degradation by other peptidases. To identify these key peptidases, we investigated the degradation in cell extracts of model Q-rich fluorescent substrates and peptides containing 10-30 Q's. Their degradation at neutral pH was due to a single aminopeptidase, the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA, cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase). No other known cytosolic aminopeptidase or endopeptidase was found to digest these polyQ peptides. Although tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) exhibited limited activity, studies with specific inhibitors, pure enzymes and extracts of cells treated with siRNA for TPPII or PSA showed PSA to be the rate-limiting activity against polyQ peptides up to 30 residues long. (PSA digests such Q sequences, shorter ones and typical (non-repeating) peptides at similar rates.) Thus, PSA, which is induced in neurons expressing mutant huntingtin, appears critical in preventing the accumulation of polyQ peptides in normal cells, and its activity may influence susceptibility to polyQ diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Either mutations or deletions in the survival of motoneuron (SMN) gene are responsible for this defect. SMN is an assembly protein for RNA-protein complexes in the nucleus and is also found in axons of neurons. However, it is unclear which dysfunctions of SMN are important for disease progression. In this study we analyzed the contributions of different SMN regions for localization and neuronal differentiation associated with outgrowth of neurites. Suppression of endogenous SMN protein levels significantly decreased the growth of neurites. Down-regulation of the interacting protein gemin2 had the opposite effect. Surprisingly, selective overexpression of the SMN C-terminal domain promoted neurite outgrowth similar to full-length protein and could rescue the SMN knock-down effects. The knock-down led to a significant change in the G-/F-actin ratio, indicating a role for SMN in actin dynamics. Therefore, our data suggest a functional role for SMN in microfilament metabolism in axons of motoneurons.</AbstractText>"}

However, methods of the treatment seem to slow rather than treat the disease. One method is the use of Lorenzo's oil in conjunction with a low fat diet, which may help in cerebral X-ALD. X-ALD is in very close resemblance to another neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). One of the believed pathomechanisms of ALS is oxidative stress; therefore, this article's emphasis on the role of reactive oxygen species in X-ALD. The aim of the present study was to review the literature concerning the advances in the treatment of X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD, OMIM # 300100) in the last two decades and to shed more light on the link between oxidative stress and X-ALD. This review article may point to a deficit in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and/or ROS overproduction being involved in the aetiopathology of these neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, one of the useful neuronal rescue strategies could be the treatment with antioxidant agents.</AbstractText>"}

The circadian clocks are intrinsic time-tracking systems with which organisms can anticipate environmental changes and adapt to the appropriate time of day. In mammals, circadian rhythms are generated in pacemaker neurons within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), a small area of the hypothalamus, and are entrained by environmental cues, principally light. Disruption of these rhythms can profoundly influence human health, being linked to depression, insomnia, jet lag, coronary heart disease and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. It is now well established that circadian clocks operate via transcriptional feedback autoregulatory loops that involve the products of circadian clock genes. Furthermore, peripheral tissues also contain independent clocks, whose oscillatory function is orchestrated by the SCN. The complex program of gene expression that characterizes circadian physiology involves dynamic changes in chromatin transitions. These remodeling events are therefore of great importance to ensure the proper timing and extent of circadian regulation. How signaling influences chromatin remodeling through histone modifications is therefore highly relevant in the context of circadian oscillation. Recent advances in the field have revealed unexpected links between circadian regulators, chromatin remodeling and cellular metabolism.</AbstractText>"}

Microglia are involved in AD pathogenesis by promoting Abeta plaque formation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, phagocytosis of Abeta by activated microglia may prevent Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity and Abeta plaque formation. Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative models as well as human chronic neurological disorders. Minocycline attenuates the release of TNF-alpha by human microglia upon exposure to a mixture of Abeta, SAP and C1q. Here, we demonstrate that minocycline down-regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by human microglia without affecting their beneficial activity, phagocytosis of amyloid beta fibrils.</AbstractText>"}

Neurons exposed to AGEs undergo oxidative stress, but the molecular mechanisms able to induce ROS generation and cell death are not yet clear. In this work, we exposed SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to glycated albumin, as a model of AGE-modified protein, and we observed that cells differentiated by retinoic acid died after AGE exposure, through anion superoxide and peroxide generation, while undifferentiated cells resulted resistant. Retinoic acid induced marked increase in p47phox expression and in catalytic activity of PKC delta: the upregulation of a pathway involving NADPH oxidase and PKC delta is likely to be responsible for neuronal susceptibility to AGE. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that pre-treatments of differentiated cells with DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, or with rottlerin, an inhibitor of PKC delta, were able to prevent AGE-induced neuronal death.</AbstractText>"}

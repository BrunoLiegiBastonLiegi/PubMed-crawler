An endothelial cell-specific PCR array was used to screen the functional properties of EVs. Profiling of global microRNA expression was conducted in EVs. The expression level and biological function of microRNA-1 (miR-1) was determined by quantitative PCR, immunoblot and reporter gene assays, respectively. The in vivo effect of miR-1 on atherogenesis was investigated in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice administered with a miR-1-specific inhibitor, antagomiR-1.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>Steatotic hepatocytes released more EVs, which had significantly altered miRNA expression profiles compared to the EVs released by control hepatocytes. Endothelial cells co-cultured with steatotic hepatocytes, or treated with their EVs or miR-1, expressed significantly more proinflammatory molecules, as well as exhibiting increased NF-κB activity and reduced Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression. EV-induced endothelial inflammation was prevented by either downregulation or inhibition of miR-1. While miR-1 treatment suppressed KLF4 expression and reporter gene activity, overexpression of KLF4 dramatically abolished the miR-1-induced endothelial inflammation. Moreover, not only did the miR-1 inhibitor reduce endothelial inflammation in vitro, but it also attenuated atherogenesis in ApoE-deficient mice.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Steatotic hepatocyte-derived EVs promote endothelial inflammation and facilitate atherogenesis by miR-1 delivery, KLF4 suppression and NF-κB activation.

Herein, we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles, released by hepatocytes under NAFLD conditions, cause vascular endothelial inflammation and promote atherosclerosis. Within these toxic vesicles, we identified a small molecular cargo that acted as a potent inducer of endothelial inflammation. By inhibiting this cargo's function, a specific gene-based inhibitor profoundly attenuated atherogenesis in mice, uncovering a novel mechanism which may be used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Oridonin (Ori) is an active terpenoid, which has been reported to rescue synaptic loss and restore insulin sensitivity. In this study, we found that intraperitoneal injection of Ori rescued IR, reduced the autophagosome formation and synaptic loss and improved cognitive dysfunction in MHE rats. Moreover, in insulin-resistant PC12 cells and N2a cells, we found that Ori blocked IR-induced synaptic deficits via the down-regulation of PTEN, the phosphorylation of Akt and the inhibition of autophagy. Taken together, these results suggested that Ori displays therapeutic efficacy towards memory deficits via improvement of IR in MHE and represents a novel bioactive therapeutic agent for treating MHE.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

A total of 243 L. gibbus were sampled between January 2013 and December 2016 from occasional harvests of commercial fishers. Examination of sectioned otoliths revealed that opaque increment formation occurred annually between November and March, coinciding with the species' spawning season. Estimates of maximum age were similar between sexes, with observed ages of 38 and 36 years for females and males, respectively, extending the reported longevity of this species by at least 11 years. Growth differed significantly between sexes, with males reaching greater length at age and greater asymptotic length than females (38.88 v. 31.46 cm fork length (L<sub>F</sub> ). Total mortality for all samples was estimated as 0.13 and was slightly higher for males (0.16) than females (0.11). Estimates of natural and fishing mortality were low and slightly higher for males than females. Male L. gibbus were found to mature at slightly greater lengths and younger ages than females, with the length and age at which 50% of individuals attained maturity estimated to be 25.8 cm L<sub>F</sub> and 3.9 years of age for females and 26.8 cm L<sub>F</sub> and 3.4 years of age for males. The results provide key baseline information from which to assess the effect of fishing on the species for populations in New Caledonia and adjacent locations and, when viewed with those of other studies, highlight the importance of understanding spatial patterns in demography of harvested fish species across gradients of exploitation and environmental influences.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Kinematic differences in shoulder roll and hip roll at different front crawl speeds in National Level Swimmers. J Strength Cond Res 34(1): 20-25, 2020-Dry-land strength training is a common component of swimming programs; however, its efficacy is contentious. A common criticism of dry-land strength training for swimming is a lack of specificity. An understanding of movement patterns in swimming can enable dry-land strength training programs to be developed to elicit adaptations that transfer to improvements in swimming performance. This study aimed to quantify the range and velocity of hip roll, shoulder roll, and torso twist (produced by differences in the relative angle between shoulder roll and hip roll) in front crawl at different swimming speeds. Longitudinal torso kinematics was compared between sprint and 400-m pace front crawl using 3D kinematics of 13 elite Scottish front crawl specialists. The range (sprint: 78.1°; 400 m: 61.3°) and velocity of torso twist (sprint: 166.3°·s; 400 m: 96.9°·s) were greater at sprint than 400-m pace. These differences were attributed to reductions in hip roll (sprint: 36.8°; 400 m: 49.9°) without corresponding reductions in shoulder roll (sprint: 97.7°; 400 m: 101.6°) when subjects swam faster. Shoulder roll velocity (sprint: 190.9°·s; 400 m: 139.2°·s) and hip roll velocity (sprint: 75.5°·s; 400 m: 69.1°·s) were greater at sprint than 400-m pace due to a higher stroke frequency at sprint pace (sprint: 0.95 strokes·s; 400 m: 0.70 strokes·s). These findings imply that torques acting to rotate the upper torso and the lower torso are greater at sprint than 400-m pace. Dry-land strength training specificity can be improved by designing exercises that challenge the torso muscles to reproduce the torques required to generate the longitudinal kinematics in front crawl.</AbstractText>"}

SUMOylation in particular has emerged as a crucial cellular mechanism involved in multiple pathologies, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, immunological and neurological disorders, as well as aging. Convergence of these two PTMs result in the ubiquitination of SUMOylated proteins, adding complexity in the modulation of protein functions. The SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligases (STUbL) mediate this process, and RNF4, the mammalian STUbL, has been at the forefront in the understanding of this phenomenon. It has been shown to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, ranging from the maintenance of genomic integrity and hence, oncogenesis, to a role in development. Recent identification of direct and indirect RNF4 targets has revealed that the SUMOylation machinery is in itself targeted by RNF4, highlighting the complex nature of the signaling circuitry tightly regulating these processes. This review will touch upon both SUMOylation and ubiquitination, and will focus on how RNF4, which is at the heart of both these PTMs, modulates cellular signaling and promotes protein degradation. Moreover, the potential of therapeutically targeting RNF4 to improve cancer treatment is also explored.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

It is well known that during aging sperm quality and quantity declines and leads to age-related infertility problems in males. The results of the present study showed that there were elevated levels of oxidative stress and poor DNA integrity of sperm of aged rats. The expression of BCL2 also showed a significant decline in the sperm of aged rats, however, the expression of BAX and active caspase-3 did not show significant change compared with the control group. The treatment of vitamin D3 at lower doses to aged rats showed increased expression of BAX and active caspase-3 in the sperm, this finding suggests that increased apoptosis may be responsible for removal of poor quality sperm during aging. Vitamin D3 treatment at both doses showed improvement in the oxidative stress and DNA integrity in the sperm of aged rats. We also investigated the expression of AGER, visfatin, and HSPA1A in the epididymal sperm. It has been found that expression of AGER, visfatin, and HSPA1A increased in the sperm aged rats and vitamin D3 treatments at both doses decreased its expression. Thus, it might be suggested that during aging vitamin D3 treatment would be important for managing the sperm quality by regulating the apoptosis, antioxidant system and DNA integrity via modulation of visfatin and HSPA1A.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Storage of carotenoids may not simply be passive and dependent on their environmental availability, as storage variation exists at various taxonomic scales, including among individuals within species. While the strong antioxidant and sometimes immune-stimulating properties of carotenoids may be beneficial enough to cause the evolution of features improving their assimilation and storage, they may also have fitness downsides explaining why massive carotenoid storage is not universal. Here, the functional and ecological implications of carotenoid storage for the evolution of invertebrate innate immune defenses are examined, especially in crustaceans, which massively store carotenoids for unclear reasons. Three testable hypotheses about the role of carotenoid storage in immunological (resistance and tolerance) and life-history strategies (with a focus on aging) are proposed, which may ultimately explain the storage of large amounts of these pigments in a context of host-pathogen interactions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although significant efforts have enabled the identification of common mutations associated with RMS and allowed discrimination of different RMS subtypes, major challenges still exist for the development of novel treatments to further improve prognosis. Although identified by the expression of myogenic markers, there is still significant controversy over whether RMS has myogenic or non-myogenic origins, as the cell of origin is still poorly understood. In the present study, a reliable method is provided for the tumorsphere assay for mouse RMS. The assay is based on functional properties of tumor cells and allows the identification of rare populations in the tumor with tumorigenic functions. Also described are procedures for testing recombinant proteins, integrating transfection protocols with the tumorsphere assay, and evaluating candidate genes involved in tumor development and growth. Described further is a procedure for allograft transplantation of tumorspheres into recipient mice to validate tumorigenic function in vivo. Overall, the described method allows reliable identification and testing of rare RMS tumorigenic populations that can be applied to RMS arising in different contexts.

Both gS199- and pS199-actin molecules had an apparent molecular weight of 40 kDa and were localized as nonfilamentous actin in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Compared with the normal kidney, the immunostaining intensity of gS199-actin increased in podocytes of the glomeruli and in proximal tubules of the diabetic kidney, whereas that of pS199-actin did not change in podocytes but decreased in proximal tubules. We confirmed that the same results could be observed in the glomeruli of the human diabetic kidney. In podocytes of glomeruli cultured in the presence of the <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, increased <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the amount of filamentous actin and in morphological changes.

We quantified the effects of childhood social support, reported retrospectively, on later-life cognitive trajectories and investigated biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying these associations. Latent growth curve models estimated 10-year cognitive trajectories in 8,538 participants (baseline ages 45-93; M<sub>age</sub> = 63) in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project. Independent of sociodemographics, childhood socioeconomic status, and household size, greater retrospective childhood social support was associated with better initial episodic memory, but not verbal fluency or cognitive change, in later adulthood. Associations with initial memory level were mediated by sociodemographic and psychosocial variables; specifically, those who reported greater childhood social support reported higher educational attainment and had better physical and emotional health in adulthood, which were each associated with better memory. These results provide support for broad and enduring effects of childhood social support on mental, physical, and cognitive health decades later.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of galangin on human skin fibroblast HS68 cells under H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> exposure to induce aging. In this study, we demonstrate that galangin could decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory proteins and enhanced collagen formation through promoting the IGF-1R pathway.

Electrodeposition drives uphill reactions by applying electric energy instead of heating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress of electrodeposition technologies in Li-based batteries is summarized. Each component of Li-based batteries can be electrodeposited or synthesized with multiple methods. The advantages of electrodeposition are the main focus, and they are discussed in comparison with traditional technologies with the expectation to inspire innovations to build better Li-based batteries. Electrodeposition coats conformal films on surfaces and can control the film thickness, providing an effective approach to enhancing battery performance. Engineering interfaces by electrodeposition can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and strengthen the adhesion of active materials to substrates, thereby prolonging the battery longevity. Lastly, a perspective of future studies on electrodepositing batteries is provided. The significant merits of electrodeposition should greatly advance the development of Li-based batteries.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

To implement the new concept, we leveraged the inherent heterogeneity in genetic predisposition to such complex phenotypes and emphasized a new counter intuitive phenomenon of antagonistic genetic heterogeneity, which is characterized by misalignment of the directions of genetic effects and the phenotype correlation. This analysis identified 37 loci associated with blood lipids but only one locus, FBXO33, was not reported in previous top GWAS. We, however, found strong effect of antagonistic heterogeneity that leaded to profound (quantitative and qualitative) changes in the associations with blood lipids in most, 25 of 37 or 68%, loci. These changes suggested new roles for some genes, which functions were considered as well established such as GCKR, SIK3 (APOA1 locus), LIPC, LIPG, among the others. The antagonistic heterogeneity highlighted a new class of genetic associations emphasizing beneficial and adverse trade-offs in predisposition to lipids. Our results argue that rigorous analyses dissecting heterogeneity in genetic predisposition to complex traits such as lipids beyond those implemented in current GWAS are required to facilitate translation of genetic discoveries into health care.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is increasing with each year, particularly in the setting of prolonged life expectancy and an aging population. Current treatment approaches, including polypropylene monofilaments are associated with numerous painful and worrisome side-effects. Therefore, scientists are looking for new solutions. A promising alternative to the current treatment is tissue engineering, which can be utilized to re-create support to the vagina and pelvic organs. Tissue engineering requires the use of three-dimensional scaffolds, derived from biocompatible materials. Chitosan is a natural polymer, obtained from shellfish exoskeletons. It is known for its biodegradability, lack of cytotoxicity and non-pyrogenicity. Due to the presence of free hydroxyl and amino groups, it may undergo various modifications. In this paper, we describe a new type of chitosan-based biomaterials, which can be used as a new alternative scaffold that may provide support to prolapse organs. The chitosan scaffold was obtained under microwave radiation using multifunctional amino and organic acids. We discuss the scaffold's characteristics, with an emphasis on its chemical structure and morphology. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis confirmed cross-linking processes with preservation of free amino groups. Moreover, mechanical durability, the stability and swelling ability of the scaffolds in a simulated body fluid were investigated. All of the prepared scaffolds demonstrated very good antioxidant activity and biodegradability. Importantly, the biocompatibility of chitosan scaffolds was examined on human vaginal VK2/E6E7 cell line. No evidence of toxicity was documented, and the cells maintained their presence on the studied materials. These results allude to the lack of toxicity of the scaffolds, and indicate that chitosan-based scaffold should be further investigated in in vivo studies as they may be a promising alternative treatment to pelvic organ prolapse.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, the better understanding for the involved mechanisms of bone metabolism is promising for treat such diseases. Particularly, during the pathological process of bone loss, RANKL as a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, could induce osteoclast precursor cells differentiation into mature osteoclasts, which further play a critical role in osteolysis. In recent years, with the growing attentions paid to the natural compounds researching studies, the therapeutic application of natural active plant derivatives has been widely recognized. Our present study summarized the current novel research progress of RANKL and its downstream signaling pathways in bone cells, and as an important drug targets for its role in bone loss diseases. Besides that, in our review, we briefly introduced the current application of several natural compounds for treating RANKL-mediated osteoclastic activation by modulating the RANKL signaling pathway and their effects on the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Changes in specific motor activities are altered in numerous diseases. KIF20A, a motor protein of the kinesin-6 family, is overexpressed in bladder cancer, and KIF20A levels correlate negatively with clinical outcomes. We report here a new role for the KIF20A kinesin motor protein in intracellular mechanics. Using optical tweezers to probe intracellular mechanics and surface AFM to probe cortical mechanics, we first confirm that bladder urothelial cells soften with an increasing cancer grade. We then show that inhibiting KIF20A makes the intracellular environment softer for both high- and low-grade bladder cancer cells. Upon inhibition of KIF20A, cortical stiffness also decreases in lower grade cells, while it surprisingly increases in higher grade malignant cells. Changes in cortical stiffness correlate with the interaction of KIF20A with myosin IIA. Moreover, KIF20A inhibition negatively regulates bladder cancer cell motility irrespective of the underlying substrate stiffness. Our results reveal a central role for a microtubule motor in cell mechanics and migration in the context of bladder cancer.</AbstractText>"}

Prevention of hypoglycemia is a major priority that should be addressed as soon as its presence or risk is detected, adjusting the target and therapeutics accordingly. Nonetheless, treatment intensification should not be neglected when applicable, consistent with recommendations from organizations such as the American Geriatrics Society and the American Diabetes Association, to reduce not only long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications (individualization), but also short-term complications from hyperglycemia (polyuria, volume depletion, urinary incontinence). Such complications can negatively impact the physical and cognitive function of older adults, worsen their quality of life, and additionally affect their families and society. We emphasize individualization, utilizing the multiple classes of antihyperglycemic agents available. Metformin remains as first-line therapy, and additional agents offer advantages and disadvantages that ought to be considered when developing a patient-centric plan of care. For selected cases, injectable therapies such as long-acting basal insulin analogs and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists can offer advantages to counter hypoglycemia risk, patient-related barriers, and clinical inertia. Furthermore, some injectable agents could potentially simplify regimens while providing safe and effective glycemic control. In this review, we discuss the use of injectable therapies for selected community-dwelling older adults, barriers to transition to injectable therapy, and measures aimed at removing these barriers and assisting physicians and their teams to transition older patients to injectable therapies when appropriate.</AbstractText>"}

The Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) has conducted several such clinical trials, but there has been no formal policy for geriatric research. We have therefore established a JCOG policy for geriatric cancer research. We defined the patient selection policy based on treatment tolerance and chronological age. Older patients are categorized into three conceptual groups: 'fit patients' who can undergo the same standard treatment given to younger patients, 'frail patients' for whom best supportive or palliative care is indicated and 'vulnerable patients' who fall between the fit and frail categories. Unmet needs often exist for vulnerable patients. The policy recommends that study endpoints include not only survival but also other endpoints such as physical and cognitive function because the objective of therapy in older patients is not only extended life expectancy but also maintenance of the patient's general condition. In this viewpoint, co-primary or composite endpoints that incorporate geriatric assessment in the study design are often applicable. Study design will differ depending on the study population, clinical question, and treatment. Even for older patients, a randomized clinical trial is still the gold standard when the clinical question asks which treatment is better. An observational study of a broader population is applicable for investigating actual conditions of older patients. This JCOG Geriatric Research Policy includes several practical solutions for various issues in geriatric research. We plan to revise this policy periodically to guide future geriatric research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the outcome of SDR on adults with spastic diplegia remains undetermined. The aim is to study the effectiveness and morbidities of SDR performed on adults for the treatment of spastic diplegia.  Methods Patients who received SDR in adulthood for the treatment of spastic diplegia were surveyed. The survey questionnaire addressed the living situation, education level, employment, health outcomes, postoperative changes of symptoms, changes in ambulatory function, adverse effects of SDR and orthopedic surgery after SDR.  Results The study included 64 adults, who received SDR for spastic diplegia. The age at the time of surgery was between 18 and 50 years. The age at the time of the survey was between 20 and 52 years. The follow-up period ranged from one to 28 years. The study participants reported post-SDR improvements of the quality of walking in 91%, standing in 81%, sitting in 57%, balance while walking 75%, ability to exercise in 88%, endurance in 77%, and recreational sports in 43%. Muscle and joint pain present before surgery improved in 64% after surgery. Concerning the level of ambulatory function, all patients who walked independently in all environments maintained the same level of ambulatory function. Eighteen percent of the patients who walked independently in some environments improved to the independent walking in all environments. All patients who walked with an assistive device before SDR maintained the assistive walking after SDR.

In general, PPGI is investigated with test persons in a laboratory setting. While these <i>in-vivo</i> tests have the advantage of generating real-life data, they suffer from the lack of repeatability and are comparatively effort-intensive because human subjects are required. Consequently, studying changes in signal morphology, for example, due to aging or pathological effects, is practically impossible. As a tool to study these effects, a hardware PPG simulator has been developed: this is a phantom which simulates and generates both 1D and locally resolved 2D optical PPG signals. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate PPG-like signals with various signal morphologies by means of a purely optoelectronic setup, namely an LED array, and to analyze them by means of PPGI. Signals extracted via a camera show good agreement with simulated generated signals. In fact, the first phantom design is suitable to demonstrate this qualitatively.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study is aimed to evaluate the association of the NO metabolites, namely, nitrite and nitrate, with lung cancer incidence. We conducted a matched case-control study (<i>n</i> = 245 incident lung cancer cases and <i>n</i> = 735 controls) based on the German ESTHER cohort (<i>n</i> = 9,940). Controls were matched to cases on age, sex, smoking status (never/former/current smoking), and pack-years of smoking. The sum of nitrite and nitrate was measured in urine samples using a colorimetric assay and was standardized for renal function by urinary creatinine. Conditional logistic regression models, adjusted for lifestyle factors, asthma prevalence, and family history of lung cancer, were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Among incident lung cancer cases, high nitrite/nitrate levels were statistically significantly associated with current smoking, a low BMI, and the oxidative stress biomarker 8-isoprostane levels. Nitrite/nitrate levels in the top quintile were statistically significantly associated with lung cancer incidence: the OR (95% CI) was 1.37 (1.04-1.82) for comparison with the bottom quintile. This association was unaltered after additional adjustment for 8-isoprostane levels and C-reactive protein (CRP). In conclusion, this large cohort study suggested that subjects with high urinary nitrite/nitrate concentrations had an increased risk of lung cancer and this association was independent of smoking, CRP, 8-isoprostane levels, and other established lung cancer risk factors. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to confirm the hypothesis that pathologically high levels of NO are involved in lung cancer development.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Xīn Gào et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Oxidative stress is linked to cardiovascular pathology in the black South African individuals who have a high prevalence of hypertension and early vascular aging. However, there are limited data relating changes in oxidative stress with vascular and renal deterioration over time. We aimed to investigate whether changes in oxidative stress over 3 years are associated with target organ damage in black (N = 89) and white (N = 91) men. Carotid intima-media thickness was measured using the SonoSite Micromaxx ultrasound system, and cross-sectional wall area (CSWA) was calculated. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. The percentage change (%∆) in oxidative stress markers was calculated and included reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR). Over 3 years, black men exhibited decreased ROS, SOD, and GR, while white men revealed decreased SOD and GPx. Black men displayed positive associations of CSWA with %∆ ROS (β = 0.28; p = 0.017) and %∆ SOD (β = 0.24; p = 0.047). White men displayed a negative association of CSWA with %∆ SOD (β = -0.22; p = 0.042) and positive associations of eGFR with %∆ GPx (β = 0.33; p = 0.001) and %∆ GR (β = 0.39; p &lt; 0.001). In white men, the association of CSWA with decreased SOD activity suggests oxidative-stress-related carotid remodeling, while associations of eGFR with the glutathione system suggests a postponement of microvascular deterioration. In black men, associations of oxidative stress markers with CSWA suggest that a sufficiently functioning antioxidant system may delay target organ damage.</AbstractText>"}

Activation of ERSU causes the septin ring to mislocalize, which blocks ER inheritance and cytokinesis. Here, we uncover that the septin ring in fact translocates to previously utilized cell division sites called cytokinetic remnants (CRMs). This unconventional translocation requires Nba1, a negative polarity regulator that normally prevents repolarization and re-budding at CRMs. Furthermore, septin ring translocation relies on the recruitment and activation of a key ERSU component Slt2 by Bem1, without activating Cdc42. Failure to transfer all septin subunits to CRMs delays the cell's ability to re-enter the cell cycle when ER homeostasis is restored and hinders cell growth after ER stress recovery. Thus, these deliberate but unprecedented rearrangements of cell polarity factors during ER stress safeguard cell survival and the timely cell-cycle re-entry upon ER stress recovery.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our working hypothesis is that the form of fatigue resulting from physical training overload might share some neural underpinnings with the form of fatigue observed after prolonged intellectual work, which was previously shown to affect the cognitive control brain system. Indeed, cognitive control may be required to prevent any impulsive behavior, including stopping physical effort when it hurts, despite the long-term goal of improving performance through intense training. To test this hypothesis, we induced a mild form of overtraining in a group of endurance athletes, which we compared to a group of normally trained athletes on behavioral tasks performed during fMRI scanning. At the behavioral level, training overload enhanced impulsivity in economic choice, which was captured by a bias favoring immediate over delayed rewards in our computational model. At the neural level, training overload resulted in diminished activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, a key region of the cognitive control system, during economic choice. Our results therefore provide causal evidence for a functional link between enduring physical exercise and exerting cognitive control. Besides, the concept of cognitive control fatigue bridges the functional consequences of excessive physical training and intellectual work into a single neuro-computational mechanism, which might contribute to other clinical forms of burnout syndromes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Their slip trial and natural walking trial immediately prior to it were analyzed. To identify the best fall-risk predictive model, gait related variables including step length, segment angles, center of mass state, and ground reaction force (GRF) were determined and inputted into a stepwise logistic regression. The optimal slip-induced fall prediction model was based on the right thigh angle at slipping foot touchdown (TD), the maximum GRF of the slipping limb after TD, and the momentum change from TD to recovery foot liftoff (LO), with an overall prediction accuracy of 75.9%, predicting 74.5% of falls (sensitivity) and 77.2% of recoveries (specificity). Conversely, a model based on clinical and demographic measures predicted 78.2% of falls and 47.4% of recoveries, resulting in a much lower overall accuracy of 62.5%. The fall-risk model based on normal gait pattern which was developed for slip-induced perturbations in healthy older adults was able to provide a high predictive accuracy.

The genetic risk factors and underlying pathology of ARHI are largely unknown, meaning that targets for new therapies remain elusive, yet heritability estimates range between 35% and 55%. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for two self-reported hearing phenotypes, using more than 250,000 UK Biobank (UKBB) volunteers aged between 40 and 69 years. Forty-four independent genome-wide significant loci (p &lt; 5E-08) were identified, considerably increasing the number of established trait loci. Thirty-four loci are novel associations with hearing loss of any form, and only one of the ten known hearing loci has a previously reported association with an ARHI-related trait. Gene sets from these loci are enriched in auditory processes such as synaptic activities, nervous system processes, inner ear morphology, and cognition, while genetic correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations with multiple personality and psychological traits for the first time. Immunohistochemistry for protein localization in adult mouse cochlea implicate metabolic, sensory, and neuronal functions for NID2, CLRN2, and ARHGEF28.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple and effective method to improve their intrinsic stability. Herein, the 1,1,1-trimethylhydrazinium cation (TMH<sup>+</sup>) was first introduced into MAPbI<sub>3</sub> to fabricate high-performance mixed-cation perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, which benefits by the improved crystallization and morphology of films. On the one hand, the slightly large size of TMH<sup>+</sup> is complementary to the low tolerance factor of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and then enhances the structure stability. On the other hand, the presence of methyl groups in TMH<sup>+</sup> is beneficial to promote the hydrophobicity of MA-based perovskite. More importantly, the hydrazinium group can effectively inhibit the production of Pb<sup>0</sup> in perovskites, which is the initial stage of degradation. As a result, the intrinsic stability of PSCs has been observably boosted. After aging at 45 ± 5% RH for 1800 h and 85 °C for 200 h, the unencapsulated PSCs retained 77 and 79% of initial PCE, respectively.

However, layered mesostructures have not been combined due to the immense difficulties by conventional chemical, mechanical exfoliation or self-assembly approaches. Herein, we explore a bottom-up strategy, carried out under mild conditions, for the facile synthesis of monolayered mesoporous-titania-mesoporous-carbon vertical heterostructure with uniform mesopore size, which enables ultrahigh rate capability and cycling longevity for pseudocapacitive sodium-ion storage in nonaqueous electrolyte. Such a brand-new type of heterostructure consists of well-ordered monolayered mesoporous titania nanosheets and surrounding two mesoporous carbon monolayers assembled at both sides. Remarkably, the combination of interconnected large mesoporosity and heterointerface leads to highly promoted reversible pseudocapacitance (96.4% of total charge storage at a sweep rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup>), and it enables the material to retain strong mechanical stability during the rapid sodiation and desodiation processes.

Main Outcome Measures Successful application of the PADR-EC Score and an evaluation of general practitioners' acceptance of the PADR-EC Score are the two outcome measures of the project. Results The PADR-EC score was applied by the practice pharmacist and reported to GPs for 428 patients aged ≥ 65 years, with 24.8% classified as high-risk. The focus group found the PADR-EC score helped raise awareness of the risk of adverse drug reactions in the general practice setting. Doctors demonstrated good understanding of the PADR-EC Score and there were no negative reactions to the delivery model used. No changes to prescribing were implemented directly as a result of the PADR-EC Score, but more caution was used when doctors provided their usual clinical care. Conclusion Doctors used the PADR-EC score to complement their decision making. The PADR-EC Score was used as a reminder to review existing medication lists, follow-up on pathology results that may impact drug treatment and assess patients for prevalent ADRs. Further research is needed to validate the PADR-EC score in this setting.</AbstractText>"}

Plant-derived essential oils are natural products that exhibit insecticidal and repellant activities and represent a promising alternative to synthetic repellants. However, mechanisms by which ticks detect odor stimuli and how such stimuli may function as repellents are not well understood. We examined the repellent activity of selected essential oil components towards I. scapularis in short- and long-term dose-response trials. To determine the specific olfactory organs involved in detection of chemical stimuli, we tested tick behavioral response in repellency bioassays after removing appendages that house chemosensory sensilla (e.g., foretarsi or pedipalps). New prototype formulae were tested in longevity trials repelling up to 95% of tested ticks after 1 h post-application. This study provides new insight regarding tick olfaction and behavior, and innovative methods for selecting appropriate chemicals for development of novel plant-based repellent products for protection from ticks.</AbstractText>"}

Our previous studies have shown that calcium influx mediated by the Arabidopsis glutamate receptor homolog 3.5 (AtGLR3.5) modulates the expression of the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) transcription factor during germination and that L-methionine (L-Met) activates AtGLR3.1/3.5 Ca2+ channels in guard cells. However, it is not known whether L-Met participates in regulation of germination and what cellular mechanism is responsible for Met production during germination. Here, we describe Arabidopsis methionine synthase 1 (AtMS1), which acts in the final step of Met biosynthesis, synthesizes the Met required for the activation of AtGLR3.5 Ca2+ channels whose expression is up-regulated during germination, leading to the regulation of seed germination. We show that exogenous L-Met promotes germination in an AtGRL3.5-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that L-Met directly regulates the AtGLR3.5-mediated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ level in seedlings. We provide pharmacological and genetic evidence that Met synthesized via AtMS1 acts upstream of the AtGLR3.5-mediated Ca2+ signal and regulates the expression of ABI4, a major regulator in the abscisic acid response in seeds. Overall, our results link AtMS1, L-Met, the AtGLR3.5 Ca2+ channel, Ca2+ signals, and ABI4, and shed light on the physiological role and molecular mechanism of L-Met in germination.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes have been identified in the majority of cases. Alongside these, an increasing number of genes are repeatedly identified as mutated in MPN. These, including ASXL1, TET2, DMNT3A, and EZH2, have key roles in epigenetic regulation. Dysregulation of epigenetic processes is therefore a key feature of MPN. Vorinostat is a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) that has been investigated in MPN. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a well-defined epigenetic mechanism of transcription modification. It is known to be affected by ageing, lifestyle, and disease. Epigenetic ageing signatures have been previously described allowing calculation of a methylation age (MA). In this study we examined the effect of vorinostat on MA in MPN cell lines and in patients with polycythaemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET) treated with vorinostat as part of a clinical trial. An older MA was observed in patients with a higher JAK2 V617F allele burden and those with a longer duration of disease. PV patients had a MA older than that predicted whilst MA was younger than predicted in ET. Treatment with vorinostat resulted in a younger MA in PV patients and older MA in ET patients, in both cases a trend towards the normal chronological age. When MA change was compared against response, nonresponse was associated with a younger than predicted MA in ET patients and a higher than predicted MA in PV patients. The link between MA and JAK2 mutant allele burden implies that allele burden has a role not only in clinical phenotype and disease evolution in MPN patients, but also in the overall methylation landscape of the mutated cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

A shift of the torque-angle relationship is caused by the aging process (increasing or reducing the range of motion) affecting the force production in a given muscular length during ADLs. Thus, the relationship between hip extensor-flexor muscles' force production and their association with functional capacity tests in elderly women were evaluated. Seventeen elderly women performed timed up and go, timed up and down stairs, and 30-s chair stand tests. Hip extensor-flexor isometric peak torques at 15°, 60°, 90°, and 100° (0° = full extension) were also assessed. Hip flexors produced the highest absolute and relative peak torque at a 15° angle and hip extensor muscles at 100°. A large and significant correlation (r = 0.62, p = 0.008) was observed only between absolute hip extensor peak torque at 90° and the 30-s chair stand test. When peak torque was normalized by body mass, the hip extensor-flexor muscles' peak torque obtained at all measured angles presented significant correlation with the 30-s chair stand test. The results indicate that for older women there is an optimum torque-angle for the hip flexor and extensor muscles. Furthermore, although the hip torque-angle relationship was measured under isometric contractions, there was a correlation with the 30-s chair stand test, which could indicate the presence of the isometric component during this movement.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As much as the effects of pollution and UV irradiation on human skin have been described, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This state of the art study aims at exposing the numerous adverse effects of UV and pollution as well as their mode of action on skin.

Our previous <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies found that preconditioning with NSC-sEVs promoted the recovery of functional behaviors following spinal cord injury by activating autophagy. However, the underlying mechanisms for such observations remain unclear. In this study, we further explored the mechanisms by which NSC-sEVs repair spinal cord injury via autophagy. We found that NSC-sEVs contain 14-3-3t protein, of which the overexpression or knockdown enhanced and decreased autophagy, respectively. In addition, 14-3-3t overexpression enhanced the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of NSC-sEVs, further promoting functional behavior recovery following spinal cord injury. The overexpression of 14-3-3t was used to further validate the <i>in vivo</i> results through a series of <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Conversely, knockdown of 14-3-3t attenuated the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of NSC-sEVs. Further studies also confirmed that NSC-sEVs increased Beclin-1 expression, with which 14-3-3t interacted and promoted its localization to autophagosome precursors. In this study, we found that NSC-sEVs deliver 14-3-3t, which interacts with Beclin-1 to activate autophagy. Our results indicate that 14-3-3t acts via a newly-discovered mechanism for the activation of autophagy by NSC-sEVs.</AbstractText>"}

Hyperspectral remote sensing of clothing will be an important tool for supporting such investigations in the near future. This study investigated over 300 items of clothing that varied in fabric type, texture, color, and pattern. Clothing items were analyzed using an ASD FieldSpec 4 High Resolution spectroradiometer with a contact probe attachment. Of the clothing items analyzed, there were 141 having endmember fabrics (100% single fabric type composition): 89 were cotton, 39 were polyester, 5 were wool, 1 was cashmere, 3 were acrylic, 1 was leather, and 3 were rayon. The remaining 164 clothing items were various fabric blends. Spectral features relating to different fabric types exhibit sufficient differences that allow them to be discriminated from the surrounding environment, as well as from one another in many, but not all, cases. Cotton and polyester, in particular, two of the most widely-used fabrics, exhibit numerous features in the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) that would allow them to easily be distinguished from geologic materials in the environment such as rocks and soil. Plant based fibers, especially cotton, possess similar reflectance features to vegetation owing to their cellulose content. Outdoor aging experiments were conducted for 19 weeks on selected fabrics. Although significant changes were observed in aged garments, the variability observed in the reflectance of the aged garments does not support the derivation of a metric for aging, at least over the relatively short time scale of this effort. Results from this study should support numerous forensic efforts globally for non-destructive investigation of clothing items in the field and in lab settings with a spectroradiometer, enhance the potential for remote sensing searches, and in the future, potentially documenting crime scenes with hyperspectral imaging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Five electronic databases were searched for studies, which compared measures of CPM and TS among healthy, chronic pain-free younger, middle-aged, and older adults. Eleven studies were included in the final review for TS and 11 studies were included in the review of CPM. The results suggested a moderate magnitude of difference in TS among younger and middle-aged/older adults, with the older cohorts exhibiting enhanced TS of pain. Considerable variability existed in the magnitude of the effect sizes, which was likely due to the different experimental methodologies used across studies (ie, interstimulus interval, stimulus type, and body location). In regards to CPM, the data revealed a large magnitude of difference between younger and older adults, with younger adults exhibiting more efficient pain inhibition. Differences in CPM between middle-aged and older adults were minimal. The magnitude of pain inhibition during CPM in older adults may depend on the use of concurrent versus nonconcurrent protocols. In summary, the data provided strong quantitative evidence of a general age-related decline in endogenous pain modulatory function as measured by TS and CPM.

Although TSPO function has not been fully determined, synthetic TSPO ligands have beneficial effects on different pathologies of the central nervous system, including the retina. Here, we studied the pattern of Tspo expression in the aging human retina and in two mouse models of retinal degeneration. Using a newly generated Tspo-KO mouse, we investigated the impact of the lack of TSPO on retinal morphology, function and susceptibility to degeneration. We show that TSPO was expressed in both human and mouse retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Tspo was induced in the mouse retina upon degeneration, but constitutively expressed in the RPE. Similarly, TSPO expression levels in healthy human retina and RPE were not differentially regulated during aging. Tspo-KO mice had normal retinal morphology and function up to 48 weeks of age. Photoreceptor loss caused either by exposure to excessive light levels or by a mutation in the phosphodiesterase 6b gene was not affected by the absence of Tspo. The reactivity states of retinal mononuclear phagocytes following light-damage were comparable in Tspo-KO and control mice. Our data suggest that lack of endogenous TSPO does not directly influence the magnitude of photoreceptor degeneration or microglia activation in these two models of retinal degeneration. We therefore hypothesize that the interaction of TSPO with its ligands may be required to modulate disease progression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The inhibition of PPAR-γ expression by microRNA (miR)-27a in IR cells at both the protein and mRNA levels was confirmed by a mechanistic investigation. Moreover, the 3'-UTR of PPAR-γ was found to be a direct target of miR-27a, based on the DLRA.

Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STI1; STIP1; HOP) is a co-chaperone that simultaneously interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90, but whose function in vivo remains poorly understood. We combined in-depth analysis of chaperone genes in human datasets, analysis of a neuronal cell line lacking STI1 and of a mouse line with a hypomorphic Stip1 allele to investigate the requirement for STI1 in aging. Our experiments revealed that dysfunctional STI1 activity compromised Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone network and neuronal resilience. The levels of a set of Hsp90 co-chaperones and client proteins were selectively affected by reduced levels of STI1, suggesting that their stability depends on functional Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery. Analysis of human databases revealed a subset of co-chaperones, including STI1, whose loss of function is incompatible with life in mammals, albeit they are not essential in yeast. Importantly, mice expressing a hypomorphic STI1 allele presented spontaneous age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration and reduced hippocampal volume, with consequent spatial memory deficit.

Auditory acuity and temporally controlled neuronal firing underpin this ability. Deterioration in neuronal firing precision likely contributes to poorer hearing performance, yet the role of neural processing by key nuclei in the central auditory pathways is not fully understood. Here, we record from the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body [MGB]) of young and middle-aged, normally hearing male CBA/Ca mice. We report changes in temporal processing of auditory stimuli, with neurons recorded from ventral and medial MGB subdivisions of older animals more likely to synchronize to rapid temporally varying stimuli. MGB subdivisions also showed increased probability of neuronal firing and shorter response latencies to clicks in older animals. Histological investigation of neuronal extracellular specializations, perineuronal nets (PNNs) and axonal coats, in the MGB identified greater organization of PNNs around MGB neurons and the presence of axonal coats within older animals. This supports the observation that neural responses recorded from ventral and medial MGB of older mice were more likely to synchronize to temporally varying stimuli presented at faster repetition rates than those recorded from young adult animals. These changes are observed in animals with normal hearing thresholds, confirming that neural processing differs between the MGB subdivisions and such processing is associated with age-related changes to PNNs. Understanding these age-related changes and how they occur have important implications for the design of effective therapeutic interventions to improve speech intelligibility into later life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In conditions distinct from the frontotemporal lobar degenerations, TDP-43 appears to progress in a stereotypical pattern. In the present study, we aimed at providing a better understanding of the effects of TDP-43 and other age-related neuropathologies on cross-sectional grey matter volume in a cohort of non-FTLD subjects. We included 407 individuals with an antemortem MRI and post-mortem brain tissue from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. All individuals were assigned pathological stages for TDP-43, tau, amyloid-β, Lewy bodies, argyrophilic grain disease and vascular pathologies. Robust regressions were performed in regions of interest and voxel-wise to explore the relationships between TDP-43 stages and grey matter volume while controlling for other pathologies. Grey matter volumes adjusted for pathological and demographic variables were also computed for each TDP-43-positive case to further characterize the sequential involvement of brain structures associated with TDP-43, irrespective of the TDP-43 staging scheme. Robust regressions showed that the extent of TDP-43 pathology was associated with the extent of grey matter atrophy. Specifically, we found that the volume in medial temporal regions (i.e. amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus) decreased progressively with advancing TDP-43 stages. Importantly, these effects were of similar magnitude to those related to tau stages. Additional analyses using adjusted grey matter volume demonstrated a sequential pattern of volume loss associated with TDP-43, starting within the medial temporal lobe, followed by early involvement of the temporal pole, and eventually encompassing additional temporal and frontal regions. Altogether, this study demonstrates the major and independent contribution of TDP-43 pathology on neurodegeneration and provides further insight into the regional distribution of TDP-43 in non-FTLD subjects. Along with previous studies, these findings emphasized the importance of targeting TDP-43 in future clinical trials to prevent its detrimental effect on grey matter volume and, eventually, cognition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

However, there is limited research evidence in prosthodontic practice, necessary to tackle key questions to improve oral and dental health. In addition, many overarching challenges exist within the NHS system relevant to prosthodontics. For example, demands on healthcare services from increasing patient expectations, the ever-ageing and growing population, risks of litigation, availability of appropriate care, difficulties with access to care, rapidly emerging treatments and technologies, and ongoing needs for education. This article develops clinical and academic recommendations to improve oral health improvements in PDC prosthodontics, further to recommendations determined by the James Lind Alliance, a non-profit making initiative to tackle treatment 'uncertainties' (http://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/), and the overarching challenges, which are mentioned above. Considerable clinical and academic author experiences from primary, secondary and tertiary care as well as education and research in prosthodontics are employed. We consider management of networks involving patients, carers, healthcare professionals, industry and academics, in order to increase access to improve oral and general health and help drive dental research, education and communication. We investigate how to manage dental disease and intervene to improve the longevity of restorations and the dentition. Finally, we review how rapidly developing digital technologies can best be utilised, in conjunction with industry, in order to improve oral health.</AbstractText>"}

The current study investigated the abilities of plasma Aβ42 and total-tau (t-tau) levels in predicting cognitive decline in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma Aβ42 and t-tau levels were quantified in 22 participants with amnestic MCI through immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay at baseline. The cognitive performance of participants was measured through neuropsychological tests at baseline and annual follow-up (average follow-up period of 1.5 years). The predictive value of plasma Aβ42 and t-tau for cognitive status was evaluated. We found that higher levels of Aβ42 and t-tau are associated with lower episodic verbal memory performance at baseline and cognitive decline over the course of follow-up. While Aβ42 or t-tau alone had moderate-to-high discriminatory value in the identification of future cognitive decline, the product of Aβ42 and t-tau offered greater differential value. These preliminary results might suggest that high levels of plasma Aβ42 and t-tau in amnestic MCI are associated with later cognitive decline. A further replication with a larger sample over a longer time period to validate and determine their long-term predictive value is warranted.</AbstractText>"}

The use of candidate genes whose expression remains stable during aging is required to correctly address the age-associated variations in expression levels. Reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become a powerful approach for sensitive gene expression analysis. Reliable RT-qPCR assays rely on the normalisation of the results to stable reference genes. Taken these data together, here we evaluated the expression stability of eight frequently used reference genes in three aging models: oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), in vitro and in vivo aging. Using NormFinder and geNorm algorithms, we identified that the most stable reference gene pairs were PUM1 and TBP in OIS, GUSB and PUM1 for in vitro aging and GUSB and OAZ1 for in vivo aging. To validate these candidates, we used them to normalise the expression data of CDKN1A, APOD and TFRC genes, whose expression is known to be affected during OIS, in vitro and in vivo aging. This study demonstrates that accurate normalisation of RT-qPCR data is crucial in aging research and provides a specific subset of stable reference genes for future aging studies.</AbstractText>"}

While typical UCNPs produce multiple simultaneous emissions for unidirectional control of biological processes, programmable control requires orthogonal non-overlapping light emissions. These can be obtained through doping nanocrystals with multiple activator ions. However, this requires tedious synthesis and produces complicated multi-shell nanoparticles with a lack of control over emission profiles due to activator crosstalk. Herein, we explore cross-relaxation (CR), a non-radiative recombination pathway typically perceived as deleterious, to manipulate energy migration within the same lanthanide activator ion (Er<sup>3+</sup>) towards orthogonal red and green emissions, simply by adjusting excitation wavelength from 980 to 808 nm.

Recent studies suggest that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) regulates endothelial permeability in inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of RAGE in endothelial hyperpermeability induced by angiotensin II (Ang II), a well-known inflammatory mediator, and the potential therapeutic effect of soluble RAGE (sRAGE), a decoy receptor for RAGE ligands. For in vitro studies, Ang II-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with siRNA specific to either RAGE or sRAGE to disrupt RAGE-mediated signaling. Endothelial permeability was estimated using FITC-labeled dextran 40 and a resistance meter. To evaluate intercellular junction disruption, VE-cadherin expression was examined by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Ang II increased the expression of the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and RAGE, and this increase was inhibited by sRAGE. sRAGE prevented Ang II-induced VE-cadherin disruption in HUVECs. For in vivo studies, Ang II-infused, atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout mice were utilized. Endothelial permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining of the aorta. Ang II increased endothelial barrier permeability, and this effect was significantly attenuated by sRAGE. Our data demonstrate that blockade of RAGE signaling using sRAGE attenuates Ang II-induced endothelial barrier permeability in vitro and in vivo and indicate the therapeutic potential of sRAGE in controlling vascular permeability under pathological conditions.</AbstractText>"}

What's more, higher expression of TIP-B1 were correlated with aggressive clinico-pathological characteristics. In vitro assay found TIP-B1 knockdown dramatically inhibited KIRC cells proliferation, migration and invasion. In vivo assay found down regulated TIP-B1 could suppress tumor growth and metastasis.

We generated a knock-in mouse model based on human p.V37I variant (c.109G&gt;A) that recapitulated the human phenotype. Cochlear pathology revealed no significant hair cell loss, stria vascularis atrophy or spiral ganglion neuron loss, but a significant change in the length of gap junction plaques, which may have contributed to the observed mild endocochlear potential (EP) drop in homozygous mice lasting lifetime. The cochlear amplification in homozygous mice was compromised, but outer hair cells' function remained unchanged, indicating that the reduced amplification was EP- rather than prestin-generated. In addition to ABR threshold elevation, ABR wave I latencies were also prolonged in aged homozygous animals. We found in homozygous IHCs a significant increase in I<sub>Ca</sub> but no change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> efficiency in triggering exocytosis. Environmental insults such as noise exposure, middle ear injection of KCl solution and systemic application of furosemide all exacerbated the pathological phenotype in homozygous mice. We conclude that this <i>Gjb2</i> mutation-induced hearing loss results from 1) reduced cochlear amplifier caused by lowered EP, 2) IHCs excitotoxicity associated with potassium accumulation around hair cells, and 3) progression induced by environmental insults.</AbstractText>"}

Metabolic inflexibility, such as occurs with diabetes, increases cardiac reliance on fatty acids to meet energetic demands, and this results in deleterious effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction, that contribute to pathophysiology. Enhancing glucose usage may mitigate metabolic inflexibility and be advantageous under such conditions. Here, we sought to identify how mitochondrial function and cardiac metabolism are affected in a transgenic mouse model of enhanced cardiac glycolysis (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup>) basally and following a short-term (7-day) high-fat diet (HFD). Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice constitutively express an active form of phosphofructokinase-2, resulting in elevated levels of the PFK-1 allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. We report that basally Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mitochondria exhibit augmented pyruvate-supported respiration relative to fatty acids. Nevertheless, both WT and Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mitochondria had a similar shift toward increased rates of fatty acid-supported respiration following HFD. Metabolic profiling by GC-MS revealed distinct features based on both genotype and diet, with a unique increase in branched-chain amino acids in the Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> HFD group. Targeted quantitative proteomics analysis also supported both genotype- and diet-dependent changes in protein expression and uncovered an enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in the Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> HFD group. These results support a newly identified mechanism whereby the levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate promote mitochondrial PDK4 levels and identify a secondary adaptive response that prevents excessive mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation when glycolysis is sustained after a high-fat dietary challenge.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Newhardt et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although, previous studies highlight the importance of personality on objective cognitive performance, no studies clarify their role with subjective executive function. To inform methods of early identification of cognitive impairment, this study explored how temperament and personality traits account for problems in subjective executive function. <b>Method:</b> The current project examined the associations between temperament and personality on subjective executive function across two samples of community-dwelling older adults (65+ years, <i>n</i><sub>1</sub> = 25, <i>n</i><sub>2</sub> = 50). Both studies measured subjective executive function (Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult) and separately administered scales on temperament (Adult Temperament Questionnaire) and personality (Big Five Inventory). <b>Results:</b> Concerning temperament, older adults higher in negative affect endorsed greater difficulty in subjective executive function. Regarding personality traits, older adults with higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness reported higher difficulty in subjective executive function. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings enhance our understanding of subtle cognitive changes and may aid in early detection. In particular, distressful inclinations were associated with more reported problems in executive function whereas problem-solving tendencies were inversely related. Future work should examine if enhanced negativity coupled with analytical disengagement predicts problems in subjective executive function over time.</AbstractText>"}

Participants were forty physically frail residents of four NHs in the Netherlands. Residents were interviewed about depressive symptoms (CES-D) and activities they conducted over the previous week. Three researchers independently rank ordered each activity on the degree to which it could be regarded as having physical, creative, social, cognitive, and musical components. Accounting for the rank score and the time the resident spent on that activity, residents were categorized per activity component into four levels: absent, low, medium, and high. <b>Results:</b> Mixed models predicting depressive symptoms from individual activity components showed significant associations for the social and cognitive components.

Personality traits were analyzed independently and as combined Neuroticism-Extraversion quadrants. Linear mixed effect models (LMEM) and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to examine continuous change and incidence of decline in PSS, respectively. Analyses were conducted for the entire sample and in stratified models in order to explore the potential moderating effect of gender. <b>Results:</b> Personality was identified as a significant predictor of PSS change, including personality quadrants and High Neuroticism alone. Stratified models revealed significant gender differences, with High Neuroticism-Low Extraversion and High Neuroticism alone consistently linked to PSS decline in males, while Low Neuroticism-Low Extraversion was linked to PSS decline in females. <b>Conclusion:</b> Patterns in LMEM and Cox model results suggest that PSS decline in males is likely associated with High Neuroticism, while PSS decline in females may be associated instead with Low Extraversion.

The performance of the nomograms, compared to models without comorbidity and FS, was evaluated in the validation set using concordance index (C-index). The C-indexes of the nomograms for overall and disease-free survival in the validation set were 0.768 and 0.737, which were substantially higher than those of models including tumor stage only (0.707 and 0.701) or models including stage, age, sex, and tumor location (0.749 and 0.718).

The sample comprised a total of 109 adults, aged 50 to 85 (M = 66.09, S.D. = 9.02). They were divided into three groups: 1) older adults with VRF, 2) MCI patients, and 3) healthy controls (HC). VRF and MCI did not differ significantly in age, educational level, or gender as was the case with HC. The tests used mainly examine inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory processing. Results showed that the VRF group had more Set Loss Errors in drawing designs indicating deficits in establishing cognitive set and in cognitive shifting. MCI patients displayed lower performance in processing. Hence, different types of specific impairments emerge in vascular aging and MCI, and this may imply that discrete underlying pathologies may play a role in the development of somewhat different profiles of cognitive decline.</AbstractText>"}

We use five waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) between the years 2004 and 2015 for a total of 43,435 individuals and 117,831 observations. Health is defined as a Frailty Index calculated from 40 items. Caregiving is defined as intensive help with personal care provided to spouses. Results from asymmetric fixed-effects linear regression models show that the transitions into caregiving have a detrimental effect on health. On the contrary, the transitions out of caregiving have in most cases no beneficial consequences on health. Most importantly, we found evidence supporting differential effects of caregiving transitions by gender and welfare arrangement: the transitions out of caregiving are associated with better health conditions only for Southern and Eastern European women. Our study highlights the asymmetric and gendered nature of care transitions and suggests that the impact of caregiving is somewhat permanent and has long lasting effects for the caregiver.

In this viewpoint, we put forward the hypothesis that disturbances in the process of tissue maintenance are an important common denominator that may lie in between specific hallmarks of ageing (i.e. damage and responses to damage) and their ultimate (patho)physiological consequences (i.e. functional decline and age-related disease). As a first step towards verifying or falsifying this hypothesis, it will be important to measure biomarkers of tissue maintenance in future studies in different study populations. The main aim of the current paper is to discuss potential biomarkers of tissue maintenance that could be used in such future studies. Among the many tissues that could have been chosen to explore our hypothesis, to keep the paper manageable, we chose to focus on a selected number of tissues, namely bone, cartilage, muscle, and the brain, which are important for mobility and cognition and affected in several common age-related diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of potential biomarkers for use in (pre)clinical studies. The proposed biomarkers should be validated in future research, for example by measuring these in humans with different rates of ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, although VDR is expressed in osteoclastogenic cells, the contribution of VDR-mediated signaling to osteoclast differentiation and activity remains undefined. We therefore deleted Vdr expression efficiently and specifically in myeloid cells by use of M lysozyme-driven Cre expression, which targets granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and osteoclasts (Vdr<sup>myel-</sup> mice). Bone and calcium homeostasis were investigated under basal conditions and in conditions of increased bone remodeling, by feeding Vdr<sup>myel-</sup> and Vdr<sup>myel+</sup> (wildtype) mice either a normal (1%) or a low (0.02%) calcium diet from weaning onwards. Vdr<sup>myel-</sup> mice developed normally and were normocalcemic at the age of 8 weeks, both at the normal and the low calcium diet. No differences in trabecular or cortical bone mass were observed between Vdr<sup>myel-</sup> mice and their wildtype littermates. Dietary calcium restriction resulted in a comparable reduction of trabecular bone mass (40%) and cortical thickness (48%) in Vdr<sup>myel-</sup> and Vdr<sup>myel+</sup> mice, pointing to a massive transfer of calcium from the bone to the serum. In agreement with these results, osteoclastic differentiation of hematopoietic cells of Vdr<sup>myel-</sup> mice, either induced by M-CSF and RANKL, or cocultured with osteoblasts, occurred as efficiently as osteoclastogenesis from Vdr<sup>myel+</sup> mice. In conclusion, our data do not support a role for osteoclastic Vdr signaling in the control of bone homeostasis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the advantages they possess is their ability to be disassociated under in vitro rearing conditions. Various in vitro methods have been developed to produce symbiont colonized and aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) nematodes. Until now, there has been no investigation on how in vitro rearing conditions may have an impact on the storage ability and the protein content of the infective juvenile at different storage temperatures. Thus, in this study, we investigated how infective juvenile longevity and protein content are impacted when the nematodes were reared with two in vitro methods (lipid and liver kidney agar) considering colonized and uncolonized nematodes, and under two different temperatures: 15 °C and 20 °C (mild stress). Infective juveniles reared in vitro (with or without their symbionts) had lower 8-week survival rates. No in vitro reared, colonized IJs survived to the desired 16-week time point. Survival of infective juveniles stored under mild stress temperature (20 °C) was lower than that observed at 15 °C. However, when comparing the interaction between rearing condition and storage temperature, there were not significant differences. With respect to protein content, in vivo, colonized infective juveniles maintained a static protein content over time, suggesting symbiont colonization may influence protein metabolism and/or turnover in infective juveniles.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Given that current treatments do not produce the desired therapeutic effects, the need for finding alternative biological and pharmacological approaches is critical. Accumulating evidence suggests inflammatory and oxidative stress responses as potential causal factors of cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease and healthy aging. Curcumin has received increased interest due to its unique molecular structure that targets inflammatory and antioxidant pathways as well as (directly) amyloid aggregation; one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this review summarizes preclinical and clinical findings on curcumin as a potential cognitive enhancer in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. Databases used for literature searches include PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science; in addition, clinicaltrials.gov was used to search for clinical studies. Overall, animal research has shown very promising results in potentiating cognition, both physiologically and behaviourally. However, human studies are limited and results are less consistent, complicating their interpretation. These inconsistencies may be related to differences in methodology and the included population. Taking into account measurements of important inflammatory and antioxidant biomarkers, optimal dosages of curcumin, food interactions, and duration of treatment would increase our understanding on curcumin's promising effects on cognition. In addition, increasing curcumin's bioavailability could benefit future research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Instead, various equations have been proposed to predict ME content, but no single method is universally recommended. Data from canine and feline feeding studies, conducted according to Association of American Feed Control Officials recommendations, over a 6-year period at a single research site, were utilised to determine the performance of different predictive equations. Predictive equations tested included the modified Atwater (MA equation), NRC 2006 equations using both crude fibre (NRC 2006cf) and total dietary fibre (NRC 2006tdf), and new equations reported in the most recent study assessing ME predictive equations (Hall equations; PLoS ONE 8(1): e54405). Where appropriate, equations were tested using both predicted gross energy (GE) and GE measured by bomb calorimetry. Associations between measured and predicted ME were compared with Deming regression, whilst agreement was assessed with Bland-Altman plots. 335 feeding trials were included, comprising 207 canine (182 dry food; 25 wet food) and 128 feline trials (104 dry food, 24 wet food). Predicted ME was positively associated with measured ME whatever the equation used (P&lt;0.001 for all). Agreement between predicted and actual ME was worst for the MA equation, for all food types, with evidence of both a systematic bias and proportional errors evident for all food types. The NRC 2006cf and Hall equations were intermediate in performance, whilst the NRC 2006tdf equations performed best especially when using measured rather than predicted GE, with the narrowest 95% limits of agreement, minimal bias and proportional error. In conclusion, when predicting ME content of pet food, veterinarians, nutritionists, pet food manufacturers and regulatory bodies are strongly advised to use the NRC 2006tdf equations and using measured rather than predicted GE.</AbstractText>"}

As neuregulin 1 (NRG1, or heregulin 1), a growth factor with versatile functions in the central nervous system, has demonstrated protective effects against ischemic brain injuries, we have generated NRG1-overexpressing AdMSCs in order to investigate whether NRG1-AdMSCs could enhance therapeutic benefits of AdMSCs in ischemic stroke. After AdMSCs were infected with adenoviral NRG1, increased NRG1 secretion in NRG1-AdMSCs was confirmed with ELISA. At 1 d after ischemic stroke that was induced by the occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAo) for 60 min in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, adenoviral NRG1, AdMSCs, NRG1-AdMSCs, or PBS were injected into the striatum and serial neurologic examinations were performed. Administration of NRG1-AdMSCs resulted in significant improvement of functional outcome following stroke compared to AdMSCs- or adenoviral NRG1-treated group, in addition to the reduction in the infarct size evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. When NRG1 expression in the brain was examined by double immunofluorescence to human nuclei (HuNu)/NRG1 and ELISA, NRG1-AdMSCs demonstrated marked increase in NRG1 expression. Moreover, western blot analysis further showed that transplantation of NRG1-AdMSCs significantly increased both endogenous and adenoviral NRG1 expression compared to AdMSCs-treated group. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, NRG1-associated downstream molecules were evaluated by western blot analysis. Expression of ErbB4, a receptor for NRG1, was markedly increased by NRG1-AdMSCs administration, in addition to pMAPK and pAkt, crucial molecules of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that NRG1-AdMSCs can provide excellent therapeutic potential in ischemic stroke by activating NRG1-ErbB4 signaling network.</AbstractText>"}

The study of age-related changes, which take place in the aging body, the peculiarities of the course of diseases in the elderly and senile age, and prevention methods are becoming more urgent and therefore substantiates the necessity and timeliness of this research. Specialized studies of Latin and Greek terminology in this field of medical science have not been performed yet, which determines the scientific novelty of this paper. The research material relies on the authoritative encyclopedic and etymological dictionaries, using the method of continuous sampling with a semantic criterion. The frequency of using the Greek initial term elements ger-/geront- and presby- as components of single-word composites has been considered. The compositional models of several gerontological terms and grammatical means of their expression have been analyzed. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the study of trends and principles of the formation of Latin medical terms, the mechanisms of their functioning, semantic features in synchronous and diachronic aspects makes it possible to trace the main stages of development of medical science and contributes to the standardization of the sublanguage of medicine.</AbstractText>"}

Among FDA-approved adjuvants, aluminum salts are most commonly used in vaccines. Although aluminum salts enhance humoral immunity, they show a limited effect for cell-mediated immune responses. Thus, further development of adjuvants that induce T-cell-mediated immune response is needed. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate innate immunity, which is crucial to shape adaptive immunity. Using TLR ligands as novel adjuvants in vaccines has therefore attracted substantial attention. Among them a small molecule TLR7 ligand, imiquimod, has been approved for clinical use, but its use is restricted to local administration due to unwanted adverse side effects when used systematically. Since TLR7 is mainly located in the endosomal compartment of immune cells, efficient transport of the ligand into the cells is important for improving the potency of the TLR7 ligand. In this study we examined gold nanoparticles (GNPs) immobilized with α-mannose as carriers for a TLR7 ligand to target immune cells. The small molecule synthetic TLR7 ligand, 2-methoxyethoxy-8-oxo-9-(4-carboxy benzyl)adenine (1V209), and α-mannose were coimmobilized via linker molecules consisting of thioctic acid on the GNP surface (1V209-αMan-GNPs). The in vitro cytokine production activity of 1V209-αMan-GNPs was higher than that of the unconjugated 1V209 derivative in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the in vivo immunization study, 1V209-αMan-GNPs induced significantly higher titers of IgG2c antibody specific to ovalbumin as an antigen than did unconjugated 1V209, and splenomegaly and weight loss were not observed. These results indicate that 1V209-αMan-GNPs could be useful as safe and effective adjuvants for development of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.</AbstractText>"}

In the short term, maternal diet is important for the growth and development of the fetus; however, it may also have long-term effects on the health status of the offspring. Here, we investigate the effect that maternal high-fat diet during gestation has on brain health of the offspring later in life. B6129SF2/J dams were fed a high-fat diet during the 3 weeks' gestation, then switched to standard chow diet after delivery. Offspring were always fed regular diet for the entire study and assessed in learning, memory, and brain pathology when 18 months old. Compared with offspring from control mothers, the ones from mothers exposed to high-fat diet had significant better performance in learning and memory tests, which associated with an amelioration of synaptic integrity. Additionally, they had a significant reduction in total tau, a decrease in its pathological conformational changes and lower levels of caspase-3-cleaved isoforms. Our findings demonstrate that in utero exposure to high-fat diet plays a protective role for offspring brain health later in life. They support the novel hypothesis that targeted dietary intervention specifically restricted to the gestation period could be implemented as preventative strategy for the age-dependent decline in brain health.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

We explored the DNA methylation changes in a variety of retroelement families throughout aging (at 2, 20, and 28 months of age) in murine skeletal muscles by methyl-binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq). The two following contrasting patterns were observed among the members of each repeat family in superaged mice: (a) hypermethylation in weakly methylated retroelement copies and (b) hypomethylation in copies with relatively stronger methylation levels, representing a pattern of 'regression toward the mean' within a single retroelement family. Interestingly, these patterns depended on the sizes of the copies. While the majority of the elements showed a slight increase in methylation, the larger copies (&gt;5 kb) displayed evident demethylation. All these changes were not observed in T cells. RNA sequencing revealed a global derepression of retroelements during the late phase of aging (between 20 and 28 months of age), which temporally coincided with retroelement demethylation. Following this methylation drift trend of 'regression toward the mean,' aging tended to progressively lose the preexisting methylation differences and local patterns in the genomic regions that had been elaborately established during the early period of development.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Indeed, a plethora of dietary, pharmacological, genetic, and surgical lipid-related interventions extend lifespan in nematodes, fruit flies, mice, and rats. For example, the impairment of genes involved in ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis extends lifespan in both worms and flies. The overexpression of fatty acid amide hydrolase or lysosomal lipase prolongs life in Caenorhabditis elegans, while the overexpression of diacylglycerol lipase enhances longevity in both C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The surgical removal of adipose tissue extends lifespan in rats, and increased expression of apolipoprotein D enhances survival in both flies and mice. Mouse lifespan can be additionally extended by the genetic deletion of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, treatment with the steroid 17-α-estradiol, or a ketogenic diet. Moreover, deletion of the phospholipase A2 receptor improves various healthspan parameters in a progeria mouse model. Genome-wide association studies have found several lipid-related variants to be associated with human aging. For example, the epsilon 2 and epsilon 4 alleles of apolipoprotein E are associated with extreme longevity and late-onset neurodegenerative disease, respectively. In humans, blood triglyceride levels tend to increase, while blood lysophosphatidylcholine levels tend to decrease with age. Specific sphingolipid and phospholipid blood profiles have also been shown to change with age and are associated with exceptional human longevity. These data suggest that lipid-related interventions may improve human healthspan and that blood lipids likely represent a rich source of human aging biomarkers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Evidence suggests that environmental factors may contribute to AD. Notably, dietary nutrients are suggested to play a key role in mediating mechanisms associated with brain function. Choline is a B-like vitamin nutrient found in common foods that is important in various cell functions. It serves as a methyl donor and as a precursor for production of cell membranes. Choline is also the precursor for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter which activates the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR), and also acts as an agonist for the Sigma-1 R (σ1R). These receptors regulate CNS immune response, and their dysregulation contributes to AD pathogenesis. Here, we tested whether dietary choline supplementation throughout life reduces AD-like pathology and rescues memory deficits in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. We exposed female APP/PS1 and NonTg mice to either a control choline (1.1 g/kg choline chloride) or a choline-supplemented diet (5.0 g/kg choline chloride) from 2.5 to 10 months of age. Mice were tested in the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory followed by neuropathological evaluation. Lifelong choline supplementation significantly reduced amyloid-β plaque load and improved spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, these changes were linked to a decrease of the amyloidogenic processing of APP, reductions in disease-associated microglial activation, and a downregulation of the α7nAch and σ1 receptors. Our results demonstrate that lifelong choline supplementation produces profound benefits and suggest that simply modifying diet throughout life may reduce AD pathology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Using GTEx and TCGA data, we compared genes differentially expressed with age and genes differentially expressed in cancer among nine human tissues. In most tissues, aging and cancer gene expression pattern changed in the opposite direction. The exception was thyroid and uterus, where we found transcriptomic changes in the same direction in aging and in their corresponding cancers. The overlapping sets between genes differentially expressed with age and genes differentially expressed in cancer across tissues were enriched for several processes, mainly cell cycle and the immune system. Moreover, cellular senescence signatures, derived from a meta-analysis, changed in the same direction as aging in human tissues and in the opposite direction of cancer signatures. Therefore, transcriptomic changes in aging and in cellular senescence might relate to a decrease in cell proliferation, while cancer transcriptomic changes shift toward enhanced cell division. Our results highlight the complex relationship between aging and cancer and suggest that, while in general aging processes might be opposite to cancer, the transcriptomic links between human aging and cancer are tissue-specific.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Clinical biochemical measurements showed severe vitamin D deficiency and mild hypocalcaemia. Secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of an inappropriately normal phosphate suggested concurrent renal bone disease. Biomarkers of bone turnover were also consistent with bone remodelling. The history of prior fragility fractures, severe vitamin D deficiency and immobility supports a diagnosis of osteoporotic fracture, however other causes of spontaneous fracture were also considered.

The experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions inside a growth chamber, which was set at 27 ± 2°C, 50 ± 5% relative humidity with a 16 h day length. Our results showed an increase in plant resistance due to the higher immature mortality rates, longer immature periods, lower longevity of adults, and fecundity. In free-choice situation, oviposition on root jasmonic acid (RJA) + N. tenuis and root abscisic acid (RABA) + N. tenuis was similar, but numbers of eggs deposited on these plants were lower than other treatments and control plants. The plant enzyme activity and phenolic content were significantly greater in RJA + N. tenuis and RABA + N. tenuis, intermediate in individual treatments, and the lowest in control plants. Correspondingly, T. vaporariorum longevity, number of eggs produced per female, oviposition preference, all were lowest when the insects fed on these treatments. These findings suggest that the induction of resistance in eggplants with the physiological changes in the host plant leads to a reduction in whitefly damage.</AbstractText>"}

In this context, the cognitive health of HIV infection needs to have methods for monitoring over time, in order to better anticipate HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) trajectories in relation to biomarkers, and predict prognosis and especially the risk of dementia as People Living with HIV (PLHIV) age. In this chapter, we critically review several statistical frameworks to quantify cognitive change. We then provide a critical review of naturalistic longitudinal studies and selected randomized clinical trials assessing neurocognitive change as a primary outcome in PLHIV, conducted since the advent of the combined antiretroviral therapy era (censored January 2019). Doing so, we distinguish between PLHIV who were treated early and did not experience AIDS (CDC 1993), versus treated late, after experiencing AIDS and more severe immune compromise. Highlighting strengths and limitations of these studies, we emphasize that issues of reliability pertaining to the use of neuropsychological tests need careful consideration for the robust quantification of cognitive change, including measurement error, practice effect, inter-individual variability, baseline level of functioning, demographic effects, timeframe between testing intervals, normative longitudinal data, and operationalization of clinically meaningful neurocognitive change. In addition, issues pertaining to longitudinal analyses including type, amount and pattern of missing data and/or participant attrition, regression toward the mean, and survivor bias need to be properly addressed. We conclude by proposing future research directions with emphasis on research translation to clinical participants.</AbstractText>"}

Given the key role of the hippocampus in encoding, storage, and retrieval of memory, the morpho- and electrophysiological alterations that occur in the major synapse of this network-the glutamatergic-deserve special attention. We guide you through the hippocampal anatomy, circuitry, and function in physiological context and focus on alterations in neuronal morphology, calcium dynamics, and plasticity induced by aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We provide state-of-the art knowledge on glutamatergic transmission and discuss implications of these novel players for intervention. A link between regular consumption of caffeine-an adenosine receptor blocker-to decreased risk of AD in humans is well established, while the mechanisms responsible have only now been uncovered. We review compelling evidence from humans and animal models that implicate adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R) upsurge as a crucial mediator of age-related synaptic dysfunction. The relevance of this mechanism in patients was very recently demonstrated in the form of a significant association of the A<sub>2A</sub>R-encoding gene with hippocampal volume (synaptic loss) in mild cognitive impairment and AD. Novel pathways implicate A<sub>2A</sub>R in the control of mGluR5-dependent NMDAR activation and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysfunction upon aging. The nature of this receptor makes it particularly suited for long-term therapies, as an alternative for regulating aberrant mGluR5/NMDAR signaling in aging and disease, without disrupting their crucial constitutive activity.</AbstractText>"}

However, at the same time intrinsic brittleness has been their main drawback, which severely restricts many applications. Despite much progress, a breakthrough in developing ultra-damage-resistant and ductile oxide glasses still needs to be made. Here, a critical advancement toward such oxide glasses is presented. In detail, a bulk oxide glass with a record-high crack resistance is obtained by subjecting a caesium aluminoborate glass to surface aging under humid conditions, enabling it to sustain sharp contact deformations under loads of ≈500 N without forming any strength-limiting cracks. This ultra-high crack resistance exceeds that of the annealed oxide glasses by more than one order of magnitude, making this glass micro-ductile. In addition, a remarkable indentation behavior, i.e., a time-dependent shrinkage of the indent cavity, is demonstrated. Based on structural analyses, a molecular-scale deformation model to account for both the ultra-high crack resistance and the time-dependent shrinkage in the studied glass is proposed.</AbstractText>"}

Molecular cell biology","Date":"Dec 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The spatiotemporal control of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated gene transcription is tightly and intricately regulated. In addition, preservation of the integrity of the DNA template is required so as to ensure unperturbed transcription, particularly since DNA is continually challenged by different types of damaging agents that can form transcription-blocking DNA lesions (TBLs), which impede transcription elongation and cause transcription stress. To overcome the highly cytotoxic effects of TBLs, an intricate cellular response has evolved, in which the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway has a central role in removing TBLs specifically from the transcribed strand. Damage detection by stalling of the transcribing Pol II is highly efficient, but a stalled Pol II complex may create an even bigger problem by interfering with repair of the lesions, and overall with transcription and replication. In this Review, we discuss the effects of different types of DNA damage on Pol II, important concepts of transcription stress, the manner in which TBLs are removed by TC-NER and how different tissues respond to TBLs. We also discuss the role of TBLs in ageing and the complex genotype-phenotype correlations of TC-NER hereditary disorders.</AbstractText>"}

In other words, actions that solicit salient information cause the greatest shift in beliefs (i.e., information gain) about the causes of our sensations. However, not all information is relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal model of selective attention based on active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant exploration. In this scheme, attention modulates the expected fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner. This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain, and so the agent - driven to reduce expected surprise (i.e., uncertainty) - does not actively seek them out. Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in conditions such as autism and anxiety may be due to a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way.</AbstractText>"}

Telomere shortening during cell division restricts cellular proliferative capacity and leads to cellular senescence when critically shortened telomere lengths are reached.

However, this compensation for telomere loss by telomerase in T cells is imperfect or limited, as shortening of T cell telomeres is observed in human aging and during in vitro longterm culture. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the expression and regulation of telomerase in human T cells and changes of telomerase expression during development, activation, differentiation, aging and disease conditions.

According to past research, relative to young adults, older adults are more likely to hyper-bind extraneous co-occurrences and tend to prioritise positive over negative information. However, the interaction of these cognitive and emotional processes is unknown. The current study thus examined the influence of emotion on age-related hyper-binding. Participants completed a 1-back task for neutral target pictures paired with positive, negative, or neutral distractor words. After a delay, participants completed a paired-associate learning task for pairs that were either preserved or disrupted from the 1-back task, followed by a cued-recall test for those pairs. Compared to young adults, older adults showed better recall of preserved neutral pairs relative to disrupted neutral pairs, replicating the age-related hyper-binding effect. Interestingly, whereas older adults did not hyper-bind emotional pairs, young adults showed hyper-binding of negative pairs, but not positive or neutral. This implies that young adults may also implicitly bind irrelevant co-occurrences when they include negative information. Consistent with a negativity bias in youth, negative words may have captured young adults' attention, facilitating binding of pairs. These findings highlight the need to consider emotional effects on age differences in cognitive processing.</AbstractText>"}

In 181 memory clinic patients (mean age 72 ± 9 years, 51% male), CMI presence was rated on 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cerebral perfusion was assessed from cortical gray matter of the anterior circulation using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling parameters <i>cerebral blood flow</i> (CBF) (perfusion in mL blood/100 g tissue/min) and <i>spatial coefficient of variation</i> (CoV) (reflecting arterial transit time (ATT)). Patients with CMIs had a 12% lower CBF (beta = -.20) and 22% higher spatial CoV (beta = .20) (both <i>p</i> &lt; .05) without a specific regional pattern on voxel-based CBF analysis. CBF in a 2 cm region-of-interest around the CMIs did not differ from CBF in a reference zone in the contralateral hemisphere. These findings show that CMIs in memory clinic patients are primarily related to global reductions in cerebral perfusion, thus shedding new light on the etiology of vascular brain injury in dementia.</AbstractText>"}

However, there is a paucity of research exploring patient perceptions of the dentist in China. One reason for this may be the lack of a valid and reliable scale in Chinese (Standard Mandarin) to measure this. This study aimed to translate the Revised Dental Beliefs Survey (DBS-R) into Chinese and then explore the reliability and validity of this measure (both the short and longer versions) in a Chinese population. We translated the DBS-R using the forwards-backwards method and pilot tested it on a small sample of adults in China. Following this, 480 Chinese adults completed the newly translated scale, as well as well as a standardised dental anxiety questionnaire (the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale Chinese version) to test convergent validity. 109 participants completed the DBS-R again 2 weeks later for test-retest reliability. Both versions of the Chinese DBS-R were internally consistent and demonstrated convergent validity; test-retest reliability was also good. Both versions of the scale performed similarly, but for now we would suggest the 28-item version may be superior as items relating to the technical competence of the dentist appear important to Chinese adults.</AbstractText>"}

The purpose of anti-aging medicine is to slow, stop, or reverse the aging process and its associated effects, such as disability and frailty. Anti-aging medicine is emerging as a growing industry, but many supplements or protocols are available that do not have scientific evidence to support their claims. In this review, the mechanisms of action and the clinical implications of anti-aging interventions were examined and explained. Calorie restriction mimetics define compounds that imitate the outcome of calorie restriction, including an activator of AMP protein kinase (metformin), inhibitor of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis (pegvisomant), inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin), and activator of the sirtuin pathway (resveratrol). Hormonal replacement has also been widely used in the elderly population to improve their quality of life. Manipulating healthy gut microbiota through prebiotic/probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation has significant potential in anti-aging medicine. Vitamin D is expected to be a primary anti-aging medicine in the near future due to its numerous positive effects in the elderly population.</AbstractText>"}

Alveolar abnormalities leading to emphysema are a key characteristic of COPD. Pulmonary alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2) produce surfactant and function as progenitors for type 1 cells. Increasing evidence shows elevated WNT-5A/B expression in ageing and in COPD that may contribute to the disease process. However, supportive roles for WNT-5A/B in lung regeneration were also reported in different studies. Thus, we explored the role of WNT-5A/B on alveolar epithelial progenitors (AEPs) in more detail. We established a Precision-Cut-Lung Slices (PCLS) model and a lung organoid model by co-culturing epithelial cells (EpCAM<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup>) with fibroblasts in matrigel in vitro to study the impact of WNT-5A and WNT-5B. Our results show that WNT-5A and WNT-5B repress the growth of epithelial progenitors with WNT-5B preferentially restraining the growth and differentiation of alveolar epithelial progenitors. We provide evidence that both WNT-5A and WNT-5B negatively regulate the canonical WNT signaling pathway in alveolar epithelium. Taken together, these findings reveal the functional impact of WNT-5A/5B signaling on alveolar epithelial progenitors in the lung, which may contribute to defective alveolar repair in COPD.</AbstractText>"}

This systematic review evaluates the beneficial effects of video gaming on neuroplasticity specifically on intervention studies. Literature research was conducted from randomized controlled trials in PubMed and Google Scholar published after 2000. A systematic review was written instead of a meta-analytic review because of variations among participants, video games, and outcomes. Nine scientific articles were eligible for the review. Overall, the eligible articles showed fair quality according to Delphi Criteria. Video gaming affects the brain structure and function depending on how the game is played. The game genres examined were 3D adventure, first-person shooting (FPS), puzzle, rhythm dance, and strategy. The total training durations were 16-90 h. Results of this systematic review demonstrated that video gaming can be beneficial to the brain. However, the beneficial effects vary among video game types.</AbstractText>"}

The New Rural Pension System (NRPS), a pilot project that provided basic security for the elderly, was implemented in 10% of counties in 2009 and rapidly promoted nationwide in China. This study evaluates the impact of NRPS on farmland transfer by developing econometric models by employing the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2015. The participation rate in NRPS increased from 25.87% in 2011 to 80.85% in 2015, and the participation rate in farmland transfer rose from 11.56% to 24.04%. Everything else being held equal, the probability of farmers who transferred out their land increased by approximately 13% and the land area has been transferred increased by 11.2% due to participation in NRPS, indicating that the NRPS improved the operation efficiency of land rental market. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis showed that the probability and area mentioned above had a significant upward trend with the increase of the time and insured amount of participation in NRPS, which reduced dependence on farmland for the elderly and promoted the sustainability of land transfer. The government should further encourage farmers to increase the coverage and insured amount of pension system in the context of aging. Meanwhile, a platform to promote land transfer should be established to provide information about land supply and demand and reduce the transaction cost of land rental market.</AbstractText>"}

Depression was measured as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scores in 2012. It was examined whether income volatility was related to depressive symptoms, and whether the association depended on co-residence with children. In results, income volatility was not related to CES-D scores in main-effect models without an interaction term. The relationship between income volatility and depressive symptoms depended on co-residence with children (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

Among those, the most studied are SIRT1 and SIRT3, a nuclear SIRT and a mitochondrial SIRT, respectively, which significantly impact with an increase in mammals' lifespan by modulating metabolic cellular processes. Particularly, when activated, both SIRT1 and 3 enhance pancreatic β-cells' insulin release and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress pancreatic damage, maintaining then glucose homeostasis. Therefore, SIRT1 and 3 activators have been proposed to prevent and counteract metabolic age-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Physical activity (PA) has a well-established beneficial effect on phenotypes of aging like β-cell dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. Recent experimental and clinical evidence reports that PA increases the expression levels of both SIRT1 and 3, suggesting that PA may exert its healthy contribute even by activating SIRTs. Therefore, in the present article, we discuss the role of SIRT1, SIRT3, and PA on β-cell function and on diabetes. We also discuss the possible interaction between PA and activation of SIRTs as a possible therapeutic strategy to maintain glucose hemostasis and to prevent T2DM and its complications, especially in the elderly population.</AbstractText>"}

SELENBP1 is associated with cellular redox and thiol homeostasis in several respects, including its established role as a methanethiol oxidase that is involved in degradation of methanethiol, a methionine catabolite, generating hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). As both H<sub>2</sub>S and reactive oxygen species (such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are major regulators of Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and stress resistance, we hypothesized that a SELENBP1 ortholog in C. elegans would likely be involved in regulating these aspects. Here we characterize Y37A1B.5, a putative selenium-binding protein 1 ortholog in C. elegans with 52% primary structure identity to human SELENBP1. While conferring resistance to toxic concentrations of selenite, Y37A1B.5 also attenuates resistance to oxidative stress and lowers C. elegans lifespan: knockdown of Y37A1B.5 using RNA interference resulted in an approx. 10% increase of C. elegans lifespan and an enhanced resistance against the redox cycler paraquat, as well as enhanced motility. Analyses of transgenic reporter strains suggest hypodermal expression and cytoplasmic localization of Y37A1B.5, whose expression decreases with worm age. We identify the transcriptional coregulator MDT-15 and transcription factor EGL-27 as regulators of Y37A1B.5 levels and show that the lifespan extending effect elicited by downregulation of Y37A1B.5 is independent of known MDT-15 interacting factors, such as DAF-16 and NHR-49. In summary, Y37A1B.5 is an ortholog of SELENBP1 that shortens C. elegans lifespan and lowers resistance against oxidative stress, while allowing for a better survival under toxic selenite concentrations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Little is known about possible heterogeneity in this context and the extent to which wellbeing measures cover the aspects of wellbeing that are most important to older people with different views on wellbeing. We conducted a Q-methodology study between December 2016 and October 2017 to investigate the variety in views among people aged 65 and older in the Netherlands on what is important to their wellbeing. A purposive sample of 53 respondents ranked 34 opinion statements according to importance to their wellbeing and explained their ranking during a follow-up interview.

Five distinct views were extracted in which different aspects were considered important: (I) health, financial security and a life partner; (II) family, support and physical functioning (III); autonomy, mental health and helping others; (IV) social contacts, support, mental health and religion; and (V) a life partner, social contacts, living environment and adaptation. This heterogeneity in views of older people on what constitutes wellbeing supports the use of person-centered approaches in care services for older people.

However, the hypertrophic response to PRT is variable, and this may be due to muscle inflammation susceptibility. Metformin reduces inflammation, so we hypothesized that metformin would augment the muscle response to PRT in healthy women and men aged 65 and older. In a randomized, double-blind trial, participants received 1,700 mg/day metformin (N = 46) or placebo (N = 48) throughout the study, and all subjects performed 14 weeks of supervised PRT. Although responses to PRT varied, placebo gained more lean body mass (p = .003) and thigh muscle mass (p &lt; .001) than metformin. CT scan showed that increases in thigh muscle area (p = .005) and density (p = .020) were greater in placebo versus metformin. There was a trend for blunted strength gains in metformin that did not reach statistical significance. Analyses of vastus lateralis muscle biopsies showed that metformin did not affect fiber hypertrophy, or increases in satellite cell or macrophage abundance with PRT. However, placebo had decreased type I fiber percentage while metformin did not (p = .007). Metformin led to an increase in AMPK signaling, and a trend for blunted increases in mTORC1 signaling in response to PRT. These results underscore the benefits of PRT in older adults, but metformin negatively impacts the hypertrophic response to resistance training in healthy older individuals.

The most frequently utilized methods to age bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) include tooth extraction; counting dental growth layer groups and dental radiography. These methods are inaccurate in dolphins &gt; 13 years old, due to overlapping of the growth layer groups in dolphins and worn teeth. Establishing a non-invasive method of accurately aging bottlenose dolphins across the entire age range is important to long term conservation efforts to understand health status, lifespan, reproduction and survivability. A database of 126 radiographs from 94 dolphins of known chronological age was utilized to establish the stages of skeletal ossification over time. A numerical score from -1 to 8 was assigned to 16 anatomic locations on the pectoral radiograph, to create a formula to estimate age. The most informative areas to evaluate morphologically were the metaphyseal regions of the radius and ulna, and the proximal and distal epiphysis of metacarpals II and III. Third order polynomial regression calculated separate age predictor formulas for male and female dolphins, with females reaching sexual maturity earlier than males. Completion of epiphyseal closure of the long bones correlated with average sexual maturity. Managed care dolphin ages could be properly estimated with decreasing precision from within 3 months in animals &lt; 5 years old, to within 5 years in animals &gt; 30 years old. This diagnostic tool could also be applied to diagnose atypical ossification patterns consistent with nutritional, developmental or growth abnormalities, and identifying subclinical health issues. In conclusion, knowledge of the lifespan and the onset of sexual maturity for each species will allow this model to be applied to other cetaceans, facilitating age estimation via pectoral radiography in future research.</AbstractText>"}

The direction and degree of changes observed in aging are often region or cell specific, hampering the generalization of age-related effects. Using real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, we investigated age-related changes in several presynaptic markers (Vglut1, Vglut2, Gad65, Gad67, Vgat, synaptophysin) involved in the initial steps of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, in several cortical regions, in young (3-4 months old), middle-aged (1 year old), and old (2 years old) mice. We found age-related changes mainly in protein levels while, apart from the occipital cortex, virtually no significant changes in mRNA levels were detected, which suggests that aging acts on the investigated markers mainly through post-transcriptional mechanisms depending on the brain region. Principal component analysis (PCA) of protein data revealed that each brain region possessed a type of 'biochemical distinctiveness' (each analyzed brain region was best characterized by higher variability level of a particular synaptic marker) that was lost with age. Analysis of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in aging suggested that mechanisms keeping an overall balance between the two amino acids in the brain are weakened in the hippocampus.

Much of the increased risk of CVD in this population is attributable to CV dysfunction, including adverse changes in the structure and function of the heart, increased systolic blood pressure, and arterial dysfunction. The latter is characterized by increased arterial stiffness and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Conventional aerobic exercise training, as generally recommended in public health guidelines, is an effective strategy to preserve or improve CV function with aging. However, &lt;40% of midlife and older adults meet aerobic exercise guidelines, due in part to time availability-related barriers. As such, there is a need to develop evidence-based time-efficient exercise interventions that promote adherence and optimize CV function in these groups. Two promising interventions that may meet these criteria are interval training and inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST). Limited research suggests these modes of training may improve CV function with time commitments of ≤60 min/wk. This review will summarize the current evidence for interval training and IMST to improve CV function in midlife/older adults and identify key research gaps and future directions.</AbstractText>"}

In the light of recent evidence, this review reconsiders these risk factors, identifies those currently regarded as important, and discusses various hypotheses to explain how they may cause AD. Rare forms of early-onset familial AD (EO-FAD) are strongly linked to causal gene mutations, viz. mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PSEN1/2) genes. By contrast, late-onset sporadic AD (LO-SAD) is a multifactorial disorder in which age-related changes, genetic risk factors, such as allelic variation in apolipoprotein E (Apo E) and many other genes, vascular disease, TBI and risk factors associated with diet, the immune system, mitochondrial function, metal exposure, and infection are all implicated. These risk factors may act collectively to cause AD pathology: 1) by promoting the liberation of oxygen free radicals with age, 2) via environmental stress acting on regulatory genes early and later in life ('dual hit' hypothesis), or 3) by increasing the cumulative 'allostatic load' on the body over a lifetime. As a consequence, life-style changes which reduce the impact of these factors may be necessary to lower the risk of AD.</AbstractText>"}

AD was always related to ageing though there have been instances where people at an early age also succumb to this disease. With medical advancements, the mortality rate has significantly reduced which also makes people more prone to AD. AD is rare, yet the prominent disease has been widely studied with several hypotheses trying to understand the workings of its onset. The most recent and popular hypothesis in AD is the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium homeostasis in the development of the disease though their exact roles are not known. With the sudden advent of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), many previously known pathological hallmarks of AD may be better understood. Several studies have shown the effect of excess calcium in mitochondria and the influence of MCU complex in mitochondrial function. In this article, we discuss the possible involvement of MCU in AD by linking the uniporter to mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium homeostasis, reactive oxygen species, neurotransmitters and the hallmarks of AD - amyloid plaque formation and tau tangle formation.</AbstractText>"}

Over the past 10 years, there has been a change in the demographics of end-stage renal disease patients. Aging population and the increase in prevalence of diabetes mellitus has led to the acceleration of chronic kidney disease and increase in incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease. Vascular access care has, therefore, been more complicated, with the physical, psychological, and social challenges that occur with increased frequency in elderly patients and patients with multiple co-morbidities. Arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft are created by vascular surgeons, while maintenance of patency of vascular access through endovascular intervention has been a shared responsibility between surgeons, interventional radiologists, and interventional nephrologists. Pre-emptive access creation among end-stage renal disease patients has been low, with up to 80% of new end-stage renal disease patients being commenced on hemodialysis via a dialysis catheter. Access creation is exclusively performed by a dedicated vascular surgeon with arteriovenous fistula success rate up to 78%. The primary and cumulative patency rates of arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft were consistent with the results from many international centers. Vascular access surveillance is not universally practiced in all dialysis centers due to its controversies, in addition to the cost and the limited availability of equipment for surveillance. Timely permanent access placement, with reduced dependence on dialysis catheters, and improved vascular access surveillance are the main areas for potential intervention to improve vascular access management.</AbstractText>"}

Ultraviolet-A (UV-A)-mediated stress is a growing health hazard to mankind as it is the major cause of photoaging, which could lead to much damage of skin cells and tissues ranging from tan, burn, or even cancer. The present study focuses on the role of antioxidants and other natural compounds which have been widely used in oral/topical applications to combat and delay the effects of photoaging using model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Compounds like green tea extract, naringenin, and naringin, which are known for their antioxidant properties, were able to extend life span and healthspan of the nematode in normal as well as under UV-A-mediated stress conditions. Regulation of both the stress-responsive genes (skn-1 and sir-2.1) and the aging-regulating genes (daf-2 and age-1) was attributable for these conditions. Interestingly, it was observed that these compounds when combined in equal ratios by weight worked synergistically to combat the aging process. Pronounced synergistic effects were observed during UV-A-mediated stress conditions, suggesting that these could be used as potential antiphotoaging compounds which will be of greater significance for health-based research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society for Photobiology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

SG dynamics are particularly susceptible to the cellular conditions that are commonly induced by aging, including the elevation in reactive oxygen species and increased concentration of aggregate-prone proteins. In turn, the persistent formation of these compartments is hypothesized to serve as a seed for subsequent protein aggregation. Notably, the protein quality control (PQC) machinery responsible for inhibiting persistent SGs (e.g., Hsc70-BAG3) can become compromised with age, suggesting that the modulation of such PQC mechanisms could reliably inhibit pathological processes of ANPs. As exemplified in the context of accelerated aging syndromes (i.e., Hutchinson-Gilford progeria), PQC enhancement is emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy, indicating similar techniques might be applied to ANPs. Collectively, these recent findings advance our understanding of how the processes that might facilitate protein aggregation are particularly susceptible to aging conditions, and present investigators with an opportunity to develop novel targets for ANPs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

On intracranial tumor model gemcitabine (25 mg/kg) increased the life span (ILS) by 60-89% (p&lt;0.001), despite the fact that its permeability of the BBB is about 10%. Therapeutic activity of carmustine, cyclophosphamide and cisplatin (ILS were 44, 22 and 11%, respectively) corresponds with the BBB permeability for these drugs (90, 20 and 8%, respectively).

Although the exact causes have remained elusive, the fact that altered iron levels have been found in disparate diseases suggests that iron may contribute to their development and/or progression. As such, the processes involved in iron dyshomeostasis may represent novel therapeutic targets. There are, however, many questions about the exact interplay between neurodegeneration and altered iron homeostasis. Some insight can be gained by considering the parallels with respect to what occurs in healthy aging, which is also characterized by increased iron throughout many regions in the brain along with progressive neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of iron-mediated damage are likely disease specific to a certain degree, given that iron plays a crucial role in many disparate biological processes, which are not always affected in the same way across different neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, it is not even entirely clear yet whether iron actually has a causative role in all of the diseases where altered iron levels have been noted. For example, there is strong evidence of iron dyshomeostasis leading to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, but there is still some question as to whether changes in iron levels are merely an epiphenomenon in multiple sclerosis. Recent advances in neuroimaging now offer the possibility to detect and monitor iron levels in vivo, which allows for an improved understanding of both the temporal and spatial dynamics of iron changes and associated neurodegeneration compared to post-mortem studies. In this regard, iron-based imaging will likely play an important role in the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing altered iron dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, the bulk of such therapies have focused on chelating excess iron. Although there is some evidence that these treatment options may yield some benefit, they are not without their own limitations. They are generally effective at reducing brain iron levels, as assessed by imaging, but clinical benefits are more modest. New drugs that specifically target iron-related pathological processes may offer the possibility to prevent, or at the least, slow down irreversible neurodegeneration, which represents an unmet therapeutic target.</AbstractText>"}

It has been reported that PRMTs are involved in many metabolic regulatory pathways. However, until now, their roles in adipocyte function, especially browning and thermogenesis, have not been evaluated. Even though Prmt1 adipocyte-specific-deleted mice (Prmt1fl/flAQcre) appeared normal at basal level, following cold exposure or β-adrenergic stimulation, impaired induction of the thermogenic program was observed in both the interscapular brown adipose tissue and inguinal white adipose tissue of Prmt1fl/flAQcre mice compared with littermate controls. Different splicing variants of Prmt1 have been reported. Among them, PRMT1 variant 1 and PRMT1 variant 2 (PRMT1V2) are well conserved between humans and mice. Both variants contribute to the activation of thermogenic fat, with PRMT1V2 playing a more dominant role. Mechanistic studies using cultured murine and human adipocytes revealed that PRMT1V2 mediates thermogenic fat activation through PGC1α, a transcriptional coactivator that has been shown to play a key role in mitochondrial biogenesis. To our knowledge, our data are the first to demonstrate that PRMT1 plays a regulatory role in thermogenic fat function. These findings suggest that modulating PRMT1 activity may represent new avenues to regulate thermogenic fat and mediate energy homeostasis. This function is conserved in human primary adipocytes, suggesting that further investigation of this pathway may ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies against human obesity and associated metabolic disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The risk of T2D increases with age, with the sharpest rise in diagnosis occurring after age 40. With age, there is also a progressive decline in muscle mass starting after the age of 30. The decline in muscle mass and function due to aging is termed sarcopenia and immediately precedes the sharp rise in T2D. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the role of protein to attenuate declines in muscle mass and insulin sensitivity to prevent T2D and sarcopenia in aging adults. The current recommended dietary allowance for protein consumption is set at 0.8 g/kg/day and is based on dated studies on young healthy men and may not be sufficient for older adults. Protein consumption upwards of 1.0-1.5 g/kg/day in older adults is able to induce improvements in glycemic control and muscle mass. Obesity, particularly central or visceral obesity is a major risk factor in the development of PD and T2D. However, the tissue composition of weight loss in older adults includes both lean body mass and fat mass and therefore may have adverse metabolic consequences in older adults who are already at a high risk of lean body mass loss. High protein diets have the ability to increase weight loss while preserving lean body mass therefore inducing 'high-quality weight loss,' which provides favorable metabolic changes in older adults. High protein diets also induce beneficial outcomes on glycemic markers due to satiety, lowered post-prandial glucose response, increased thermogenesis, and the ability to decrease rates of muscle protein breakdown (MPB). The consumption of dairy specific protein consumption has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity by improving body composition, enhancing insulin release, accelerating fat oxidation, and stimulating rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in older adults. Exercise, specifically resistance training, also works synergistically to attenuate the progression of PD and T2D by further stimulating rates of MPS thereby increasing muscle mass and inducing favorable changes in glycemic control independent of lean body mass increases.</AbstractText>"}

There has been a growing interest in shockwave treatment for orthopedic diseases, including KOA. In previous trials, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) was compared to physical therapy or placebo in the treatment of KOA. However, the efficacy and safety of ESWT for KOA remains disputed. The present meta-analysis assessed the effects of ESWT in KOA. The PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Research Gate and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify comparative studies involving ESWT for patients with KOA. The outcome indicators included the visual analog scale (VAS) score, range of motion (ROM), the Lequesne index (LI) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC). In the comparison of the ESWT vs. placebo groups, the primary outcomes included the VAS score and ROM, while the LI was the secondary outcome. In the comparison of the ESWT vs. physical therapy groups, the primary outcomes included the pain score and ROM, while the secondary outcome was the WOMAC index. Relevant data were analyzed using RevMan v5.3. The ESWT group had a lower VAS core, larger ROM and a better LI than the placebo group after 1 month of therapy (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, at 1 month post-therapy, the ESWT group had a lower VAS score, larger ROM and a better WOMAC than the physical therapy group (P&lt;0.05).

Here, we investigated the role of parasite-secreted effectors in regulating host access to parasitophorous vacuole (PV) localized parasite antigens and their presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by the major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) pathway. Antigen presentation of PV localized parasite antigens by MHC-I was significantly increased in macrophages and/or dendritic cells infected with mutant parasites that lacked expression of secreted GRA (GRA2, GRA3, GRA4, GRA5, GRA7, GRA12) or ROP (ROP5, ROP18) effectors. The ability of various secreted GRA or ROP effectors to suppress antigen presentation by MHC-I was dependent on cell type, expression of IFN-γ, or host IRG effectors. The suppression of antigen presentation by ROP5, ROP18, and GRA7 correlated with a role for these molecules in preventing PV disruption by IFN-γ-activated host IRG effectors. However, GRA2 mediated suppression of antigen presentation was not correlated with PV disruption. In addition, the GRA2 antigen presentation phenotypes were strictly co-dependent on the expression of the GRA6 protein. These results show that MHC-I antigen presentation of PV localized parasite antigens was controlled by mechanisms that were dependent or independent of IRG effector mediated PV disruption. Our findings suggest that the GRA6 protein underpins an important mechanism that enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recognition of parasite-infected cells with damaged or ruptured PV membranes.

Here we used a mouse model to address two major questions: (i) is a maturation stimulus needed for tolDC function <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and is maturation required for functioning in experimental arthritis and (ii) can tolDCs modulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses? To answer these questions, we compared matured and immature dexamethasone/vitamin D3-generated tolDCs <i>in vitro</i>. Subsequently, we co-transferred these tolDCs with naïve or effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to study the characteristics of transferred T cells after 3 days with flow cytometry and Luminex multiplex assays.

Participants answered a cognitive complaints questionnaire including two questions directed to language and were classified at baseline as having '<i>Language Complaints</i>' (LC) or '<i>No Language Complaints</i>' (NLC). They also performed a neuropsychological assessment tackling attention/processing speed, memory, executive functioning, and language at baseline. From these, 275 (68.4%) participated in a follow-up evaluation 4.9 (±0.6) years later. At re-evaluation, subjects had a mean age of 70.4 (±8.3) years, 7.5 (±4.4) years of education, and 63.3% were female. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to investigate whether language complaints at baseline predicted poorer language performance at follow-up or increased the risk of cognitive decline, with correction for sex, depressive symptoms, living status, baseline performance, and composite memory and executive performance. Results indicated that LC subjects had significantly worse performances than NLC subjects on semantic fluency 5 years later, but with a similar rate of decline overtime that was not associated with a follow-up outcome of cognitive decline/dementia.

The narrative of social influence during adolescence often revolves around risky and maladaptive decisions, like driving under the influence, and using illegal substances (Steinberg, 2005). However, research has also shown that social influence can lead to increased prosocial behaviors (Van Hoorn et al., 2017) and a reduction in risk-taking (Braams et al., 2019). While many studies support the notion that adolescents are more sensitive to peer influence than children or adults, the developmental processes that underlie this sensitivity remain poorly understood. We argue that one important reason for this lack of understanding is the absence of precisely formulated models. To make a first step toward formal models of social influence during adolescence, we first identify three prominent verbal models of social influence in the literature: (1) social motivation, (2) reward sensitivity, and (3) distraction. We then illustrate how these can be translated into formal models, and how such formal models can inform experimental design and help identify developmental processes. Finally, by applying our formal models to existing datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of formalization by synthesizing different studies with seemingly disparate results. We conclude with a discussion on how formal modeling can be utilized to better investigate the development of peer influence in adolescence.</AbstractText>"}

The present study utilized multiple resting state functional connectivity methods in a sample of adults from 20-80 years old to gain a more complete understanding of the effect of aging on network function and integrity. Whole-brain results showed that aging results in weakening average within-network connectivity, lower system segregation and local efficiency, and higher participation coefficient. Network-level results suggested that nearly every primary sensory and cognitive network faces some degree of age-related decline, including reduced within-network connectivity, higher network-based participation coefficient, and reduced network-level local efficiency. Further, some of these connectivity metrics showed relationships with cognitive performance. Thus, these results suggest that a multi-method analysis of functional connectivity data may be critical to capture the full effect of aging on the health of brain networks.</AbstractText>"}

As life expectancy has significantly increased during the last decades, neurodegenerative diseases became one of the most critical public health problem in our society. The most investigated neurodegenerative diseases during aging are Alzheimer disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The search for biomarkers has been focused so far on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Recently, exosomes emerged as novel biological source with increasing interest for age-related neurodegenerative disease biomarkers. Exosomes are tiny Extracellular vesicles (EVs; 30-100 nm in size) released by all cell types which originate from the endosomal compartment. They constitute important vesicles for the release and transfer of multiple (signaling, toxic, and regulatory) molecules among cells. Initially considered with merely waste disposal function, instead exosomes have been recently recognized as fundamental mediators of intercellular communication. They can move from the site of release by diffusion and be retrieved in several body fluids, where they may dynamically reflect pathological changes of cells present in inaccessible sites such as the brain. Multiple evidence has implicated exosomes in age-associated neurodegenerative processes, which lead to cognitive impairment in later life. Critically, consolidated evidence indicates that pathological protein aggregates, including Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein are released from brain cells in association with exosomes. Importantly, exosomes act as vehicles between cells not only of proteins but also of nucleic acids [DNA, mRNA transcripts, miRNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)] thus potentially influencing gene expression in target cells. In this framework, exosomes could contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underneath neurodegenerative diseases and could represent a promising source of biomarkers. Despite the involvement of exosomes in age-associated neurodegeneration, the study of exosomes and their genetic cargo in physiological aging and in neurodegenerative diseases is still in its infancy. Here, we review, the current knowledge on protein and ncRNAs cargo of exosomes in normal aging and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

The rhesus macaque is the gold standard for modeling viral infection and activation of CNS, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We have developed a rhesus macaque choroid plexus epithelial cell culture model which we believe to be suitable for studies of inflammation associated with viral infection of the CNS. Epithelial morphology and function were assessed using vimentin, phalloidin, the tight junction protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Choroid plexus epithelial cell type was confirmed using immunofluorescence with two proteins highly expressed in the choroid plexus: transthyretin and α-klotho. Finally, barrier properties of the model were monitored using pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, the TLR2 agonist PamCys3K, and dexamethasone). When pro-inflammatory TNF-α was added to the xCelligence wells, there was a decrease in barrier function, which decreased in a step-wise fashion with each additional administration. This barrier function was repaired upon addition of the steroid dexamethasone. The TLR2 agonist PAM3CysK increased barrier functions in TNF-α treated wells. We have presented a model of the blood-CSF barrier that will allow study into pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions in the brain, while simultaneously measuring real time changes to epithelial cells.</AbstractText>"}

The long processes of neurons represent a significant <i>spatial</i> challenge and make these cells particularly dependent on mechanisms for long-range cytoskeletal transport of proteins, RNA and organelles. Although many studies have substantiated a role for defective transport of axonal cargoes in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, remarkably little is known about how transport is regulated throughout ageing. The scale of the challenge posed by ageing is considerable because, in this case, the <i>temporal</i> regulation of transport is ultimately dictated by the length of organismal lifespan, which can extend to days, years or decades. Recent methodological advances to study live axonal transport during ageing <i>in situ</i> have provided new tools to scratch beneath the surface of this complex problem and revealed that age-dependent decline in the transport of mitochondria is a common feature across different neuronal populations of several model organisms. In certain instances, the molecular pathways that affect transport in ageing animals have begun to emerge. However, the functional implications of these observations are still not fully understood. Whether transport decline is a significant determinant of neuronal ageing or a mere consequence of decreased cellular fitness remains an open question. In this review, we discuss the latest developments in axonal trafficking in the ageing nervous system, along with the early studies that inaugurated this new area of research. We explore the possibility that the interplay between mitochondrial function and motility represents a crucial driver of ageing in neurons and put forward the hypothesis that declining axonal transport may be legitimately considered a hallmark of neuronal ageing.</AbstractText>"}

However, geochemical modelling and the occurrence of high <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He (that is, primordial) signatures in some volcanic rocks suggest that volumes of relatively undifferentiated mantle may reside in deeper, isolated regions<sup>2</sup>. Some basalts from large igneous provinces may provide temporally restricted glimpses of the most primitive parts of the mantle<sup>3,4</sup>, but key questions regarding the longevity of such sources on planetary timescales-and whether any survive today-remain unresolved. Kimberlites, small-volume volcanic rocks that are the source of most diamonds, offer rare insights into aspects of the composition of the Earth's deep mantle. The radiogenic isotope ratios of kimberlites of different ages enable us to map the evolution of this domain through time. Here we show that globally distributed kimberlites originate from a single homogeneous reservoir with an isotopic composition that is indicative of a uniform and pristine mantle source, which evolved in isolation over at least 2.5 billion years of Earth history-to our knowledge, the only such reservoir that has been identified to date. Around 200 million years ago, extensive volumes of the same source were perturbed, probably as a result of contamination by exogenic material. The distribution of affected kimberlites suggests that this event may be related to subduction along the margin of the Pangaea supercontinent. These results reveal a long-lived and globally extensive mantle reservoir that underwent subsequent disruption, possibly heralding a marked change to large-scale mantle-mixing regimes. These processes may explain why uncontaminated primordial mantle is so difficult to identify in recent mantle-derived melts.</AbstractText>"}

Here we present a single cell multi-omics study of mouse muscle stem cells, combining single-cell transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling. Aged cells show a global increase of uncoordinated transcriptional heterogeneity biased towards genes regulating cell-niche interactions. We find context-dependent alterations of DNA methylation in aged stem cells. Importantly, promoters with increased methylation heterogeneity are associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity of the genes they drive. These results indicate that epigenetic drift, by accumulation of stochastic DNA methylation changes in promoters, is associated with the degradation of coherent transcriptional networks during stem cell ageing.

The early erythroid progenitor, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), has substantial self-renewal potential and serves as a key cell type for the treatment of anemias. However, our understanding of mechanisms underlying BFU-E self-renewal is extremely limited. Here, we found that the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 4 (CHRM4), pathway regulates BFU-E self-renewal and that pharmacological inhibition of CHRM4 corrects anemias of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aging, and hemolysis. Genetic down-regulation of CHRM4 or pharmacologic inhibition of CHRM4 using the selective antagonist PD102807 promoted BFU-E self-renewal, whereas deletion of <i>Chrm4</i> increased erythroid cell production under stress conditions in vivo. Moreover, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists corrected anemias in mouse models of MDS, aging, and hemolysis in vivo, extending the survival of mice with MDS relative to that of controls. The effects of muscarinic receptor antagonism on promoting expansion of BFU-Es were mediated by cyclic AMP induction of the transcription factor CREB, whose targets up-regulated key regulators of BFU-E self-renewal. On the basis of these data, we propose a model of hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal through a cholinergic-mediated 'hematopoietic reflex' and identify muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists as potential therapies for anemias associated with MDS, aging, and hemolysis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In the fed state, the whole-body protein turnover model requires taking account of the contribution of absorbed tracee to the observed total appearance of tracee in the peripheral blood (exogenous appearance, Ra<sub>EXO</sub>). There are different approaches to estimating Ra<sub>EXO</sub> The use of an intrinsically labeled dietary protein is based on the overriding assumption that the appearance in the peripheral circulation of a tracer amino acid incorporated into a dietary protein is exactly proportional to the appearance of absorbed tracee. The bioavailability approach is based on the true ileal digestibility of the dietary protein and the irreversible loss of the tracee in the splanchnic bed via hydroxylation of the tracee (phenylalanine). Finally, Ra<sub>EXO</sub> can be estimated as the increase above the basal rate of appearance of the tracee using traditional tracer dilution methodology.

Different designs and materials have been developed over the years and have, in general, shown excellent results in pre-clinical testing. However, there have been incidences of serious complications when novel implants or materials are put into clinical use, with some well-known cases being metallosis in patients implanted with metal-on-metal hip replacements and osteolysis from polyethylene wear debris generated in hip and knee joint replacements. Unforeseen factors related to new designs, materials and surgical techniques can lead to different outcomes for pre-clinical testing and clinical use. While often an excellent indicator of a device's performance in clinical settings, pre-clinical testing does sometime fail to predict critical flaws in implant development. This article aims to explore the gaps in the current approach to testing. The ISO international standard of pre-clinical testing should be modified to more adequately capture actual clinical use of the implant and simulate daily activities.

This study aimed to examine relationships between posttraumatic growth, wisdom, and quality of life in older cancer survivors. Methods: A convenience sample of older cancer survivors after completing cancer treatments (n=121) participated from one public health center, and they filled out self-report questionnaires on measures of posttraumatic growth, wisdom, and quality of life. Results: As results of multiple regression analysis, the most significant factor on each domain of the quality of life has shown that higher levels of subjective economic status were associated with significant improvement of four domains of quality of life, and wisdom and posttraumatic growth were associated with significant improvement in social/family well-being. Conclusion: This study highlights predictors of each domain of quality of life that subjective economic status, posttraumatic growth and wisdom significantly affected the quality of life in older cancer survivors. Findings indicate that psychological interventions need to be developed and implemented for older cancer survivors to prevent long-term effects of cancer and to increase their quality of life.

When comparing the wet-then-dry and 56 days dry aged samples, only pH and retail yield differed. Australian and Japanese consumers rated dry aged steaks significantly higher (P &lt; .001) than the wet aged counterparts for tenderness, juiciness, flavour, overall liking and weighted palatability scores. The wet-then-dry steaks were also rated higher than the 56 days wet aged steaks for flavour, overall liking and palatability within the Japanese sensory panels. The Japanese consumers also consistently rated all MSA sensory attributes lower (P &lt; .001) than the Australian consumers. The results from this study show dry ageing provides a value adding opportunity for the meat industry in both domestic and export markets.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

During bottled aging, the chemical and organoleptic composition of wines is subject to changes depending on the aging conditions (closure, oxygen level, temperature, time). However, the combined effect of these factors on chemical composition and organoleptic characteristics of Malbec wines has not been studied yet. Wines were bottled with screw cap and natural cork and were kept in chambers at 15 °C and 25 °C for 2 years. Sampling was performed at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months. Concentrations of free sulfur dioxide, dissolved oxygen, anthocyanins, tannins, esters, volatile phenols, organic acids, and color saturation decreased during the storage process. While, the formation of polymeric pigments, the color attributes (lightness and hue) and the levels of alcohols, norisoprenoids, furanoids and terpenoids increased. At 24 months, Malbec wines were organoleptically different. Wines kept at 15 °C were associated with high sensory perceptions in color intensity and violet tint, those presented a positive correlation with free sulfur dioxide, tannins, and anthocyanins levels. On the contrary, wines aged at 25 °C were linked with high sensory perceptions of dried vegetative and dried fruit aromas. These descriptors were positively correlated with norisoprenoids, furanoids, and terpenoids. In general, the chemical composition and organoleptic attributes of bottled Malbec wines (Mendoza, Argentina) were stable respect closure type employed, but highly sensitive to the combined effect of time and storage temperature. This finding is key to making decisions about the wine style searched, and costs (e.g. refrigeration) involved in the conservation period until consumption.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Corvina grapes from eight contiguous vineyards were used for the study and vinified with the same protocol. The compounds analyzed by GC-MS were representative of the terpenoid, norisoprenoid and benzenoid chemical families. Free and bound compounds analysis showed that differences between parcels were relatively small on grapes samples, whereas after fermentation larger differences between wine samples were highlighted. Multivariate statistical analysis of wine volatiles highlighted the existence of similarities between wine volatile profiles, which reflected to a good extent the geographical location of the corresponding vineyard parcels. The main drivers of this diversity were the monoterpene alcohols linalool, α-terpineol, linalool oxide; the benzenoids vanillin, ethyl vanillate and methyl vanillate; and the norisoprenoid β-damascenone. Wine from one vineyard parcel was not correctly classified, possibly due to the influence of the peculiar training system applied to this parcel. With aging the vineyard parcel geographical diversity was still reflected by the chemical diversity of wines, even if the separation was less fine. As many reactions occurred, some drivers of the diversity were changed after aging. They were benzenoids: ethyl vanillate, methyl vanillate and vanillin; the norisoprenoid 3-oxo-α-ionol; the terpenes linalool oxide, linalool, p-methane-1,8-diol, α-terpineol, and the precursors of nerol, geraniol, linalool.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

In B cells, the cornerstone of humoral immunity, the development and distribution of the various mature B cell subsets are impacted by aging in both humans and mice. In addition, aged mature B cells demonstrate limited capacity to mount efficient antibody responses. An expected culprit for the decline in effective immunity is the rise of the systemic levels of pro-inflammatory molecules during aging, establishing a chronic low-grade inflammation. Indeed, numerous alterations affecting directly or indirectly B cells in old people and mice are reminiscent of various effects of acute inflammation on this cell type in young adults.

Knock-down of LncRNA-XIST promoted NSCLC cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation, which were reversed by synergistically treating cells with pyroptosis inhibitor Necrosulfonamide (NSA). In addition, knock-down of LncRNA-XIST also promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In parallel, ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) abrogated the effects of downregulated LncRNA-XIST on NSCLC cell pyroptosis.

Here, we show that the NLR family member NLRP3 and the purinergic receptor P2Y2 constitutively interact and regulate susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. We found that NLRP3 acts as an inhibitory factor of viral entry that represses F-actin remodeling. The binding of the HIV-1 envelope to its host cell receptors (CD4, CXCR4, and/or CCR5) overcomes this restriction by stimulating P2Y2. Once activated, P2Y2 enhances its interaction with NLRP3 and stimulates the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL to NLRP3, ultimately leading to NLRP3 degradation. NLRP3 degradation is permissive for PYK2 phosphorylation (PYK2Y402<sup>∗</sup>) and subsequent F-actin polymerization, which is required for the entry of HIV-1 into host cells. Taken together, our results uncover a mechanism by which HIV-1 overcomes NLRP3 restriction that appears essential for the accomplishment of the early steps of HIV-1 entry.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, there is a need for vaccine technologies that can induce a robust, protective T<sub>RM</sub> response in these tissues. Nanoparticle (NP) vaccines offer important advantages over conventional vaccines; however, there has been minimal investigation into the design of NP-based vaccines for eliciting T<sub>RM</sub> responses. Here, we describe a pH-responsive polymeric nanoparticle vaccine for generating antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs. With a single intranasal dose, the NP vaccine elicited airway- and lung-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells and protected against respiratory virus challenge in both sublethal (vaccinia) and lethal (influenza) infection models for up to 9 weeks after immunization. In elucidating the contribution of material properties to the resulting T<sub>RM</sub> response, we found that the pH-responsive activity of the carrier was important, as a structurally analogous non-pH-responsive control carrier elicited significantly fewer lung-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We also demonstrated that dual-delivery of protein antigen and nucleic acid adjuvant on the same NP substantially enhanced the magnitude, functionality, and longevity of the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> response in the lungs. Compared to administration of soluble antigen and adjuvant, the NP also mediated retention of vaccine cargo in pulmonary antigen-presenting cells (APCs), enhanced APC activation, and increased production of T<sub>RM</sub>-related cytokines. Overall, these data suggest a promising vaccine platform technology for rapid generation of protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs.</AbstractText>"}

In 699 observations from all 298 participants, mean estimated changes in the relative ratios of telomere repeat copy number to single-copy gene (T/S) were for no training, 0.004 (95% CI, -0.010 to 0.018); Presence, -0.007 (95% CI, -0.025 to 0.011); Affect, -0.005 (95% CI, -0.019 to 0.010); and Perspective, -0.001 (95% CI, -0.017 to 0.016). Cortical thickness change data were analyzed in 167 observations from 67 retest control participants (37 women [55.2%], mean [SD] age, 39.6 [9.0] years). In this retest control cohort subsample, naturally occurring LTL change was related to CT change in the left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex (mean t161 = 3.22; P &lt; .001; r = 0.246). At the individual participant level, leukocyte telomere shortening as well as lengthening were observed. Leukocyte telomere shortening was related to cortical thinning (t77 = 2.38; P = .01; r = 0.262), and leukocyte telomere lengthening was related to cortical thickening (t77 = 2.42; P = .009; r = 0.266). All analyses controlled for age, sex, and body mass index.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Conclusions and Relevance' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>The findings of this trial indicate an association between short-term change in LTL and concomitant change in plasticity of the left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex. This result contributes to the evidence that LTL changes more dynamically on the individual level than previously thought. Further studies are needed to determine potential long-term implications of such change in relation to cellular aging and the development of neurodegenerative disorders. No effect of contemplative mental training was noted in what may be, to date, the longest intervention with healthy adults.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Trial Registration' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01833104.</AbstractText>"}

Cellular senescence is a molecular process targeted by novel senolytic drugs. We quantified senescence in penetrating arteries and tested whether myocyte senescence was associated with cSVD. We immunolabeled subcortical white matter of older persons (age 80-96 years, n = 60) with minimal AD, using antibodies to 2 established senescence markers (H3K9me3, γH2AX) and a myocyte marker (hSMM). Within the walls of penetrating arteries (20-300 µm), we quantified senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF)-positive nuclei, cell density (nuclei/µm2), and sclerotic index (SI). Senescent-appearing mural cells were present in small arteries of all cases. cSVD cases exhibited a lower proportion of senescent-appearing cells and lower area fraction (AF%) of SAHF-positive nuclei compared to controls (p = 0.014, 0.016, respectively). cSVD severity and SI both correlated negatively with AF% (p = 0.013, 0.002, respectively). Mural cell density was lower (p &lt; 0.001) and SI higher (p &lt; 0.001) in cSVD, relative to controls. In conclusion, senescent myocyte-like cells were universal in penetrating arteries of an AD-free cohort aged 80 years and older. Senescent-appearing nuclei were more common in persons aged 80 years and older without cSVD compared to cSVD cases, indicating caution in senolytic drug prescribing. Myocyte senescence and cSVD may represent alternative vessel fates in the aging human brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Plastic senescence is not easily explained by mutation accumulation or antagonistic pleiotropy but is a corollary of the disposable soma theory. The life span differences among castes of the eusocial Hymenoptera are potentially some of the most striking and extreme examples of life span plasticity. Although these differences are often assumed to be plastic, this has never been demonstrated conclusively because differences in life span may be caused by the proximate effects of different levels of environmental hazard experienced by castes. Here age-dependent and age-independent components of instantaneous mortality rates of the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) were estimated from published life tables for natural and seminatural populations to determine whether differences in life span between queens and workers and between different types of workers are indeed plastic. These differences in life span were found to be due to differences in the rate of actuarial senescence, which correlate positively with the rate of extrinsic mortality, in accordance with the central prediction of evolutionary theories of senescence. Although all three evolutionary theories of senescence could in principle explain such plastic senescence, given differential gene expression between castes or life stages, only the disposable soma theory adequately explains the adaptive regulation of somatic maintenance in response to different environmental conditions that appears to underlie life span plasticity.</AbstractText>"}

Their preparation is typically defined by multiple interconnected variables (e.g., reagent sources, molar ratios, aging treatments, reaction time and temperature, among others), but unfortunately their distinctive influence, particularly on the nucleation and crystallization processes, is still far from being understood. Thus, the discovery and/or optimization of specific zeolites is closely related to the exploration of the parametric space through trial-and-error methods, generally by studying the influence of each parameter individually. In the past decade, machine learning (ML) methods have rapidly evolved to address complex problems involving highly nonlinear or massively combinatorial processes that conventional approaches cannot solve. Considering the vast and interconnected multiparametric space in zeolite synthesis, coupled with our poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in their nucleation and crystallization, the use of ML is especially timely for improving zeolite synthesis. Indeed, the complex space of zeolite synthesis requires drawing inferences from incomplete and imperfect information, for which ML methods are very well-suited to replace the intuition-based approaches traditionally used to guide experimentation. In this Account, we contend that both existing and new ML approaches can provide the 'missing link' needed to complete the traditional zeolite synthesis workflow used in our quest to rationalize zeolite synthesis. Within this context, we have made important efforts on developing ML tools in different critical areas, such as (1) data-mining tools to process the large amount of data generated using high-throughput platforms; (2) novel complex algorithms to predict the formation of energetically stable hypothetical zeolites and guide the synthesis of new zeolite structures; (3) new 'ab initio' organic structure directing agent predictions to direct the synthesis of hypothetical or known zeolites; (4) an automated tool for nonsupervised data extraction and classification from published research articles. ML has already revolutionized many areas in materials science by enhancing our ability to map intricate behavior to process variables, especially in the absence of well-understood mechanisms. Undoubtedly, ML is a burgeoning field with many future opportunities for further breakthroughs to advance the design of molecular sieves. For this reason, this Account includes an outlook of future research directions based on current challenges and opportunities. We envision this Account will become a hallmark reference for both well-established and new researchers in the field of zeolite synthesis.</AbstractText>"}

Beef sirloins were dry-aged for 28 days using different wind speeds (0, 2.5, and 5 m/s) at 1 to 3 °C and 75% relative humidity, and microbial compositions were confirmed by microbiome analysis. Mold and yeast samples were plated on potato dextrose agar supplemented with 10% tartaric acid, and the isolated colonies were identified by DNA sequencing. The isolates were subjected to microbial characterization (morphological characterization, growth condition, and enzyme activity). Microbiome analysis showed that the dominant microorganisms were molds and yeasts identified as Pilaira anomala SMFM201611 and Debaryomyces hansenii SMFM201707. Pilaira anomala SMFM201611 and D. hansenii SMFM201707 were inoculated into 24 sirloins of the lowest grade. All samples were dry-aged for 0, 14, 21, and 28 days and analyzed for microbial growth, pH, shear force, ultrastructure, and flavor compounds (free amino acids and free fatty acids). Inoculation with P. anomala SMFM201611 and D. hansenii SMFM201707 improved tenderness and cause the breakdown of myofibrils by proteolysis. Both microorganisms also produced free amino acids and fatty acids through proteolytic and lipolytic activities. These results indicate that P. anomala SMFM201611 and D. hansenii SMFM201707 isolated and identified from dry-aged beef can improve the quality of low-grade beef during dry-aging.

Studies have shown that lycopene can significantly inhibit oxidative stress; therefore, we hypothesized that lycopene can reduce the level of oxidative stress in vascular dementia. A vascular dementia model was established by permanent bilateral ligation of common carotid arteries. The dosage groups were treated with lycopene (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) every other day for 2 months. Rats without bilateral carotid artery ligation were prepared as a sham group. To test the ability of learning and memory, the Morris water maze was used to detect the average escape latency and the change of search strategy. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe changes of hippocampal neurons. The levels of oxidative stress factors, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, were measured in the hippocampus by biochemical detection. The levels of reactive oxygen species in the hippocampus were observed by dihydroethidium staining. The distribution and expression of oxidative stress related protein, neuron-restrictive silencer factor, in hippocampal neurons were detected by immunofluorescence histochemistry and western blot assays. After 2 months of drug administration, (1) in the model group, the average escape latency was longer than that of the sham group, and the proportion of straight and tend tactics was lower than that of the sham group, and the hippocampal neurons were irregularly arranged and the cytoplasm was hyperchromatic. (2) The levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde in the hippocampus of the model group rats were increased, and the activity of superoxide dismutase was decreased.

When endogeneity is ignored, regression coefficient estimators can be severely biased. To deal with endogeneity, instrument variable methods have been widely used. However, the instrument variable method often requires external instrument variables with certain conditions that cannot be verified empirically. Methods that use the within-cluster variations of the endogenous variable work under the restriction that either the outcome or the endogenous variable has a linear relationship with the cluster-level random effect. We propose a new method for binary outcome when it follows a logistic mixed-effects model and the endogenous variable is normally distributed but not linear in the random effect. The proposed estimator capitalizes on the nested data structure without requiring external instrument variables. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Furthermore, our method can be applied when the endogenous variable is missing in a cluster-specific nonignorable mechanism, without requiring that the missing mechanism be correctly specified. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed approach via simulation and apply the method to a health care study using a San Diego inpatient dataset. Our study demonstrates that the clustered structure can be exploited to draw valid analysis of multilevel data with correlated effects.</AbstractText>"}

The increased morbidity, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality associated with CAN is established from numerous epidemiological studies. However, CAN is increasingly recognised in people with prediabetes (pre-DM) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) with a reported prevalence up to 11% and 24% respectively. CAN is associated with components of MetS including hypertension and obesity, predating hyperglycaemia. The aetiology of CAN is multifactorial and there is a reciprocal relationship with insulin resistance and MetS. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is also associated with CAN possibly through MetS and an independent mechanism. An estimated global prevalence of the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) form of pre-DM of 587 million people by 2045 means CAN will become a major clinical problem. CAN is independently associated with silent myocardial ischaemia, major cardiovascular events, myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular mortality. Screening for CAN in pre-DM using risk scores with analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) or Sudoscan is important to allow earlier treatment at a reversible stage. The link between obesity and CAN highlights the therapeutic potential of lifestyle interventions including diet and physical activity to reverse MetS and prevent CAN. Weight loss achieved using these dietary and exercise lifestyle interventions improves the sympathetic and parasympathetic HRV indices of cardiac autonomic function. Further research is needed to identify high-risk populations of people with pre-DM or obesity that might benefit from targeted pharmacotherapy including metformin, sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues. Bariatric surgery also improves HRV through weight loss which might also prevent CAN in severe obesity. This article reviews the literature on CAN in obesity, pre-DM and MetS, to help determine a rationale for screening, early intervention treatment and formulate future research questions in this highly prevalent condition.</AbstractText>"}

Vascular senescence is an important contributor to end-organ dysfunction. Exosomes are released ubiquitously into the circulation, and transfer their cargo to target cells facilitating physiological and pathological processes. Plasma exosomes from 15 patients with polysomnographically diagnosed OSA at baseline (OSA-T1) after 12 months of adherent CPAP treatment (OSA-T2), 13 untreated OSA patients at 12-months intervals (OSA-NT1, OSA-NT2), and 12 controls (CO1 and CO2) were applied on naïve human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-D) cells. Expression of several senescence gene markers including p16 (CDKN2A), SIRT1 and SIRT6 and immunostaining for β-galactosidase activity (x-gal) were performed. Endothelial cells were also exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH) or normoxia (RA) or treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), stained with x-gal and subjected to qRT-PCR. Exosomes from OSA-T1, OSA-NT1, and OSA-NT2 induced significant increases in x-gal staining compared to OSA-T2, CO1 and CO2 (p-value &lt;0.01). p16 expression was significantly increased (p&lt;0.01), while SIRT1 and SIRT6 expression levels were decreased (p&lt;0.02 and p&lt;0.009). Endothelial cells exposed to IH or to H2O2 showed significant increases in x-gal staining (p&lt;0.001) and in senescence gene expression. Circulating exosomes in untreated OSA induce marked and significant increases in senescence of naïve endothelial cells, which are only partially reversible upon long-term adherent CPAP treatment. Furthermore, endothelial cells exposed to IH or H2O2 also elicit similar responses. Thus, OSA either directly or indirectly via exosomes may initiate and exacerbate cellular aging, possibly via oxidative stress-related pathways.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Sleep Research Society 2019.

While inflammation clearly contributes to vision loss in AMD, the mechanism remains controversial. Here we show that neutrophils are important in this inflammatory process. In the retinas of both early AMD patients and in a mouse model with an early AMD-like phenotype, we show neutrophil infiltration. Such infiltration was confirmed experimentally using ribbon-scanning confocal microscopy (RSCM) and IFNλ- activated dye labeled normal neutrophils. With neutrophils lacking lipocalin-2 (LCN-2), infiltration was greatly reduced. Further, increased levels of IFNλ in early AMD trigger neutrophil activation and LCN-2 upregulation. LCN-2 promotes inflammation by modulating integrin β1 levels to stimulate adhesion and transmigration of activated neutrophils into the retina. We show that in the mouse model, inhibiting AKT2 neutralizes IFNλ inflammatory signals, reduces LCN-2-mediated neutrophil infiltration, and reverses early AMD-like phenotype changes. Thus, AKT2 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in early, dry AMD.</AbstractText>"}

MPS is the primary regulated variable influencing muscle net balance with dietary amino acid ingestion representing the single most important nutritional variable enhancing post-exercise rates of muscle protein synthesis. Dose-response studies in average (i.e., ~80 kg) males have reported an absolute 20 g dose of high quality, rapidly digested protein maximizes mixed, and myofibrillar protein synthetic rates. However, it is unclear if these absolute protein intakes can be viewed in a 'one size fits all' solution. Re-analysis of published literature in young adults suggests a relative single meal intake of ~0.31 g/kg of rapidly digested, high quality protein (i.e., whey) should be considered as a nutritional guideline for individuals of average body composition aiming to maximize post-exercise myofibrillar protein synthesis while minimizing irreversible amino acid oxidative catabolism that occurs with excessive intakes of this macronutrient. This muscle-specific bolus intake is lower than that reported to maximize whole body anabolism (i.e., ≥0.5 g/kg). Review of the available literature suggests that potential confounders such as the co-ingestion of carbohydrate, sex, and amount of active muscle mass do not represent significant barriers to the translation of this objectively determined relative protein intake. Additional research is warranted to elucidate the effective dose for proteins with suboptimal amino acid compositions (e.g., plant-based), and/or slower digestion rates as well as whether recommendations are appreciably affected by other physiological conditions such endurance exercise, high habitual daily protein ingestion, aging, obesity, and/or periods of chronic negative energy balance.</AbstractText>"}

This degenerative loss of muscle mass is associated with poor quality of life and early mortality humans. The loss of muscle mass occurs due to acute changes in daily muscle net protein balance (NPB). It is generally believed a poor NPB occurs due to reduced muscle protein synthetic responses to exercise, dietary amino acid availability, or an insensitivity of insulin to suppress breakdown. Hence, aging muscles appear to be resistant to the anabolic action of exercise and protein (amino acids or hormonal) when compared to their younger counterparts. The mechanisms that underpin anabolic resistance to anabolic stimuli (protein and resistance exercise) are multifactorial and may be partly driven by poor lifestyle choices (increased sedentary time and reduced dietary protein intake) as well as an inherent dysregulated mechanism in old muscles irrespective of the environmental stimuli. The insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), Akt /Protein Kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is the primary driver between mechanical contraction and protein synthesis and may be a site of dysregulation between old and younger people. Therefore, our review aims to describe and summarize the differences seen in older muscle in this pathway in response to resistance exercise (RE) and describe approaches that researchers have sought out to maximize the response in muscle. Furthermore, this review will present the hypothesis that inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) may be implicated in IGF-1 signaling and thus sarcopenia, based on recent evidence that IGF-1 and insulin share some intracellular bound signaling events and that IP6K1 has been implicated in skeletal muscle insulin resistance.</AbstractText>"}

Recent research has provided evidence that operations may promote cancer metastases under some circumstances. <b>Methods:</b> A mouse model of breast cancer (administration of the murine breast cancer 4T1 cells subcutaneously) and the stress of operation were used to compare immune responses and survival outcomes. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the expression of CD11b and Gr1 MDSCs in tumor tissues and lung metastases. Cytokine levels were detected with three-color flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MDSCs were isolated and co-cultured with 4T1 cells to identify any morphological change with immunofluorescence. The anti Gr-1 antibody was used to detect the function of the anti-Gr1 treatment in breast cancer. <b>Results:</b> The operative stress impaired the overall survival, leading to an increased number of MDSCs that preferentially infiltrated the tumor microenvironment and promoted tumor metastasis. In both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays, MDSCs induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells through the up-regulation of TGF-beta1, VEGF, and IL-10. Furthermore, a treatment strategy of MDSC depletion was found to reduce pulmonary metastases after operations. <b>Conclusions:</b> The stress of operation could impair the overall survival in mice. The infiltrated MDSCs appear to induce EMT of tumor cells and increase metastases through the up-regulation of TGF-beta1, VEGF, and IL-10 levels. MDSC depletion could be a promising treatment strategy to prevent immune evasion after operations.</AbstractText>"}

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that a national cancer-control programme should aim to reduce cancer incidence and mortality and improve quality of life of cancer patients, through a national cancer-control plan (NCCP) that is systematic, equitable and evidence-based. Despite this, only 11 countries in Africa have a current NCCP. Participants in a US National Cancer Institute-supported, multi-year, technical assistance programme for cancer-control planning noted three main opportunities to improve how plans are created and implemented: 1) mobilisation of resources and partners for plan implementation; 2) accurate surveillance data to promote better resourcing of NCCPs; and, 3) sustainable and innovative partnership models to strengthen capacity to implement NCCPs. Most countries in the region face similar challenges in the development and implementation of an NCCP, including inadequate human, technical, and financial resources. Collaborative partnerships increase access to evidence-based cancer-control planning tools, mentoring and technical assistance, and have the potential to bridge the capacity gap and catalyse better implementation of NCCPs. Challenges can be overcome by better leveraging these opportunities to address the gaps that inhibit cancer control in Africa.</AbstractText>"}

On the other hand, tumor formation is also associated with drastic epigenetic aberrations, which can impact the genetic sequence. Therefore, the question arises if malignant transformation is primarily caused by genetic or epigenetic events. The tight connection of these processes becomes obvious by the fact that in several malignancies, as well as in age-related clonal hematopoiesis, mutations are particularly observed in epigenetic writers such as <i>DNMT3A</i> and <i>TET2</i>. On the other hand, specific epigenetic aberrations, so-called 'epimutations,' can mimic genomic mutations. In contrast to the genetic sequence, which remains relatively stable throughout life, the epigenome notoriously undergoes drastic changes in normal hematopoietic development and aging. It is conceivable that such epigenetic reorganization, e.g., in 3D chromatin conformation, paves the way for secondary chromosomal instabilities, which then result in tumor-specific genomic changes that further trigger disease progression. This scenario might explain the occurrence of tumor-specific mutations particularly in the elderly. Taken together, the causality dilemma is difficult to solve because genetic and epigenetic aberrations are interlinked during disease development. A better understanding of how the chromatin structure or 3D nuclear organization can evoke specific mutations might provide new perspectives for prevention, early diagnostics, and targeted therapy.</AbstractText>"}

In the edible mushroom <i>Lentinula edodes</i>, the hyphae are classified as either monokaryotic or dikaryotic, with each monokaryotic hyphal cell containing one haploid nucleus, and each dikaryotic hyphal cell containing two haploid nuclei. The dikaryotic hyphae are the results of mating between two genetically distinct monokaryons with different mating types. In this study, we examined the nuclear number and size (a potential correlate to ploidy) of <i>L. edodes</i> mycelia throughout its vegetative growth. We found that the number of nuclei within individual hyphal cells varied widely from non-nucleated to uninucleated, dinucleated, and multinucleated. Additionally, different nuclei within the same cell appeared very different in size, with a maximum nucleus cross-sectional area of 4.94 μm<sup>2</sup> and the minimum nucleus cross-sectional area at only 0.37 μm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, as culture time increased, more cells appeared to be devoid of any nuclei, with transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays of late-stage cultures showing autophagosomes fusing and dissolving the nuclei and resulting in a large number of TUNEL-positive DNA fragments in non-nucleated cells.

These osteoporotic conditions are associated with oxidative stress and hyperglycemia which are both considered as critical factors underlying bone fragility. Glucose excess and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to favor adipogenesis over osteoblastogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether high glucose exposure could determine dysfunction of mature BMAds, specifically through ROS production. The effects of low (LG, 5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) concentrations were examined using human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) in the time course of differentiation, and, up to 21 days once adipocytes were mature. HG did not alter the adipocyte differentiation process of hBMSCs. Yet, after 21 days under HG exposure, <i>PPARG, CEBPA</i>, and adiponectin mRNA expressions were decreased. These alterations were also observed following adipogenic inducer withdrawal as well as in adipocytes fully differentiated in LG then cultured in HG for the last 11 days. Without inducers, HG condition also led to decreased leptin mRNA level. Importantly, intracellular and extracellular ROS concentrations measured using Amplex Red were significantly raised by 50% under HG exposure. This rise was observed once adipocytes ended differentiation and was reproduced within the different cell culture settings without any cytotoxicity. Among genes involved in ROS metabolism, the mRNA level of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generating enzyme NOX4 was found upregulated in the presence of HG. Following cell separation, mature BMAds were shown to overproduce ROS and to display the gene alterations in contrast to non-lipid-laden cells. Finally, a non-lethal treatment with a pro-oxidant agent under LG condition reduces the mRNA levels of <i>PPARG</i>, adiponectin, and leptin as the HG condition does in the absence of inducers, and amplifies the effect of glucose excess on gene expression. HG concentration drives mature BMAds toward altered expression of the main adipokines and transcriptional factors. These perturbations are associated with a rise in ROS generation likely mediated through enhanced expression of <i>NOX4</i>. Mature BMAds are thus responsive to changes in glucose and ROS concentrations, which is relevant regarding with their phenotype and function in age- or metabolic disease-related osteoporosis.</AbstractText>"}

The primary aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between older workers' employability (self-)perceptions and their intention to continue working until their official retirement age. In addition, we studied the role of potential antecedents of their perceived employability at three different levels: training and education in current expertise area as well as in an adjacent expertise area (individual level factor), learning value of the job (job level factor), and organizational career management practices (organizational level factor). Data were collected by means of e-questionnaires that were distributed among two groups of Dutch older (45-plus) white collar workers. The samples consisted of 223 employees of an insurance company, and 325 university workers, respectively. Our research model was tested separately in each sample using Structural Equation Modeling. We controlled for effects of respondents' (self-)perceived health and (self-)perceived financial situation. Similar results were found for both samples. First, the relationship of perceived employability with the intention to continue working until one's retirement age was positive, whereas the relationship between a perceived good financial situation with the intention to continue working until one's retirement age was negative. Secondly, as regards the potential antecedents, results showed that the learning value of the job was positively related to perceived employability. In addition, an employee's perception of good health is a relevant correlate of perceived employability. So, whereas perceived employability contributes to the intention to continue working until one's retirement age, a good financial situation is a push factor to retire early. In order to promote the labor participation of older workers, this study indicates that organizations should focus on the learning possibilities that are inherent to one's job rather than on providing additional training or career management.

Here we first assessed and compared the performance of cognition and synaptic plasticity in young (3-5-month old) and aged c57BL/6J mice (19-21 months old). Findings from behavioral tests demonstrated that old mice, compared to young mice, displayed impairments in spatial learning/memory, working memory, and behavioral flexibility. Further, synaptic electrophysiology experiments on hippocampal slices revealed that the early form of long-term potentiation (LTP, a synaptic model for memory formation) was inhibited in old mice. At the molecular level, biochemical assays on the hippocampus showed dysregulation of signaling pathways controlling protein synthesis capacity including: up-regulation of AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K signaling, which is associated with translation of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) class of mRNAs that encode translational machinery; hyper-phosphorylation of mRNA translational elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and its upstream regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating repression of general protein synthesis. Moreover, young and old mice exhibited similar brain levels of translational initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, which is known to be increased in AD and linked to the disease pathophysiology. Thus, our data provide evidence at the molecular level to highlight the similarity and difference between normal and pathological aging, which may contribute to future studies on diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for aging-related dementia syndromes.</AbstractText>"}

Appoptosin is a pro-apoptotic protein that contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. However, whether appoptosin mediates oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity has yet to be determined. Here, we observe that appoptosin protein levels are induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) exposure through the inhibition of proteasomal appoptosin degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of appoptosin induces apoptosis through the JNK-FoxO1 pathway. Importantly, knockdown of appoptosin can ameliorate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in primary neurons.

The multi-factorial nature of AD neuropathology and symptomatology has taught us that a single therapeutic approach will most likely not fit all. Women constitute ~70% of the affected AD population, and pathology and rate of symptoms progression are 2-3 times higher in women than men. Epidemiological data suggest that menopausal estrogen loss may be causative of the more severe symptoms observed in AD women, however, results from clinical trials employing estrogen replacement therapy are inconsistent. AD pathological hallmarks-amyloid β (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and chronic gliosis-are laid down during a 20-year prodromal period before clinical symptoms appear, which coincides with the menopause transition (peri-menopause) in women (~45-54-years-old). Peri-menopause is marked by widely fluctuating estrogen levels resulting in periods of irregular hormone-receptor interactions. Recent studies showed that peri-menopausal women have increased indicators of AD phenotype (brain Aβ deposition and hypometabolism), and peri-menopausal women who used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) had a reduced AD risk. This suggests that neuroendocrine changes during peri-menopause may be a trigger that increases risk of AD in women. Studies on sex differences have been performed in several AD rodent models over the years. However, it has been challenging to study the menopause influence on AD due to lack of optimal models that mimic the human process. Recently, the rodent model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) was developed, which uniquely recapitulates human menopause, including a transitional peri-AOF period with irregular estrogen fluctuations and a post-AOF stage with low estrogen levels. This model has proven useful in hypertension and cognition studies with wild type animals. This review article will highlight the molecular mechanisms by which peri-menopause may influence the female brain vulnerability to AD and AD risk factors, such as hypertension and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Studies on these biological mechanisms together with the use of the AOF model have the potential to shed light on key molecular pathways underlying AD pathogenesis for the development of precision medicine approaches that take sex and hormonal status into account.</AbstractText>"}

Since it was first described, there has been a constant increase in its incidence and, for now, there are no effective treatments since current approved medications have only shown short-term symptomatic benefits. Therefore, it is imperative to increase efforts in the search for molecules and non-pharmacological strategies that are capable of slowing or stopping the progress of the disease and, ideally, to reverse it. The amyloid cascade hypothesis based on the fundamental role of amyloid has been the central hypothesis in the last 30 years. However, since amyloid-directed treatments have shown no relevant beneficial results other theories have been postulated to explain the origin of the pathology. The brain is a highly metabolically active energy-consuming tissue in the human body. It has an almost complete dependence on the metabolism of glucose and uses most of its energy for synaptic transmission. Thus, alterations on the utilization or availability of glucose may be cause for the appearance of neurodegenerative pathologies like AD. In this review article, the hypothesis known as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D) will be evaluated by summarizing some of the data that has been reported in recent years. According to published research, the adherence over time to low saturated fatty acids diets in the context of the Mediterranean diet would reduce the inflammatory levels in brain, with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory glial activation and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In this situation, the insulin receptor pathway would be able to fine tune the mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells, regulation the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate intracellular balance, and becoming a key factor involved in the preservation of the synaptic connexions and neuronal plasticity. In addition, new targets and strategies for the treatment of AD will be considered in this review for their potential as new pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches.</AbstractText>"}

We have used this type of approach to evaluate the expression of several neurodegeneration-related genes on the development of tumors, particularly brain tumors of glial origin (gliomas), which are an aggressive and incurable type of cancer. We have observed that genes involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, correlate with better prognosis of gliomas. Within these genes, high <i>Tau/MAPT</i> expression shows the strongest correlation with several indicators of prolonged survival on glioma patients. Tau protein regulates microtubule stability and dynamics in neurons, although there have been reports of its expression in glial cells and also in gliomas. However, little is known about the regulation of <i>Tau/MAPT</i> transcription in tumors. Moreover, our <i>in silico</i> analysis indicates that this gene is also expressed in a variety of tumors, showing a general correlation with survival, although its function in cancer has not yet been addressed. Another remarkable aspect of Tau is its involvement in resistance to taxanes in various tumors types such as breast, ovarian and gastric carcinomas. This is due to the fact that taxanes have the same tubulin-binding site as Tau. In the present work we review the main knowledge about Tau function and expression in tumors, with a special focus on brain cancer.

Seventy late middle-aged adults were classified into open-skill, closed-skill, or irregular exercise groups based on their participation in exercise activities prior to the study and then performed a spatial working memory (SWM) task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning.

Meanwhile, early detection of MCI can prevent progression to AD. A great deal of research has been performed in the past decade on MCI detection. However, availability of biomarkers for MCI detection requires greater attention. In our study, we evaluated putative and reliable biomarkers for diagnosing MCI by performing different mental tasks (i.e., <i>N-</i>back task, Stroop task, and verbal fluency task) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals on a group of 15 MCI patients and 9 healthy control (HC). The 15 digital biomarkers (i.e., five means, seven slopes, peak, skewness, and kurtosis) and two image biomarkers (<i>t</i>-map, correlation map) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (i.e., left PFC, middle PFC, and right PFC) between the MCI and HC groups were investigated by the statistical analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and convolutional neural network (CNN) individually. The results reveal that the statistical analysis using digital biomarkers (with a <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.05) could not distinguish the MCI patients from the HC over 60% accuracy. Therefore, the current statistical analysis needs to be improved to be used for diagnosing the MCI patients. The best accuracy with LDA was 76.67% with the <i>N</i>-back and Stroop tasks. However, the CNN classification results trained by image biomarkers showed a high accuracy. In particular, the CNN results trained via <i>t</i>-maps revealed the best accuracy (90.62%) with the <i>N-</i>back task, whereas the CNN result trained by the correlation maps was 85.58% with the <i>N</i>-back task. Also, the results illustrated that investigating the sub-regions (i.e., right, middle, left) of the PFC for detecting MCI would be better than examining the whole PFC. The <i>t</i>-map (or/and the correlation map) is conclusively recommended as an image biomarker for early detection of AD. The combination of CNN and image biomarkers can provide a reliable clinical tool for diagnosing MCI patients.</AbstractText>"}

Changes related to cognitive decline may delay the stages of the speech production process in the aging brain. For example, semantic memory decline and poor inhibition may delay the retrieval of a concept from the mental lexicon. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable method for identifying the timing of speech production stages. So far, studies using EEG mainly focused on a particular speech production stage in a particular group of subjects. Differences between subject groups and between methodologies have complicated identifying time windows of the speech production stages. For the current study, the speech production stages lemma retrieval, lexeme retrieval, phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding were tracked using a 64-channel EEG in 20 younger adults and 20 older adults. Picture-naming tasks were used to identify lemma retrieval, using semantic interference through previously named pictures from the same semantic category, and lexeme retrieval, using words with varying age of acquisition. Non-word reading was used to target phonological encoding (using non-words with a variable number of phonemes) and phonetic encoding (using non-words that differed in spoken syllable frequency). Stimulus-locked and response-locked cluster-based permutation analyses were used to identify the timing of these stages in the full time course of speech production from stimulus presentation until 100 ms before response onset in both subject groups. It was found that the timing of each speech production stage could be identified. Even though older adults showed longer response times for every task, only the timing of the lexeme retrieval stage was later for the older adults compared to the younger adults, while no such delay was found for the timing of the other stages. The results of a second cluster-based permutation analysis indicated that clusters that were observed in the timing of the stages for one group were absent in the other subject group, which was mainly the case in stimulus-locked time windows. A <i>z</i>-score mapping analysis was used to compare the scalp distributions related to the stages between the older and younger adults. No differences between both groups were observed with respect to scalp distributions, suggesting that the same groups of neurons are involved in the four stages, regardless of the adults' age, even though the timing of the individual stages is different in both groups.</AbstractText>"}

There is however a limited number of studies that investigate this research question in animal models of aging. The current study investigated how temporal decision-making is affected by aging. Initially, we trained young (2-3 month-old) and old C57BL/6J male mice (18-19 month-old) independently with short (3 s) and long (9 s) intervals by signaling, in each trial, the hopper associated with the interval that is in effect in that trial. The probability of short and long trials was manipulated (0.25 or 0.75) for different animals in each age group. During testing, both hoppers were illuminated, and thus active trial type was not differentiated. We expected mice to spontaneously combine the independently acquired time interval-location-probability information to adaptively guide their timing behavior in test trials. This adaptive ability and the resultant timing behavior were analyzed and compared between the age groups. Both young and old mice indeed adjusted their timing behavior in an abrupt fashion based on the independently acquired temporal-spatial-probabilistic information. The core timing ability of old mice was also intact. However, old mice had difficulty in terminating an ongoing timed response when the probability for the short trial was higher and this difference disappeared in the group that was exposed to a lower probability of short trials. These results suggest an inhibition problem in old mice as reflected through the threshold modulation process in timed decisions, which is cognitively penetrable to the probabilistic information.</AbstractText>"}

As shown in our previous studies on guitar duets, and also on a guitar quartet, intra- and inter-brain synchronization plays an essential role during such interaction. At the same time, sensorimotor coordination as an essential part of this interaction requires being in sync with the auditory signals coming from the played instruments. In this study, using acoustic recordings of guitar playing and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity from guitarists playing in duet, we aimed to explore whether the musicians' brain activity synchronized with instrument sounds produced during guitar playing. To do so, we established an analytical method based on phase synchronization between time-frequency transformed guitar signals and raw EEG signals. Given phase synchronization, or coupling between guitar and brain signals, we constructed so-called <i>extended</i> hyper-brain networks comprising all possible interactions between two guitars and two brains. Applying a graph-theoretical approach to these networks assessed across time, we present dynamic changes of coupling strengths or dynamic orchestration of brains and instruments during free guitar improvisation for the first time. We also show that these dynamic network topology changes are oscillatory in nature and are characterized by specific spectral peaks, indicating the temporal structure in the synchronization patterns between guitars and brains. Moreover, extended hyper-brain networks exhibit specific modular organization varying in time, and binding each time, different parts of the network into the modules, which were mostly heterogeneous (i.e., comprising signals from different instruments and brains or parts of them). This suggests that the method capturing synchronization between instruments and brains when playing music provides crucial information about the underlying mechanisms. We conclude that this method may be an indispensable tool in the investigation of social interaction, music therapy, and rehabilitation dynamics.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we observe decreased expression of SNX8 in human AD and AD mouse brain. SNX8 predominantly localized to early and late endosomes, where SNX8 overexpression enhanced total APP levels, cell surface APP distribution and consequent soluble APPα cleavage. SNX8 depletion resulted in elevated β-amyloid (Aβ) levels, while SNX8 overexpression reduced Aβ levels in cells and in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Importantly, SNX8 overexpression rescued cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results implicate a neuroprotective role for SNX8 in enhancing non-amyloidogenic APP trafficking and processing pathways. Given that endosomal dysfunction is an early event in AD, restoration of dysfunctional endosomal components such as SNX8 may be beneficial in future therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>"}

To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it (1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, (2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and (3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined. Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level. We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing.

Cancer transformations profoundly alter cellular metabolism by increasing glucose consumption via glycolysis to support tumorigenesis. Here we confirm that relative to ER-positive cells (MCF7), TNBC cells (MBA-MD-231) rely more on glycolysis thus providing a rationale to target these cells with glycolytic inhibitors. Indeed, iodoacetate (IA), an effective GAPDH inhibitor, caused about 70% drop in MDA-MB-231 cell viability at 20 μM while 40 μM IA was needed to decrease MCF7 cell viability only by 30% within 4 hours of treatment. However, the triple negative cells showed strong ability to recover after 24 h whereas MCF7 cells were completely eliminated at concentrations &lt;10 μM. To understand the mechanism of MDA-MB-231 cell survival, we studied metabolic modulations associated with acute and extended treatment with IA. The resilient TNBC cell population showed a significantly greater count of cells with active mitochondria, lower apoptotic markers, normal cell cycle regulations, moderately lowered ROS, but increased mRNA levels of p27 and PARP1; all compatible with enhanced cell survival. Our results highlight an interplay between PARP and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in TNBC that comes into play in response to glycolytic disruption. In the light of these findings, we suggest that combined treatment with PARP and mitochondrial inhibitors may provide novel therapeutic strategy against TNBC.</AbstractText>"}

We have also proposed a consensus-based strategy to interpret the miRNAs expression data to gain a better insight into the molecular regulatory alterations during the incidence of PD. We evaluated the miRNA expression levels in the PBMCs obtained from 36 patients with PD and 16 healthy controls by the reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR and their performance to discriminate the PD patients from the healthy subjects assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Also, we applied our consensus and integration approach to construct a deregulated miRNA-based network in PD with the respective targets and transcription factors, and the enriched gene ontology and pathways using the enrichment analysis approach were obtained. There was a significant overexpression of miR-885 and miR-17 and the downregulation of miR-361 in the PD patients compared to the controls. The blood expression of miR-885 and miR-17 tended to increase along with the disease severity. On the other hand, the lower levels of miR-361 in the early stages of the PD patients, as compared to controls, and its higher levels in the advanced stages of PD patients, as compared to the early stages of the PD patients, were observed. Combination of all three miRNAs showed an appropriate value of AUC (0.985) to discriminate the PD patients from the healthy subjects.

Traditionally, most laboratory studies on bee ecotoxicology test acute exposure to single compounds. However, under field conditions, bees are often chronically exposed to a variety of chemicals, with potential synergistic effects. We studied the effects of field-realistic concentrations of three pesticides measured in pollen and nectar of commercial melon fields on the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. We orally exposed females of this species throughout their life span to 8 treatments combining two neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid) and a triazole fungicide (myclobutanil) via pollen and sugar syrup. We measured pollen and syrup consumption, longevity, ovary maturation and thermogenesis. Pesticide intake was three orders of magnitude higher via syrup than pollen. At the tested concentrations, no synergistic effects emerged, and we found no effects on longevity and ovary maturation. However, all treatments containing imidacloprid resulted in suppressed syrup consumption and drastic decreases in thoracic temperature and bee activity. Our results have important implications for pesticide regulation. If we had measured only lethal effects we would have wrongly concluded that the pesticide combinations containing imidacloprid were safe to O. bicornis. The incorporation of tests specifically intended to detect sublethal effects in bee risk assessment schemes should be an urgent priority. In this way, the effects of pesticide exposure on the dynamics of bee populations in agroecosystems will be better assessed.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated age differences in perceptual and conceptual processing of visual objects in a population-derived sample of 85 healthy adults (24-87 years old) by relating measures of object processing to cognition across the lifespan. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded during a picture naming task to provide a direct measure of neural activity, that is not confounded by age-related vascular changes. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate neural responsivity for each individual, namely the capacity to represent visual or semantic information relating to the pictures. We find that the capacity to represent semantic information is linked to higher naming accuracy, a measure of task-specific performance. In mature adults, the capacity to represent semantic information also correlated with higher levels of fluid intelligence, reflecting domain-general performance. In contrast, the latency of visual processing did not relate to measures of cognition. These results indicate that neural responsivity measures relate to naming accuracy and fluid intelligence. We propose that maintaining neural responsivity in older age confers benefits in task-related and domain-general cognitive processes, supporting the brain maintenance view of healthy cognitive ageing.</AbstractText>"}

Ageing causes primary sarcopenia, while secondary causes include chronic kidney disease (CKD), long-term use of glucocorticoids and obesity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia using guidelines recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP, 2010; EWGSOP2, 2018) and the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) and analyse the relationship between sarcopenia and body adiposity in adult renal transplant recipients (RTR). This was a cross-sectional study of adult RTR (BMI ≥ 18·5 kg/m2). Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthropometry. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) by CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration equation. The prevalence of sarcopenia in adult RTR (n 185; 57 % men, 50 (se 0·82) years and eGFR 55·80 (se 1·52) ml/min) was 7 % (FNIH), 11 % (EWGSOP2) and 17 % (EWGSOP). Low muscle mass, muscle function and physical performance affected, respectively, up to 28, 46 and 10 % of the participants. According to EWGSOP and EWGSOP2, body adiposity evaluated by anthropometry and DXA (percentage trunk fat) was lower in participants with sarcopenia. Conversely, according to the FNIH criteria, RTR with sarcopenia presented higher waist:height ratio. The present study suggests that adult RTR sarcopenia prevalence varies according to the diagnostic criteria; low muscle mass, low muscle function and low physical performance are common conditions; the association of body adiposity and sarcopenia depends on the criteria used to define this syndrome; and the FNIH criteria detected higher adiposity in individuals with sarcopenia.</AbstractText>"}

The current study examines occupational exposure to pesticides in relation to incident cardiovascular disease, defined as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular accident. Methods and Results With the Occupational Safety Health Administration exposure scale used as an estimate of exposure, statistical analyses were performed on a cohort of 7557 Japanese-American men from the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program. Hazard ratios for cardiovascular disease incidence were calculated for various levels of pesticide exposure using Cox proportional hazards models. In the first 10 years of follow-up, a positive association was observed between age-adjusted cardiovascular disease incidence and high levels of pesticide exposure (hazard ratio=1.46, 95% CI=1.10-1.95, <i>P</i>=0.009). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for other cardiovascular disease risk factors (hazard ratio=1.42, 95% CI=1.05-1.92, <i>P</i>=0.021). No significant association for coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular accident incidence with pesticide exposure was observed when examined separately, possibly due to a smaller number of events. Conclusions These findings suggest that occupational exposure to pesticides may play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The results are novel, as the association between occupational exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease incidence has not been examined previously in this unique cohort.</AbstractText>"}

Ideal SHPM should have not only simple operations, but also high elongations at break, tensile strain and self-healing properties at room temperature. Herein, the amidated carbon fibers (CFs) reinforced self-healing polymer composites were designed by hydrogen bonding interaction between functionalized CFs and hyperbranched polymers. The amidated CFs were prepared by transformation of hydroxyl to acylamino through a one-step amidation. By introducing amidated CFs, amidated CFs self-healing polymer composites (called AD-CF) exhibited many desirable characteristics compared to pure polymer composites, such as a better elasticity, lower healing temperatures, and higher self-healing efficiencies. The stress-strain test was selected to carefully study the self-healing property of the AD-CF. The observed same recovery condition, i.e. without any mechanical breakdown after the 10 sequential cycles of cutting and healing indicates no aging of the AD-CF. The ability of AD-CF to exhibit a soft state and rapid self-healing at room temperature makes it possible for much wider applications.</AbstractText>"}

The underlying mechanism by which RSV affects neutrophil activation has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RSV modulates the inflammatory activities of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated human neutrophils. We employed a well-established isolated-neutrophil model to investigate the effects of RSV on neutrophil functions and the underlying mechanism of signaling transduction. The lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI murine model was employed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of RSV. Experiment results demonstrate that RSV reduces respiratory burst, degranulation, integrin expression, and cell adhesion in activated neutrophils in dose-dependent manners. RSV inhibited phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and reduced their enzymatic activities. Moreover, RSV and a selective inhibitor of SFKs (PP2) reduced the phosphorylation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and Vav. There results indicated that the inhibitory effects of RSV are mediated through the inhibition of the SFKs-Btk-Vav pathway. This study also revealed that RSV attenuates endotoxin-induced lung injury. We surmise that the therapeutic effects of RSV on ALI may derive from its anti-neutrophilic inflammation function and free radical-scavenging effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies have investigated the behavior and output of linkage software. To determine how linkage quality is affected by different algorithms, blocking variables, methods for string matching and weight determination, and decision rules, we compared the performance of 4 nonproprietary linkage software packages linking patient identifiers from noninteroperable inpatient and outpatient EHRs. We linked datasets using first and last name, gender, and date of birth (DOB). We evaluated DOB and year of birth (YOB) as blocking variables and used exact and inexact matching methods. We compared the weights assigned to record pairs and evaluated how matching weights corresponded to a gold standard, medical record number. Deduplicated datasets contained 69,523 inpatient and 176,154 outpatient records, respectively. Linkage runs blocking on DOB produced weights ranging in number from 8 for exact matching to 64,273 for inexact matching. Linkage runs blocking on YOB produced 8 to 916,806 weights. Exact matching matched record pairs with identical test characteristics (sensitivity 90.48%, specificity 99.78%) for the highest ranked group, but algorithms differentially prioritized certain variables. Inexact matching behaved more variably, leading to dramatic differences in sensitivity (range 0.04-93.36%) and positive predictive value (PPV) (range 86.67-97.35%), even for the most highly ranked record pairs. Blocking on DOB led to higher PPV of highly ranked record pairs. An ensemble approach based on averaging scaled matching weights led to modestly improved accuracy. In summary, we found few differences in the rankings of record pairs with the highest matching weights across 4 linkage packages. Performance was more consistent for exact string matching than for inexact string matching. Most methods and software packages performed similarly when comparing matching accuracy with the gold standard. In some settings, an ensemble matching approach may outperform individual linkage algorithms.</AbstractText>"}

Tissue bioengineering is a promising approach for tendon therapy, with potential to improve its functional outcomes. However, evaluation criteria for tissue-engineered tendon are unclear due to the lack of specific markers of differentiated tendon. The study aim was to identify a panel of genes that characterised tendons in comparison to cartilage or muscles and validate those genes, both in human and key species used as models for tendon diseases. Gene expression profiling of rat tendon and cartilage in whole-tissue samples and primary tenocytes and chondrocytes was undertaken using two independent microarray platforms. Genes that demonstrated high expression correlation across two assays were validated by qRT-PCR in rat tendon relative to cartilage and muscle. Five genes demonstrating the highest tendon-related expression in the validation experiment (ASPN, ECM1, IGFBP6, TNMD, THBS4) were further evaluated by qRT-PCR in ovine, equine and human tissue. The group of tendon markers, identified by unbiased transcriptomic analysis of rat musculoskeletal tissues, demonstrated species-dependent profiles of expression. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) was identified as the only universal tendon marker. Further investigation in equine tendon showed that IGFBP6 expression was not affected by ageing or tendon function but decreased in anatomical regions subjected to elevated compressive force. IGFBP6 is a robust cross-species marker of tendon phenotype and may find application in evaluation of tendon physiology and guided differentiation of permissive cells towards functional tenocytes.</AbstractText>"}

Studies show that sleep plays important roles in brain functions, and loss of sleep is associated with increased risks for neurological diseases. Here, we used RNA sequencing to explore effects of age on transcriptome changes between sleep and sleep deprivation (SD) in medial prefrontal cortex and found that transcriptional changes with sleep are attenuated in old. In particular, old mice showed a 30% reduction in the number of genes significantly altered between sleep/wake and, in general, had smaller magnitudes of changes in differentially expressed genes compared to young mice. Gene ontology analysis revealed differential age effects on certain pathways. Compared to young mice, many of the wake-active functions were similarly induced by SD in old mice, whereas many of the sleep-active pathways were attenuated in old mice. We found similar magnitude of changes in synaptic homeostasis genes (Fos, Arc, and Bdnf) induced by SD, suggesting intact synaptic upscaling on the transcript level during extended wakefulness with aging. However, sleep-activated processes, such as DNA repair, synaptogenesis, and axon guidance, were sensitive to the effect of aging. Old mice expressed elevated levels of immune response genes when compared to young mice, and enrichment analysis using cell-type-specific markers indicated upregulation of microglia and oligodendrocyte genes in old mice. Moreover, gene sets of the two cell types showed age-specific sleep/wake regulation. Ultimately, this study enhances understanding of the transcriptional changes with sleep and aging, providing potential molecular targets for future studies of age-related sleep abnormalities and neurological disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, they have poor long-term stability at elevated temperatures due to coarsening of the metal nanoparticles. In this work we show that this can be mitigated by a novel design of the nano-structure of Ni cermet fuel electrodes for solid oxide cells. The strategy is to create a dual porosity microstructure, without the use of fugitive pore-formers, with micron-size pores to facilitate gas transport and nanoscale pores to control nano-particle coarsening. This has been achieved using a continuous hydrothermal synthesis and two-stage heat treatments to produce electrodes with micron size agglomerates of nano-structured porous Ni-Yttria-Stabilised-Zirconia (YSZ). This unique hierarchical microstructure combines enhanced electrochemical reaction in the high activity (triple phase boundary density 11 μm-2) nanoscale regions with faster gas diffusion in the micron-sized pores. The electrodes are aged at 800 °C in humidified 5% H2-N2 for up to 600 h. The electrochemical reaction resistance is initially 0.17 Ω cm2 but later reaches a steady long-term value of 0.15 Ω cm2. 3-D reconstruction of the electrodes after 10 h and 100 h of ageing reveals an increase in YSZ network connectivity and TPB percolation. This improvement is well-correlated to the 3-D tomography parameters using a physical model adapted from mixed conducting SOC air electrodes, which is also supported, for the first time, by numerical simulations of the microstructural evolution. These also reveal that in the long term, nickel coarsening is inhibited by the nanoscale entanglement of Ni and YSZ in the hierarchical microstructure.</AbstractText>"}

The clinical diagnosis of ovarian insufficiency relies on multiple variables including changes of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, antral follicle count, menstruation and age. It is proven that ovarian cells demonstrate dysfunction associated with aging including mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere shortening, impaired DNA repair, epigenetic changes and metabolic/energetic disorders.

However, mixed results have been found for associations between musical activity and visuo-spatial abilities, and less is known about associations with fluid intelligence. We explored differences between musicians (N = 30) and non-musicians (N = 30) aged 60-93 years old across a range of neuropsychological measures of cognitive function. Musicians performed significantly better than non-musicians on all domains, which remained after adjusting for age, gender, educational history, languages spoken and physical activity. As a cross-sectional comparison, the results should not be overstated; however, they are consistent with findings suggesting learning a musical instrument throughout the life course may be associated with cognitive benefits. Identifying potential lifestyle factors that have cognitive benefits in later life, such as musical experience, is an important step in developing intervention strategies for cognitive aging.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we sought to: (1) describe the frequency of harsh communication used by caregivers; (2) examine the relationship between harsh communication, caregiver and person with dementia characteristics; and (3) determine the contributions of caregiver depression and burden on such communication. <b>Method:</b> Cross-sectional baseline data were drawn from 250 dyads, who participated in the Dementia Behavior Study (NCT01892579). Hierarchical linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between dyad characteristics and harsh communication scores (using the 6-item Negative Communication Scale), controlling for three groups of covariates: sociodemographic, relationship characteristics and health factors. <b>Results:</b> More than half of the caregivers (mean age = 65.4, 81.2% women, 45.6% spouses) reported they felt like screaming/yelling (<i>N</i> = 138, 55.2%) or used a harsh tone (<i>N</i> = 129, 51.6%) at persons with dementia (Mini Mental Status Examination mean = 14.3, SD: 7.8) at least sometimes. When controlling for all covariates, for each unit increase in caregiver burden, harsh communication increased by 0.486 units (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); similarly, for each unit increase in caregiver depression, harsh communication increased by 0.301units (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Over half of dementia caregivers reported they felt like or used one or more harsh forms of communication. Caregiver burden and depression were incrementally associated with greater use of negative communication.

With suitable support, people living with dementia can continue employment - although, this is not appropriate for all. The requirement for employers to support employees living with dementia has human rights and legal foundations. This article considers whether employers consider dementia as a workplace concern; and the policies and/or practices available to support employees living with dementia. Thus, it develops understanding of whether employers are meeting their human rights/legislative obligations. <b>Method:</b> A sequential mixed-methods approach was employed, with data collection undertaken in Scotland (United Kingdom). An online survey was sent to employers across Scotland, with 331 participating. Thirty employer interviews were conducted, with the survey results informing the interview approach. <b>Results:</b> The survey and interview data were analyzed separately and then combined and presented thematically. The themes identified were (1) Dementia as a workplace concern, (2) Support for employees living with dementia and (3) Employer policy development and awareness raising. The findings demonstrate dementia awareness, but this knowledge is not applied to employment situations. There was little evidence suggesting that the rights of employees living with dementia are consistently upheld. <b>Conclusion:</b> This research sends out strong messages about the rights and legal position of person living with dementia which cannot be ignored. The continuing potential of employees living with dementia and their legal rights are not consistently recognized. This highlights the need for robust training interventions for employers.</AbstractText>"}

Although these diseases show different clinical manifestations, the presence of toxic protein aggregates in the brain of patients is a common feature to all of them, suggesting a loss of protein homeostasis. Aging, the primary risk factor for the majority of neurodegenerative disorders, is linked to the impairment of degradative compartments such as lysosomes and autophagosomes. Besides, many genetic factors for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or frontotemporal dementia, as examples of frequent neurodegenerative diseases, are causative of endo-lysosomal and autophagosomal dysfunctions. There is scientific evidence suggesting that neurons can counteract the accumulation of undegraded cellular material by the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are vesicles with a size ranging from 50 to 100 nm generated in a type of endosomal compartment named multivesicular body. EVs play a crucial role in removing cellular waste, promoting protein aggregation, and spreading toxic protein aggregates in the brain of patients. In this review, the interplay between the impairment of degradative compartments, the secretion of EVs, and their pathological/beneficial role in neurodegeneration is described.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate how implantation and the strain distribution in the implant affect the pattern of bone ingrowth and how changes in tissue density within the pores alter the stresses in implants. The hypothesis was that porous metal implants are susceptible to fatigue failure, and that this reduces as osteointegration occurs. A phenomenological, finite element analysis (FEA) bone remodelling model was used to predict partial bone formation for two porous (pore sizes of 700 μm and 1500 μm), laser sintered Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V implants in an ovine condylar defect model, and was compared and verified against in vivo, histology results. The FEA models predicted partial bone formation within the porous implants, but over-estimated the amount of bone-surface area compared to histology results. The stress and strain in the implant and adjacent tissues were assessed before, during bone remodelling, and at equilibrium. Results showed that partial bone formation improves the stress distribution locally by reducing stress concentrations for both pore sizes, by at least 20%. This improves the long-term fatigue resistance for the larger pore implant, as excessively high stress is reduced to safer levels (86% of fatigue strength) as bone forms. The stress distribution only changed slightly in regions without bone growth. As the extent of bone formation into extensively porous bone implants depends on the level of stress shielding, the design of the implant and stiffness have significant influence on bone integration and need to be considered carefully to ensure the safety of implants with substantial porous regions. To our knowledge this is the first time that the effect of bone formation on stress distribution within a porous implant has been described and characterised.</AbstractText>"}

In various countries, including those of the EU (under the Mutual Recognition Procedure), it is approved for the treatment of advanced levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease (PD) with severe motor fluctuations and hyperkinesia or dyskinesia when available combinations of Parkinson medicinal products have not given satisfactory results. In several other countries, including the USA, it is approved for the treatment of motor fluctuations in patients with advanced PD. In adults with advanced PD, levodopa/carbidopa ES improved motor fluctuations, activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) during short-term (12-week) treatment, with the beneficial effects on motor fluctuations largely sustained over the longer term (up to 7 years). Levodopa/carbidopa ES was generally well tolerated in this patient population, with adverse events (AEs) associated with aging, advanced PD-related comorbidities, the procedure/device or dopaminergic therapy. Its safety profile was comparable to that of oral levodopa/carbidopa with respect to non-procedure/device-associated AEs; most procedure/device-associated AEs were consistent in nature and incidence with medically recognised complications of the procedure in non-PD patients.

However, an alternative hypothesis is that navigation difficulties in aged people are associated with deficits in processing and encoding spatial cues. We tested this hypothesis by studying how geometry and landmark cues control navigation in young and older adults in a real, ecological environment. Recordings of body and gaze dynamics revealed a preference for geometry-based navigation in older adults, and for landmark-based navigation in younger ones. While cue processing was associated with specific fixation patterns, advanced age manifested itself in a longer reorientation time, reflecting an unbalanced exploration-exploitation trade-off in scanning policies. Moreover, a battery of tests revealed a specific cognitive deficit in older adults with geometric preference.

The mechanisms that regulate lysosomal cholesterol content to enable mTORC1 signalling are unknown. Here, we show that oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and its anchors at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), VAPA and VAPB, deliver cholesterol across ER-lysosome contacts to activate mTORC1. In cells lacking OSBP, but not other VAP-interacting cholesterol carriers, the recruitment of mTORC1 by the Rag GTPases is inhibited owing to impaired transport of cholesterol to lysosomes. By contrast, OSBP-mediated cholesterol trafficking drives constitutive mTORC1 activation in a disease model caused by the loss of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Chemical and genetic inactivation of OSBP suppresses aberrant mTORC1 signalling and restores autophagic function in cellular models of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). Thus, ER-lysosome contacts are signalling hubs that enable cholesterol sensing by mTORC1, and targeting the sterol-transfer activity of these signalling hubs could be beneficial in patients with NPC.</AbstractText>"}

However, the exact mechanism of PTSD inducing tau hyperphosphorylation remains unclear and therefore no effective treatment options are currently available. We here show that employing single prolonged stress (SPS), as a consensus PTSD model, induced a typical anxiety and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser202/Thr205 (AT8) and Ser404 but not at Ser199 and Ser396 in the hippocampus compared to the control rats. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the level of inactivated phosphorylated GSK-3β at Ser9, an increase in the level of activated phosphorylated GSK-3β at Thr216 and an obvious decrease in the level of activated phosphorylated ERK1/2, but no alterations in CaMKII and PP2A in hippocampus of SPS rats. On the other hand, the levels of both phosphorylated AKT and total SGK1, stress- and GSK-3β/ERK1/2-related proteins, were down-regulated. Interestingly, Overexpression of SGK1 increased the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and led to tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser396. These findings suggest that SPS exposure results in differential tau phosphorylation at different sites probably due to incongruous action between AKT-related GSK-3β activation and SGK1-related ERK1/2 inactivation, suggesting a link between SPS-induced PTSD and AD-associated tau pathogenic mechanisms.</AbstractText>"}

However, the extended time of storage inducing the rapid decline in spermatozoa quality limits the development of this technology. The molecular mechanisms underlying liquid storage of spermatozoa remain largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of liquid storage on functional quality of spermatozoa were assessed in goat (<i>Capra hircus</i>). The time-dependent decline in spermatozoa motility showed a strong correlation with the significant increase in apoptosis. Moreover, apoptosis-related ultrastructural changes were observed, especially the defects in mitochondria. A significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and changes in the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins indicated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation. Notably, the abnormally high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by liquid storage resulted in oxidative damage to mitochondria and accelerated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, as demonstrated by the addition of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, critical differentially expressed proteins involved in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and antioxidant defense were identified and profiled by quantitative proteomic analysis, facilitating the understanding of molecular regulation of ROS-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. These outcomes provide insights into the mechanisms underlying liquid storage of goat spermatozoa and enhance the progress of semen storage technology.</AbstractText>"}

A total of 381 differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed by analyzing 1044 BC tissues and 102 adjacent normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then, based on the association between each miRNAs and disease-free survival (DFS), we identified miRNA recurrence-related signature to construct a novel prognostic nomogram using Cox regression model. Target genes of the four miRNAs were analyzed via Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that a combination of the miRNA signature and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage had better predictive performance than that of TNM stage (0.710 vs 0.616, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, risk stratification analysis suggested that the miRNA-based model could significantly classify patients into the high- and low-risk groups in the two cohorts (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), and was independent of other clinical features. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the 46 target genes mainly enrichment in important cell biological processes, protein binding and cancer-related pathways.

PC's protumorigenic function requires direct interaction with tumor cells and contributes to the establishment of immunotolerance to tumor growth. Cancer cells up-regulate their own chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a process that delivers selective cytosolic proteins to lysosomes for degradation, with pro-oncogenic effects. However, the possible impact that cancer cells may have on CMA of surrounding host cells has not been explored. We analyzed the contribution of CMA to the GB-induced changes in PC biology. We have found that CMA is markedly up-regulated in PC in response to the oxidative burst that follows PC-GB cell interaction. Genetic manipulations to block the GB-induced up-regulation of CMA in PC allows them to maintain their proinflammatory function and to support the induction of effective antitumor T cell responses required for GB clearance. GB-induced up-regulation of CMA activity in PC is essential for their effective interaction with GB cells that help tumor growth. We show that CMA inhibition in PC promotes GB cell death and the release of high immunogenic levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), through deregulation of the expression of cell-to-cell interaction proteins and protein secretion. A GB mouse model grafted in vivo with CMA-defective PC shows reduced GB proliferation and effective immune response compared to mice grafted with control PC. Our findings identify abnormal up-regulation of CMA as a mechanism by which GB cells elicit the immunosuppressive function of PC and stabilize GB-PC interactions necessary for tumor cell survival.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

It is known that different mitochondrial matrix proteins undergo mitophagy with very different rates but, to date, the mechanism underlying this selectivity at the individual protein level has remained obscure. We now present evidence indicating that protein phosphorylation within the mitochondrial matrix plays a mechanistic role in regulating selective mitophagic degradation in yeast via involvement of the Aup1 mitochondrial protein phosphatase, as well as 2 known matrix-localized protein kinases, Pkp1 and Pkp2. By focusing on a specific matrix phosphoprotein reporter, we also demonstrate that phospho-mimetic and nonphosphorylatable point mutations at known phosphosites in the reporter increased or decreased its tendency to undergo mitophagy. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of the reporter protein is dynamically regulated during mitophagy in an Aup1-dependent manner. Our results indicate that structural determinants on a mitochondrial matrix protein can govern its mitophagic fate, and that protein phosphorylation regulates these determinants.</AbstractText>"}

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present at hundreds to thousands of copies per cell in a tissue-specific manner. mtDNA copy number also varies during aging and disease progression and therefore might be considered as a biomarker that mirrors alterations within the human body. Here, we present a new quantitative, highly sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method, droplet digital mitochondrial DNA measurement (ddMDM), to measure mtDNA copy number not only from cell populations but also from single cells. Our developed assay can generate data in as little as 3 h, is optimized for 96-well plates, and also allows the direct use of cell lysates without the need for DNA purification or nuclear reference genes. We show that ddMDM is able to detect differences between samples whose mtDNA copy number was close enough as to be indistinguishable by other commonly used mtDNA quantitation methods.

Prior work has shown that AvrRpm1 induces phosphorylation of AtRIN4, but homology modeling indicated that AvrRpm1 may be an ADP-ribosyl transferase. Here we show that AvrRpm1 induces ADP-ribosylation of RIN4 proteins from both Arabidopsis and soybean within two highly conserved nitrate-induced (NOI) domains. It also ADP-ribosylates at least ten additional Arabidopsis NOI domain-containing proteins. The ADP-ribosylation activity of AvrRpm1 is required for subsequent phosphorylation on threonine 166 of Arabidopsis RIN4, an event that is necessary and sufficient for RPM1 activation. We also show that the C-terminal NOI domain of AtRIN4 interacts with the exocyst subunits EXO70B1, EXO70E1, EXO70E2 and EXO70F1. Mutation of either EXO70B1 or EXO70E2 inhibited secretion of callose induced by the bacterial flagellin-derived peptide flg22. Substitution of RIN4 threonine 166 with aspartate enhanced the association of AtRIN4 with EXO70E2, which we posit inhibits its callose deposition function. Collectively, these data indicate that AvrRpm1 ADP-ribosyl transferase activity contributes to virulence by promoting phosphorylation of RIN4 threonine 166, which inhibits the secretion of defense compounds by promoting the inhibitory association of RIN4 with EXO70 proteins.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

We draw upon international research literatures spanning gerontology and population mental health, as well as major reports from global health agencies. Compared with older men, older women are more likely to experience common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, although the gender gap is smaller than it is at younger ages. In contrast, the mortality-related impacts of poor mental health, including suicide, are more severe for older men. These gendered patterns vary by country and other social contexts. Factors proposed to account for these findings include cultural and social norms, differentiation of gender roles, disadvantage and (dis)empowerment across the life course, and the coping styles of older men. However, little research has explicitly tested these explanations. Research to date has overwhelmingly focused on identifying differences in the mental health of older men and women. Notably, most studies have been restricted to binary comparisons, lacking the data to disentangle sex and gender dynamics, and few studies have examined the mental health of minority gendered adults in later life.

However, the effect of stent design on long-term durability of carotid artery stenting (CAS) is unknown. We compared the medium- to long-term risk of restenosis and ipsilateral stroke between patients treated with open-cell stents versus closed-cell stents in the ICSS (International Carotid Stenting Study). Methods- Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to CAS or endarterectomy and followed with duplex ultrasound for a median of 4.0 years. We analyzed data from patients with completed CAS procedures, known stent design, and available ultrasound follow-up. The primary outcome, moderate or higher restenosis (≥50%) was defined as a peak systolic velocity of &gt;1.3 m/s on ultrasound or occlusion of the treated internal carotid artery and analyzed with interval-censored models. Results- Eight hundred fifty-five patients were allocated to CAS. Seven hundred fourteen patients with completed CAS and known stent design were included in the current analysis. Of these, 352 were treated with open-cell and 362 with closed-cell stents. Moderate or higher restenosis occurred significantly less frequently in patients treated with open-cell (n=113) than closed-cell stents (n=154; 5-year risks were 35.5% versus 46.0%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88). There was no significant difference in the risk of severe restenosis (≥70%) after open-cell stenting (n=27) versus closed-cell stenting (n=43; 5-year risks, 8.6% versus 12.7%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.37-1.05). The risk of ipsilateral stroke beyond 30 days after treatment was similar with open-cell and closed-cell stents (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.35-1.75). Conclusions- Moderate or higher restenosis after CAS occurred less frequently in patients treated with open-cell stents than closed-cell stents.

Multinomial generalized logit models were generated to assess self-perception of aging by HIV-status. Most of the participants self-identified as white, former smokers, and had completed high school. HIV-positive individuals reported higher prevalence of comorbidities than HIV-negative individuals. After adjusting for covariates, positive age discrepancy (older subjective age) was positively associated with being HIV-positive and having less than a high school education, depressive symptoms, diabetes, and medium and low aging satisfaction. Low aging satisfaction was associated with being a current and former smoker and having depressive symptoms, diabetes, and no age and positive age discrepancy.

General practitioner (GP) out-of-hours (GPOOH) services have an essential role in supporting older people to remain living in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, but little is known about use of GPOOH services by this cohort. This research examines how rurality impacts accessibility and utilisation of GPOOH services by people aged 65 years or more in rural Ireland.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS'>Conducted in the mainly rural counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the north-east of Ireland, this research used a mixed methods approach. Questionnaires and focus groups were conducted with 48 older people in six locations across both counties. A thematic analysis was conducted on the data using NVivo software.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS'>The challenge for older rural populations includes difficulties accessing transport and the limited availability of support networks during times of a health crisis, especially at night. The present findings show such challenges are further compounded by a lack of information about available services. Rurality complicates each of these challenges, because it adds to the vulnerability of older adults. This is most acutely felt by those who live alone and those living the furthest from GPOOH treatment centres. The most important concern for older people, when unwell outside doctor surgery hours, is the need for access to medical care as quickly as possible. Inability to use GPOOH services leads many older people to seek help from accident and emergency departments, where faster access to clinical care is sometimes assumed.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS'>For rural-dwelling older people, becoming ill outside GP surgery hours is complex and the barriers faced are often insurmountable at times of greatest need. Worries about accessibility and lack of information give rise to a hesitancy to use GPOOH services in a population that is already known to be reluctant to ask for help, even when such help is justified. In turn, the lack of familiarity with what is a fundamental community health service further impacts the willingness of older adults to call on GPOOH services for help when needed. Addressing the impact of rurality on access and use of out-of-hours medical services is essential to enable more older adults to live longer in their rural homes and communities, supported by services that are responsive to their needs regardless of where they live. Given GPOOH is the only current alternative out-of-hours medical service to accident and emergency departments, more research is urgently needed on both accessibility of GPOOH services by older adults and the impact of inaccessibility on use of emergency services by older people in rural areas.</AbstractText>"}

This postovulatory aging (POA) seriously affects the oocyte quality and then impairs the subsequent fertilization and early embryo development, which should be avoided especially in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Resveratrol is an antioxidant substance that can scavenge free radicals and is effective in improving ovary functions. Here, mouse oocytes were used to investigate the effects and mechanisms of resveratrol on POA oocytes in vitro. With 1.0 µM resveratrol treatment during aging process, the rates of fertilization and blastocyst in POA oocytes increased significantly compared with those in the POA group. Resveratrol can reduce the loss of sperm binding sites by stabilizing Juno. Resveratrol can maintain the normal morphology of spindle and mitochondrion distribution and alleviate the levels of ROS and early apoptosis. Additionally, resveratrol can reduce the changes of H3K9me2. Therefore, resveratrol can significantly improve the quality of POA oocytes in vitro to enhance the rates of fertilization and blastocyst, which may be very helpful during the ART process.</AbstractText>"}

The use of large-scale and high-throughput cytogenomics technologies has led to a fast identification of several cancer candidate biomarkers associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. The advent of array comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing technologies has significantly improved the knowledge about cancer biology, underlining driver genes to guide targeted therapy development, drug-resistance prediction, and pharmacogenetics. However, few of these candidate biomarkers have made the transition to the clinic with a clear benefit for the patients. Technological progress helped to demonstrate that cellular heterogeneity plays a significant role in tumor progression and resistance/sensitivity to cancer therapies, representing the major challenge of precision cancer therapy. A paradigm shift has been introduced in cancer genomics with the recent advent of single-cell sequencing, since it presents a lot of applications with a clear benefit to oncological patients, namely, detection of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, mapping clonal evolution, monitoring the development of therapy resistance, and detection of rare tumor cell populations. It seems now evident that no single biomarker could provide the whole information necessary to early detect and predict the behavior and prognosis of tumors. The promise of precision medicine is based on the molecular profiling of tumors being vital the continuous progress of high-throughput technologies and the multidisciplinary efforts to catalogue chromosomal rearrangements and genomic alterations of human cancers and to do a good interpretation of the relation genotype-phenotype.</AbstractText>"}

Notwithstanding, only a small proportion of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are managed with PD. This may be related to the high glucose load that PD solutions in current use have on the patient. The effects of such excess glucose include the relatively early limitation of the ultrafiltration capacity of the peritoneal membrane, and the metabolic effects associated with hyperglycemia, e.g., decreased insulin sensitivity. This article describes the advantages that may be realized by the glucose-sparing effects of substituting part of the glucose load with other osmotically active metabolites, particularly L-carnitine. The latter is anticipated to have metabolic advantages of its own, especially as in PD patients, high plasma concentrations can be achieved in the absence of renal clearance. Besides its better biocompatibility, L-carnitine demonstrates anti-anemia action due to its effects on erythropoiesis, and positive effects on the longevity and deformability of erythrocytes. Observations from our trials on the use of carnitine-enriched PD solutions have demonstrated the effectiveness of L-carnitine as an efficient osmolyte in PD, and its favorable effect on the insulin sensitivity of the patients. The significance of these findings for future developments in the use of PD in the management of patients with ESRD is discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The various clinical features result from the massive accumulation of copper in the liver, cornea and basal ganglia. Although WD can be effectively treated with proper medicine, this disease is difficult to clearly diagnose due to its indefinite symptoms. In the current study, we achieved a positive correlation between clinical symptoms and the enzymatic activity of ceruloplasmin in WD patients. Furthermore, proteome profiles of plasma as well as network analysis demonstrated that fibrinogen is a critical indicator which is significantly unregulated in WD subjects in comparison to healthy donors and closely linked to pathogenesis of WD. Here, we applied 2DE-immunoblots and immunohistochemistry to verify the protein level and localization in situ. The enhanced expression of fibrinogen in the plasma of WD subjects with respect to that of healthy controls and patients with distinct disorders was also confirmed by utilizing clinical samples. As expected, application of high dose of copper induced expression of fibrinogen, while knockdown of ceruloplasmin also resulted in upregulation of fibrinogen as well as elimination of superoxide dismutase (SOD), leading to increased oxidative stress in cells. In summary, the liver injury or oxidative stress induced by the progression of WD may account for the obvious increase of fibrinogen, which in turn triggers inflammatory responses and interferes coagulation cascades; this finding sheds light on the early detection and diagnosis of WD.</AbstractText>"}

Sesamin reduced UVB-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression and inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation. Moreover, sesamin may regulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase pathways, which inhibit COX-2 expression. Sesamin could reduce UVB-induced inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia, collagen degradation, and wrinkle formation in hairless mice. It also reduced MMP-1, interleukin (IL-1), i-NOS, and NF-κB in the mouse skin. These results demonstrate that sesamin had antiphotodamage and anti-inflammatory activities. Sesamin has potential for use as a skin protection agent in antiphotodamage and skin care products.</AbstractText>"}

Thus, it is very interesting that the deletion of mitochondrial matrix peptidase LonP1 was observed to abolish embryogenesis, while deletion of the mitochondrial matrix peptidase Caseinolytic Mitochondrial Matrix Peptidase Proteolytic Subunit (ClpP) prolonged survival. To unveil the targets of each enzyme, we documented the global proteome of <i>LonP1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF), for comparison with <i>ClpP</i><sup>-/-</sup> depletion. Proteomic profiles of <i>LonP1</i><sup>+/-</sup> MEF generated by label-free mass spectrometry were further processed with the STRING (Search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes) webserver Heidelberg for protein interactions. ClpP was previously reported to degrade Eral1 as a chaperone involved in mitoribosome assembly, so ClpP deficiency triggers the accumulation of mitoribosomal subunits and inefficient translation. <i>LonP1</i><sup>+/-</sup> MEF also showed Eral1 accumulation, but no systematic effect on mitoribosomal subunits. In contrast to <i>ClpP</i><sup>-/-</sup> profiles, several components of the respiratory complex-I membrane arm, of the glutathione pathway and of lysosomes were accumulated, whereas the upregulation of numerous innate immune defense components was similar. Overall, LonP1, as opposed to ClpP, appears to have no effect on translational machinery, instead it shows enhanced respiratory dysfunction; this agrees with reports on the human CODAS syndrome (syndrome with cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, and skeletal anomalies) caused by LonP1 mutations.</AbstractText>"}

We aimed to compare young adults with elderly and investigate the effect of pectin supplementation on fecal microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) while using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. Fifty-two young adults and 48 elderly consumed 15 g/day sugar beet pectin or maltodextrin for four weeks. Fecal and exhaled breath samples were collected before and after the intervention period. Fecal samples were used for microbiota profiling by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and for analysis of SCFAs by gas chromatography (GC). Breath was used for VOC analysis by GC-tof-MS. Young adults and elderly showed similar fecal SCFA and exhaled VOC profiles. Additionally, fecal microbiota profiles were similar, with five genera significantly different in relative abundance. Pectin supplementation did not significantly alter fecal microbiota, SCFA or exhaled VOC profiles in elderly or young adults. In conclusion, aside from some minor differences in microbial composition, healthy elderly and young adults showed comparable fecal microbiota composition and activity, which were not altered by pectin supplementation.</AbstractText>"}

A mixture of SC and RF extracts (SC+RF) significantly protected against hydrogen peroxide-induced PC12 neuronal cell death. The neuroprotective effect of SC+RF on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in rats was evaluated using the passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze test. In the passive avoidance test, SC+RF-treated rats showed an increased latency to escape, compared to the scopolamine-treated rats. Moreover, SC+RF treatment significantly reduced escape latency in water maze test, compared to treatment with scopolamine alone. To verify the long-term memory, we performed probe test of water maze test. As a result, rat treated with SC+RF spent more time in the target quadrant. Consistent with enhancement of memory function, the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream molecules (pERK, pATK, and pCREB) are increased in SC+RF treatment in hippocampal area compared with scopolamine treated group. These results suggest that a mixture of SC and RF extracts may be a good therapeutic candidate for preventing mild cognitive impairment.</AbstractText>"}

At present, sexual dysfunction in the ageing male is poorly investigated and understood, and current treatment strategies aim at improving sexual desire and erectile function with limited data on ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunctions. In addition, men are often reticent to seek help for health concerns including sexual dysfunction.

IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 titers against diphtheria toxoid (DT), pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and pertactin (Prn) were measured in mice from 28 different inbred and wild-derived strains vaccinated with an aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted DTaP vaccine. The titers and duration of vaccine-specific IgG subclass responses were different among mouse strains, indicating that genetic factors contribute to this variation. Statistical associations were used to identify potential mechanisms that contribute to antibody production and longevity. This analysis showed that the mechanisms guiding the magnitude of antibody production were antigen-dependent for IgG1 but antigen-independent for IgG2b and IgG3. However, the mechanisms driving the longevity of antibody titers were antigen-independent for IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3. The ratio of IgG1 and IgG3 titers identified Th1 and Th2-prone mouse strains.

The literature on this topic was queried, 5048 papers were screened, and 16 studies were included, covering patients presenting different neuropsychological diseases. Our findings highlight the potential of the navigational task in virtual environments (VEs) for enhancing navigation and orientation abilities in patients with spatial memory disorders. The results are promising and suggest that VR training can facilitate neurorehabilitation, promoting brain plasticity processes. An overview of how VR-based training has been implemented is crucial for using these tools in clinical settings. Hence, in the current manuscript, we have critically debated the structure and the length of training protocols, as well as a different type of exploration through VR devices with different degrees of immersion.

There has been a surge of interest in developing cell-based therapies, focused particularly on the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from adult tissues. It seems that MSCs derived from synovial joint tissues exhibit superior chondrogenic ability, but their unclear distribution and low frequency actually limit their clinical application. To date, the influence of aging on synovial joint derived MSCs' biological characteristics and differentiation abilities remains unknown, and a full understanding of the mechanisms involved in cellular aging is lacking. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the presence of age-related alterations in synovial fluid MSCs and their influence on the potential ability of MSCs to differentiate toward chondrogenic phenotypes. Synovial fluid MSCs, isolated from healthy equine donors from 3 to 40 years old, were cultured in vitro and stimulated towards chondrogenic differentiation for up to 21 days. An equine model was chosen due to the high degree of similarity of the anatomy of the knee joint to the human knee joint and as spontaneous disorders develop that are clinically relevant to similar human disorders. The results showed a reduction in cell proliferation correlated with age and the presence of age-related tetraploid cells. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated the presence of morphological features correlated with aging such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and mitophagy. Alcian blue assay and real-time PCR data showed a reduction of efficiency in the chondrogenic differentiation of aged synovial fluid MSCs compared to young MSCs. All these data highlighted the influence of aging on MSCs' characteristics and ability to differentiate towards chondrogenic differentiation and emphasize the importance of considering age-related alterations of MSCs in clinical applications.</AbstractText>"}

To exert their biological function they must fold to acquire an appropriate three-dimensional conformation. Once their function is fulfilled, they need to be properly degraded to hamper any possible damage. Protein homeostasis or proteostasis comprises a complex interconnected network that regulates different steps of the protein quality control, from synthesis and folding, to degradation. Due to the primary role of proteins in cellular function, the integrity of this network is critical to assure functionality and health across lifespan. Proteostasis failure has been reported in the context of aging and neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, targeting the proteostasis elements emerges as a promising neuroprotective therapeutic approach to prevent or ameliorate the progression of these disorders. A variety of natural products are known to be neuroprotective by protein homeostasis interaction. In this review, we will focus on the current knowledge regarding the use of natural products as modulators of different components of the proteostasis machinery within the framework of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

In humans, aging is associated with lowered overall functioning and increased mortality out of the risk for various age-related diseases.

Royal jelly (RJ) is a natural product that is fed to bee queens throughout their entire life. Thanks to RJ, bee queens enjoy an excellent reproductive function and lengthened lifespan compared with bee workers, despite the fact that they have the same genome. This review aimed to investigate the effect of RJ and/or its components on lifespan/healthspan in various species by evaluating the most relevant studies. Moreover, we briefly discussed the positive effects of RJ on health maintenance and age-related disorders in humans. Whenever possible, we explored the metabolic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms through which RJ can modulate age-related mechanisms to extend lifespan. RJ and its ingredients-proteins and their derivatives e.g., royalactin; lipids e.g., 10-hydroxydecenoic acid; and vitamins e.g., pantothenic acid-improved healthspan and extended lifespan in worker honeybees <i>Apis mellifera</i>, <i>Drosophila Melanogaster</i> flies, <i>Gryllus bimaculatus</i> crickets, silkworms, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes, and mice. The longevity effect was attained via various mechanisms: downregulation of insulin-like growth factors and targeting of rapamycin, upregulation of the epidermal growth factor signaling, dietary restriction, and enhancement of antioxidative capacity. RJ and its protein and lipid ingredients have the potential to extend lifespan in various creatures and prevent senescence of human tissues in cell cultures. These findings pave the way to inventing specific RJ anti-aging drugs.

The transcription factor Forkhead box protein O3 (FOXO3a) is a core regulator of cellular homeostasis, stress response, and longevity since it can modulate a variety of stress responses upon nutrient shortage, oxidative stress, hypoxia, heat shock, and DNA damage. FOXO3a activity is regulated by post-translational modifications that drive its shuttling between different cellular compartments, thereby determining its inactivation (cytoplasm) or activation (nucleus and mitochondria). Depending on the stress stimulus and subcellular context, activated FOXO3a can induce specific sets of nuclear genes, including cell cycle inhibitors, pro-apoptotic genes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, autophagy effectors, gluconeogenic enzymes, and others. On the other hand, upon glucose restriction, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) -dependent FOXO3a mitochondrial translocation allows the transcription of oxidative phosphorylation (<i>OXPHOS</i>) genes, restoring cellular ATP levels, while in cancer cells, mitochondrial FOXO3a mediates survival upon genotoxic stress induced by chemotherapy. Interestingly, these target genes and their related pathways are diverse and sometimes antagonistic, suggesting that FOXO3a is an adaptable player in the dynamic homeostasis of normal and stressed cells. In this review, we describe the multiple roles of FOXO3a in cellular stress response, with a focus on both its nuclear and mitochondrial functions.</AbstractText>"}

A 2018 analysis from the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) in the US projected a best case scenario of an oversupply of more than 18,000 pharmacists in the year 2030. In this commentary, the limitations of this general health labor force analysis by the NCHWA are described. The goal of this work was to provide a more nuanced examination of the pharmacist labor demand in the US. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were utilized to examine, annually over a ten year period ending in 2017, the number of pharmacists, the ratio of pharmacists to persons living in the US, the ratio of pharmacists to older adults living in the US, and the ratio of medications to pharmacists. The number of pharmacists grew from 266,410 in 2008 to 309,330 in 2017. As anticipated, despite a growing US population, the ratio of people living in the US per pharmacist dropped unabated from 1141 to 1053 from 2008 to 2017, respectively. However, the reverse trend was observed for the ratio of persons 65 years or older per pharmacist. This ratio increased from 146.1 older adults to each pharmacist in 2008 to 164.3 in 2017. The accelerating demographic shift to an older population is also reversing an overall trend in the number of medications to pharmacist that will continue for the foreseeable future. While the ratio of medications to pharmacist dropped overall from 2008 to 2016, it has begun to rise again from 2016 to 2017. Beyond the increasing number of medications attributable to a rapidly aging population, there is a growing demand for clinical care from pharmacists due to the maturing environment of complex, costly medications for chronic disease treatment. As the portion of total health expenditure is increasingly devoted to medications and the US health delivery system continues its movement to community-based care, the demand for pharmacist care will require a larger number of pharmacists trained for advanced-practice care.</AbstractText>"}

These editing events differ among plant species and are relevant to developmental stages or are impacted by environmental conditions. Proteins of the MORF family are essential components of plant editosomes. One of the members, MORF9, is considered the core protein of the editing complex and is involved in the editing of most sites in chloroplasts. In this study, the phenotypes of a T-DNA insertion line with loss of <i>MORF9</i> and of the genetic complementation line of <i>Arabidopsis</i> were analyzed, and the editing efficiencies of plastid RNAs in roots, rosette leaves, and flowers from the <i>morf9</i> mutant and the wild-type (WT) control were compared by bulk-cDNA sequencing. The results showed that most of the known <i>MORF9</i>-associated plastid RNA editing events in rosette leaves and flowers were similarly reduced by <i>morf9</i> mutation, with the exception that the editing rate of the sites <i>ndhB-872</i> and <i>psbF-65</i> declined in the leaves and that of <i>ndhB-586</i> decreased only in the flowers. In the roots, however, the loss of MORF9 had a much lower effect on overall plastid RNA editing, with nine sites showing no significant editing efficiency change, including <i>accD-794</i>, <i>ndhD-383</i>, <i>psbZ-50,</i><i>ndhF-290</i>, <i>ndhD-878,</i><i>matK-706</i>, <i>clpP1-559</i>, <i>rpoA-200</i>, and <i>ndhD-674</i>, which were reduced in the other tissues. Furthermore, we found that during plant aging, <i>MORF9</i> mRNA level, but not the protein level, was downregulated in senescent leaves. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that MORF9-mediated RNA editing is tissue-dependent and the resultant organelle proteomes are pertinent to the specific tissue functions.</AbstractText>"}

In other words, NCDs may lead to disabilities. At the same time, people with disabilities are more vulnerable to NCDs, because of their underlying health condition, and vulnerability to poverty and exclusion from healthcare services. NCD programmes must expand their focus beyond prevention and treatment to incorporate rehabilitation for people living with NCDs, in order to maximize their functioning and well-being. Additionally, access to healthcare needs to be improved for people with disabilities so that they can secure their right to preventive, curative and rehabilitation services.

While sickle cell disease has a low risk of death in children and a high risk for morbidity during aging, SCT carries an early risk of death, graft-vs-host disease and infertility. Nevertheless, SCT offers at least 95% chance of cure with low risk of chronic graft-vs-host disease when a matched-sibling donor is available and the risks of infertility can be reduced by ovarian, sperm or testis cryopreservation. Thus, all available therapies such as hydroxyurea, transfusions and SCT should be presented to the parents, providers, and affected children and discussed with them from infancy. Furthermore, the use of these therapies should be adjusted to the severity of the disease and to local availabilities in order to choose the treatment offering the best benefit/risk ratio.</AbstractText>"}

Here we present evidence that the lower level of Nrf2 is closely associated with higher grade of IDD. The apoptosis and senescence of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) were exacerbated by Nrf2 knockdown, but suppressed by Nrf2 overexpression under oxidative stress. Based on findings that Kinsenoside could exert multiple pharmacological effects, we found that Kinsenoside rescued the NPC viability under oxidative stress and protected against apoptosis, senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in a Nrf2-dependent way. Further experiments revealed that Kinsenoside activated a signaling pathway of AKT-ERK1/2-Nrf2 in NPCs. Moreover, in vivo study showed that Kinsenoside ameliorated IDD in a puncture-induced model. Together, the present work suggests that Nrf2 is involved in the pathogenesis of IDD and shows the protective effects as well as the underlying mechanism of Kinsenoside on Nrf2 activation in NPCs.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we revealed the positive correlation between PRL-3 and stathmin in myeloid leukemia. Knockdown of the <i>PRL-3</i> gene by shRNA reduced the expression of downstream stathmin, suppressed cell proliferation, induced G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis, and inhibited migration and invasion in myeloid leukemia cells.

Here, we investigated the preventive effect of B-vitamin on PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced deleterious effects by focusing on anti-inflammation, antioxidant, synaptic remodeling and neurodevelopment. Pregnant mice were randomly divided into three groups including control group (mice subject to PBS only), model group (mice subject to both 30 μL PM<sub>2.5</sub> of 3.456 μg/μL and 10 mL/(kg·d) PBS), and intervention group (mice subject to both 30 μL PM<sub>2.5</sub> of 3.456 μg/μL and 10 mL/(kg·d) B-vitamin supplementation (folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 with concentrations at 0.06, 1.14 and 0.02 mg/mL, respectively)). In the current study B-vitamin significantly alleviated neurobehavioral impairment reflected in reduced social communication disorders, stereotyped repetitive behavior, along with learning and spatial memory impairment in PM<sub>2.5</sub>-stimulated mice offspring. Next, B-vitamin corrected synaptic loss and reduced mitochondrial damage in hippocampus of mice offspring, demonstrated by normalized synapse quantity, synaptic cleft, postsynaptic density (PSD) thickness and length of synaptic active area. Furthermore, significantly down-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β, and lipid peroxidation were found. We observed elevated levels of oxidant-related genes (SOD, GSH and GSH-Px). Moreover, decreased cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cells suggested inhibited PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced apoptosis by B-vitamin. Furthermore, B-vitamin increased neurogenesis by increasing EdU-positive cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of offspring.

Recently, a new array, the Illumina MethylationEPIC (EPIC) was introduced, with nearly double the number of probes as the 450K (∼850,000 probes). In this study, we test these newly added probes for age association using a large cohort of 754 DNAm profiles from blood samples assayed on the EPIC BeadChip, for individuals aged 0-88 years old. 52 AR CpG sites (Spearman's abs(rho) &gt;0.6 and P-value &lt;10<sup>-83</sup>) were identified, 21 of which were novel sites and mapped to 18 genes, nine of which (LHFPL4, SLC12A8, EGFEM1P, GPR158, TAL1, KIAA1755, LOC730668, DUSP16, and FAM65C) have never previously been reported to be associated with age. The data were subsequently split into a 527-sample training set and a 227-sample testing set to build and validate two age prediction models using elastic net regression and multivariate regression. Elastic net regression selected 425 CpG markers with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 2.6 years based on the testing set. To build a multivariate linear regression model, AR CpG sites with R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.5 at FDR &lt; 0.05 were input into stepwise regression to select the best subset for age prediction. The resulting six CpG markers were linearly modelled with age and explained 81% of age-correlated variation in DNAm levels. Age estimation accuracy using bootstrap analysis was 4.5 years, with 95% confidence intervals of 4.56 to 4.57 years based on the testing set. These results suggest that EPIC BeadChip probes for age estimation fall within the range of probes found on the previous Illumina HumanMethylation platforms in terms of their age-prediction ability.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The similarity of an image pair is then quantified by the proportion of keypoints they share using a novel Jaccard-like measure of set overlap. Experiments demonstrate the keypoint method to be highly efficient and accurate, using a set of 7536 T1-weighted MRIs pooled from four public neuroimaging repositories, including twins, non-twin siblings, and 3334 unique subjects.

Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia. Currently we only partially understand some of the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to development of the disease in aging individuals. In this study, Switch Miner software was used to identify key switch genes in the brain whose expression may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The results indicate that switch genes are enriched in pathways involved in the proteasome, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and metabolism in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex. Network analysis identified the krupel like factor 9 (KLF9), potassium channel tetramerization domain 2 (KCTD2), Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) and chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1) as key transcriptional regulators of switch genes in the brain of AD patients.

Moreover, alexithymia has been linked to cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Our aim was to explore the prevalence of alexithymia and its associations with neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and CV risk factors in a well-controlled HIV-positive population. We consecutively enrolled 140 HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy and 35 healthy subjects matched for age, education and gender. In all participants alexithymia was explored by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. For HIV-positive subjects also data about CV risk factors were collected, and a comprehensive neuropsychological examination was administered; HAND was defined according to Frascati criteria. Patients and controls did not differ in the proportion of alexithymic status (10% vs. 11%; p=0.761). Among HIV-positive patients, alexithymic participants presented a higher prevalence of diabetes (21% vs. 3%, p=0.035) and hypertension (36% vs. 13%, p= 0.037) compared to non-alexithymic. About 30% (n=41) of HIV-positive patients met criteria for asymptomatic HAND. Alexithymia was not independently associated with a higher risk of HAND (p=0.189). Analyzing each cognitive domain, alexithymia showed an independent association with an abnormal performance (OR 1.08; p=0.037) only in psychomotor speed. In conclusion, in the context of a well-controlled HIV infection, we found a low prevalence of alexithymia comparable to healthy controls. Alexithymia was linked to higher risk of CV disease in the HIV-positive population, but with a rate similar to that previously estimated in the HIV-negative alexithymic. Finally, alexithymia was clearly associated to cognitive impairment only in the psychomotor speed domain, suggesting a common fronto-striatal system dysregulation.</AbstractText>"}

To assess if this process is a relevant source for CCN in the atmosphere, the reaction rate at atmospheric conditions must be known. Here we investigate the increase in CCN activity of soot particles rich in organic carbon at O<sub>3</sub> concentrations ranging from 0-200 ppb and between 5 and 35 °C. We operated an ∼3 m<sup>3</sup> aerosol chamber as a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor which allows for aging times of up to 12 h and beyond and of particle size selection prior to the aging step. We applied the activation time (<i>t</i><sub>act</sub>) concept to retrieve kinetic data. It was found that 100 nm soot particles can be CCN-active down to supersaturations of 0.3% after 12 h of exposure to 200 ppb O<sub>3</sub> at 35 °C. The reaction rate was found to be not directly proportional to the O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Instead, a Langmuir-type reaction kinetic was found to be the best fit to parametrize the reaction rates. The initial reaction step is therefore the adsorption of O<sub>3</sub> molecules, which could be detected by an increase in the particle diameter of up to 3.7 nm within several minutes after exposure. The increase in particle diameter agrees well with the calculated change in the O<sub>3</sub> surface coverage, which was obtained from CCN activation data under the assumption of a Langmuir-sorption isotherm. Further, we found that a temperature increase from 5 to 35 °C increases the reaction rate by a factor of 5 which corresponds to an activation energy of 38.5 kJ·mol<sup>-1</sup>. Extrapolation to atmospheric conditions allows for the conclusion that the temperature is as important as the O<sub>3</sub> concentration for the CCN activation of soot particles within the atmospheric range.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we report that doxorubicin (DOX)-pretreated or replicative senescent stromal cells (WI-38 and HUVEC) promote colorectal cancer (CRC) cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo. These pro-tumorigenic effects were attenuated by exogenous administration of Klotho, an anti-aging factor. We subsequently identified several senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-associated genes, including CCL2, which were significantly upregulated in both types of senescent stromal cells during replication and DNA damage-induced senescence. Importantly, we found that the secretion of CCL2 by senescent stromal cells was significantly higher than that seen in nonsenescent cells or in senescent cells pretreated with Klotho. Notably, CCL2 was found to accelerate CRC cell proliferation and invasion, while this effect could be blocked by administration of a specific CCR2 antagonist. We further show that Klotho can suppress NF-κB activation during DOX-induced senescence and thus block CCL2 transcription. Low expression of Klotho, or high expression of CCL2 in patient tumor tissues, correlated with poor overall survival of CRC patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that senescent stromal cells are linked to progression of CRC. Klotho can suppress the senescent stromal cell-associated triggering of CRC progression by inhibiting the expression of SASP factors including CCL2. The identification of key SASP factors such as CCL2 may provide potential therapeutic targets for improving CRC therapy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

We previously reported the causal relation of Jagged1 in ECs and the thickening of the arterial wall in aging mice. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the correlation between insulin‑like growth factor‑binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), one of the secretory proteins regulated by Jagged1, and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and patient age, as well as its effect on EC senescence. First, microarray analysis was performed to screen the differentially expressed genes regulated by Jagged1 in human coronary arterial ECs (HCAECs). Inhibition of the Jagged1 expression using a small interfering RNA knockdown method in HCAECs led to the upregulation of 17 and the downregulation of 78 genes by &gt;3‑fold, and IGFBP1 was confirmed to be a secretory protein expressed by HCAECs and regulated by Jagged1. Subsequently, in 112 consecutively enrolled patients with acute chest pain who underwent coronary angiography, the circulating level of IGFBP1 was found to be positively correlated with age (r=0.512, P&lt;0.001) and Synergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score (r=0.409, P&lt;0.001). Among age‑comparable patients, the circulating IGFBP1 level was found to be increased in patients with higher SYNTAX scores. In cultured HCAECs, IGFBP1 was shown to protect ECs against passage‑ or H2O2‑induced senescence, and these protective effects of IGFBP1 may be partially reversed by LY294002, a known Akt signaling inhibitor. Therefore, the results of the present study suggested that, as a downstream protein of Jagged1, IGFBP1 was correlated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in aging patients, and the increase of circulating IGFBP1 levels with aging may be an adaptive response to counter HCAEC senescence through Akt signaling.</AbstractText>"}

It is generally recognized that D‑galactose induces oxidative stress or affects protein modifications via receptors for advanced glycated end products in a variety of species. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of astrocytes in D‑galactose‑induced brain aging in vitro. We found that D‑galactose treatment significantly suppressed cell viability and induced cellular senescence. In addition, as of the accumulation of senescent cells, we proposed that the senescence‑associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can stimulate age‑related pathologies and chemoresistance in brain. Consistently, senescent astrocytic CRT cells induced by D‑galactose exhibited increases in the levels of IL‑6 and IL‑8 via NF‑κB activation, which are major SASP components and inflammatory cytokines. Conditioned medium prepared from senescent astrocytic CRT cells significantly promoted the viability of brain tumor cells (U373‑MG and N2a). Importantly, conditioned medium greatly suppressed the cytotoxicity of U373‑MG cells induced by temozolomide, and reduced the protein expression levels of neuron marker neuron‑specific class III β‑tubulin, but markedly increased the levels of c‑Myc in N2a cells. Thus, our findings demonstrated that D‑galactose treatment might mimic brain aging, and that D‑galactose could contribute to brain inflammation and tumor progression through inducing the accumulation of senescent‑secretory astrocytes.</AbstractText>"}

One of its major characteristics is the reduction of autophagic activity. However, to date, few studies have assessed whether incremental load training is able to improve the occurrence of renal fibrosis caused by natural aging and the underlying mechanisms. In the present study involving male C57/BL mice, an elderly exercise group (OY group) was subjected to progressive load‑increasing rotary‑bar training (5 days/week, lasting for 6 weeks), with an elderly control group (OC group) and a young control group (YC group) used as controls. Renal fibrosis and autophagy‑associated indicators were assessed by Masson's staining, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analysis, western blotting, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. The results suggested that collagen deposition in the basal part of the renal tubular epithelium and glomeruli in the OY group was significantly lower than that in the OC group. In the OC group, the protein expression levels of E‑cadherin, Beclin 1 and light chain 3 were significantly decreased, and increases in α‑smooth muscle actin‑positive signals were observed in the glomerular matrix and renal capsule wall. Furthermore, the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 and its downstream signaling molecules TGF‑β‑activated kinase 1 (TAK1), mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK3) and p38MAPK were downregulated following training. The present study confirmed that incremental load training may improve renal fibrosis in aged mice by regulating the TGF‑β1/TAK1/MMK3/p38MAPK signaling pathway and inducing the activation of autophagy to reduce the synthesis of extracellular matrix and delay the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. The present study provides a novel experimental basis for the intervention of incremental load training to prevent senile renal fibrosis.</AbstractText>"}

In the present study, we evaluated whether SIP-SII, a sulphated derivative of the polysaccharide in <i>Sepiella maindroni</i> (spineless cuttlefish) ink used in traditional Chinese medicine, could attenuate resistance to FGFR inhibition in bladder cancer cells. In vitro assays indicated that SIP-SII reduced cell viability and migration, restricted cell cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in parallel with decreased AKT phosphorylation and downregulation of CDK4, MMP2, and Bcl-2 in RT112 and JMSU1 cells. Synergistic effects on cell viability were observed when SIP-SII was combined with the small-molecule FGFR inhibitor AZD4547. Specific Akt targeting by SIP-SII was suggested by the fact that neither Akt knockdown nor the selective PI3K inhibitor BKM120 enhanced the inhibitory effects of SIP-II, while expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant rescued SIP-SII effects. Furthermore, subcutaneous transplantation of RT112 xenografts confirmed the superiority and tolerability of combined SIP-SII and AZD4547 administration over monotherapy regimens.

Here, we show that most MuSCs in overloaded muscle, unlike MuSCs in regenerating muscle, proliferate in the absence of MyoD expression. Mechanistically, MuSCs in overloaded muscle sustain the expression of <i>Heyl</i>, a Notch effector gene, to suppress MyoD expression, which allows effective MuSC proliferation on myofibers and beneath the basal lamina. Although <i>Heyl</i>-knockout mice show no impairment in an injury model, in a hypertrophy model, their muscles harbor fewer new MuSC-derived myonuclei due to increased MyoD expression and diminished proliferation, which ultimately causes blunted hypertrophy.

In this study, we systematically investigated the photochemistry of soot in the aqueous phase. Soot releases dissolved black carbon into the aqueous phase during photoreactions, which is attributed to the phototransformation of the nonpolar unsaturated C-H species in soot to polar carbonyl-containing species. More importantly, we found that soot suspensions, particularly those of the dissolved part of soot, were effective photosensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). The <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> apparent quantum yield of the dissolved part reached 33 ± 2% under 377 nm irradiation, which is an order of magnitude higher than those of most types of well-studied dissolved organic matter in water. As a result, soot could impact the environmental fate of coexisting organic contaminants, such as the photodegradation of bisphenol A. This study will not only give insight into the photochemistry of soot in the liquid phase but also reveal the significant implications of soot photoaging in the aqueous phase by the release and degradation of organic matter.</AbstractText>"}

The TERT associations include proper folding, intracellular TERT transport, metabolism, mitochondrial ROS function, inflammation, cell division, cell death, and gene expression, in addition to the well-known telomere maintenance. While increase of cell cycle inhibitors promote aging, in cancer, the cell cycle check-point regulators are ambushed in favor of cell proliferation, while cytoplasmic TERT protects a cell cycle inhibitor in oxidative stress. The oncogene cMyc regulates gene expression for increased expression of TERT, and reduction of cell cycle inhibitors-the perfect storm for cancer promotion.

All other groups either lost or did not change weight. The extracellular-to-intracellular water (ECW/ICW) ratio was significantly elevated for the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and for males (<i>p</i> = 0.009) at completion of the study. TNF-α and leptin levels were positively correlated within the MI group at the end of the study.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>A decrease in leptin in the MI group corresponded to higher appetite and weight gain. The elevated ECW/ICW ratio indicates an inflammatory response in the MI group. This gender-specific response may be based on hormone-specific regulation of food intake.

CVD risk rises with age, yet for women there is a rapid increase in CVD risk that occurs after the onset of menopause. This observation suggests the presence of factors in the middle-aged women that accelerate the progression of CVD independent of chronological aging. Leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is a well-established protective factor against CVD. However, its role in attenuating atherogenic lipid profile changes and CVD risk in post-menopausal women has not been well-established. The present study is part of the Estrogenic Regulation of Muscle Apoptosis (ERMA) study, a population-based cohort study in which middle-aged Caucasian women (47-55) were classified into pre-menopausal, peri-menopausal, and post-menopausal groups based on follicle stimulating hormone levels and bleeding patterns. Comprehensive questionnaires, laboratory visits, anthropometric measurements, and physical activity monitoring by accelerometers were used to characterize the menopausal groups and serum lipid profiles were analyzed to quantify CV (cardiovascular) risk factors. Based on our findings, LTPA may attenuate menopause-associated atherogenic changes in the serum CV risk factors of healthy middle-aged women. However, LTPA does not seem to entirely offset the lipid profile changes associated with the menopausal transition.</AbstractText>"}

However, studies on its longitudinal effect on the neural mechanisms of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for treatment purposes are still lacking in the literature. In this clinical study, we assess the longitudinal effects of ATs on MCI patients using two methods: (i) Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA-K, Korean version), and (ii) the hemodynamic response (HR) analyses using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS signals of a working memory (WM) task were acquired from the prefrontal cortex. Twelve elderly MCI patients and 12 healthy people were recruited as target and healthy control (HC) groups, respectively. Each group went through an fNIRS scanning procedure three times: The initial data were obtained without any ATs, and subsequently a total of 24 AT sessions were conducted for MCI patients (i.e., MCI-0: the data prior to ATs, MCI-1: after 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks, MCI-2: another 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks). The mean HR responses of all MCI-0-2 cases were lower than those of HCs. To compare the effects of AT on MCI patients, MoCA-K results, temporal HR data, and spatial activation patterns (i.e., <i>t</i>-maps) were examined. In addition, analyses of functional connectivity (FC) and graph theory upon WM tasks were conducted. With ATs, (i) the averaged MoCA-K test scores were improved (MCI-1, <i>p</i> = 0.002; MCI-2, <i>p</i> = 2.9<i>e</i><sup>-4</sup>); (ii) the mean HR response of WM tasks was increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); and (iii) the <i>t</i>-maps of MCI-1 and MCI-2 were enhanced. Furthermore, an increased FC in the prefrontal cortex in both MCI-1/MCI-2 cases in comparison to MCI-0 was obtained (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and an increasing trend in the graph theory parameters was observed. All these findings reveal that ATs have a positive impact on improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. In conclusion, ATs can be used as a therapeutic tool for MCI patients as a non-pharmacological method (Clinical trial registration number: KCT 0002451 https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/).</AbstractText>"}

They play key roles in brain development, and physiology during life and aging. Equipped with a variety of molecular sensors and through the various functions they can fulfill, they are critically involved in maintaining the brain's homeostasis. In Alzheimer disease (AD), microglia reaction was initially thought to be incidental and triggered by amyloid deposits and dystrophic neurites. However, recent genome-wide association studies have established that the majority of AD risk loci are found in or near genes that are highly and sometimes uniquely expressed in microglia. This leads to the concept of microglia being critically involved in the early steps of the disease and identified them as important potential therapeutic targets. Whether microglia reaction is beneficial, detrimental or both to AD progression is still unclear and the subject of intense debate. In this review, we are presenting a state-of-knowledge report intended to highlight the variety of microglial functions and pathways shown to be critically involved in AD progression. We first address both the acquisition of new functions and the alteration of their homeostatic roles by reactive microglia. Second, we propose a summary of new important parameters currently emerging in the field that need to be considered to identify relevant microglial targets. Finally, we discuss the many obstacles in designing efficient therapeutic strategies for AD and present innovative technologies that may foster our understanding of microglia roles in the pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to fly over various microglial functions to make a general and reliable report of the current knowledge regarding microglia's involvement in AD and of the new research opportunities in the field.</AbstractText>"}

This represents a major knowledge gap in idiopathic and genetic forms of PD. Among various possible key factors postulated, iron metabolism has been widely suggested to be involved with fueling oxidative stress, a known factor in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the correlation between iron and DA neuron loss, specifically in the SN, has not been described in experimental animal models with great detail, with most studies utilizing rodents and, rarely, non-human primates. In the present study, aiming to gain further evidence of a pathological role of iron in PD, we have examined the correlation of iron with DA neuron loss in a non-human primate model of PD induced by MPTP. We report a significant iron accumulation accompanied by both DA degeneration in the SN and motor deficits in the monkey that displayed the most severe PD pathology and behavioral deficits. The other two monkeys subjected to MPTP displayed less severe PD pathologies and motor deficits, however, their SN iron levels were significantly lower than controls. These findings suggest that high iron may indicate and contribute to heightened MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced PD pathology in late or severe stages of PD, while depressed levels of iron may signal an early stage of disease. Similarly, using a cell culture preparation, we have found that high doses of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), a factor known to enhance iron accumulation, increased MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced cell death in U251 and SH-SY5Y cells, and even in control cells. However, at low dose FAC restored or increased the viability of U251 and SH-SY5Y cells in the absence or presence of MPP<sup>+</sup>. These observations imply that high levels of iron likely contribute to or heighten MPP<sup>+</sup> toxicity in the later stages of PD. While we report reduced iron levels in the earlier stages of MPTP induced PD, the significance of these changes remains to be determined.</AbstractText>"}

Two hundred and thirteen participants (mean age = 72.4 years; 59.2% women) were recruited (control group of a randomised controlled trial). A FROP-Com assessment was completed at a home visit within 2 weeks of ED discharge. Data on falls and injurious falls requiring medical attention were collected via monthly falls calendars for the next 12 months. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity of a high-risk FROP-Com classification (score ≥ 19) in predicting a fall and injurious falls requiring medical attention. Fifty per cent of participants fell, with 60.4% of falls requiring medical attention. Thirty-two per cent were classified as high, 49% as moderate and 19% low falls risk. Low sensitivity was achieved for the FROP-Com high-risk classification for predicting falls (43.4%) and injurious falls (34.4%), although specificity was high (79.4% and 78.6%, respectively). Despite the FROP-Com's low predictive accuracy, the high fall rate and high falls risk of the sample suggest that older people who fall, present to ED and are discharged home are at high risk of future falls. In high-falls-risk populations such as in this study, the FROP-Com is not a valid tool for classifying risk of falls or injurious falls. Its potential value may instead be in identifying risk factors for falling to direct tailoring of falls prevention interventions to reduce future falls.</AbstractText>"}

For 6 months, the experimental group had biweekly meetings, participating in a multimodal approach based on a combination of simultaneous physical, mental, and social activities. At pre-test and post-test, both experimental and control subjects underwent a neuropsychological assessment, including tests to measure attention, verbal and spatial memory, language, constructional praxis, executive functions, processing speed, and intelligence.

We combined data from two population-based Swedish studies of individuals aged 80 + years, assessed every 2 years (OCTO-3 measurement occasions, OCTO-Twin-5 measurement occasions) yielding 607 participants (66% female). The results confirmed that both objective and subjective memory declined over time. The association between the slope of objective memory and subjective memory was statistically significant for women but not for men. This pattern remained after accounting for age and depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that, in population-based samples of the oldest old, women seem to show better metacognitive abilities in detecting and reporting changes in memory.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 13 persons aged 67-70 years living in ordinary housing in Sweden, followed by a qualitative content analysis. Findings suggest that the home becomes progressively important after retirement. Not only the immediate home environment but also local neighbourhoods influence perceptions about home. Home brings emotional and social benefits but also worries about how to cope with complex home ambivalence when reflecting upon future housing arrangements. The findings suggest that it is important to consider the role of perceived aspects of home for health and well-being in early phases of the ageing process.

Approximately 54% of clients used a minimum volume and number of HACC services; 25% belonged to three complex care use clusters (referring to higher volume and number of services), while the remainder were intermediate users. The initiation of HACC use was significantly associated with (1) living in remote/inner/regional areas, (2) being widowed or divorced, (3) having difficulty in managing income, (4) not receiving Veterans' Affairs benefits, (5) having chronic conditions, (6) reporting lower scores on the SF-36 health-related quality of life, and (7) poor/fair self-rated health. Our findings highlight the importance of providing a range of services to meet the diverse care needs of older women, especially in the community setting.</AbstractText>"}

Our analyses are based on linked Scottish administrative health and social care data, including 79,983 hospital stays for 43,753 patients aged 65 or over. Our results show that dementia patients are more likely to be discharged to care institutions compared with non-dementia patients (odds ratio = 17). Further analyses reveal that this can be partially explained by the fact that dementia patients are more likely to have injury-related admissions and long hospital stays. This indirect effect accounts for around 6% of the total effect. We also investigate the effect of receiving home care, finding no evidence that it influences the likelihood of institutionalisation from hospitals in older people.</AbstractText>"}

Ninety sarcopenic men (mean age 88.6 years; age range 85-101 years) were divided into three groups: TC group, WBV group, and control (CON) group. Patients in the two treatment groups received 8 weeks of training in either TC or WBV, while the control group received reminders not to change their level of physical exercise or lifestyle. Patients in all groups also received health information related to sarcopenia. Muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance [balance, gait speed, timed-up-and-go test (TUGT), and five-times-sit-to-stand test (FTSST)] were analyzed and compared among the three groups. Finally, seventy-nine subjects completed the study (TC <i>n</i> = 24; WBV <i>n</i> = 28; and CON 27). Muscle strength was significantly increased in the TC and WBV groups compared to the control group (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.01). Following 8 weeks of exercise, improvements were observed in all physical performance tests for the TC and WBV groups (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.05). The improvement in balance was greater in the TC group than the WBV group. Time × Group effects revealed significant improvements in muscle strength in the lower extremities (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.05) and physical performance (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.01) in both the TC and WBV groups. Changes in muscle mass, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, did not significantly differ between groups. These findings indicate that TC and WBV are effective treatments for improving muscle strength and physical performance in sarcopenic men in advanced old age.</AbstractText>"}

Past literature has generally found a U-shaped relationship between parity, age at first birth, and several health-related outcomes. However, these findings differed to some extent depending on the country under analysis and on the measures of health considered. As such, using wave 3 (2008-2009) and 5 (2013) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this work aimed to answer the question: 'Are fertility histories associated with the presence of chronic conditions later in life in Europe?' The analysis included 11 European countries and compared results using two different measures of chronic conditions: self-reported chronic or long-term illness and chronic diseases diagnosed by a doctor. Results showed that age at first birth is more relevant than parity for health outcomes at older ages. Moreover, in socio-democratic and continental countries, the association between fertility and chronic conditions-in particular between age at first birth and long-term illnesses-is statistically significant among women, but not among men. Finally, the association between fertility history and health was similar when using self-reported measures and chronic diseases diagnosed by a doctor.</AbstractText>"}

Although microRNA-375-3p (miR-375) is considered a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers, the mechanism of miR-375 in the regulation of drug resistance in CRC remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the chemosensitivity of miR-375 to 5FU in CRC from biological and clinical aspects. We found that miR-375 was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and low miR-375 expression was strongly correlated with poor overall survival in CRC patients. Overexpression of miR-375 sensitized CRC cells to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Further mechanistic analysis demonstrated that miR-375 enhanced CRC cell sensitivity to 5FU by directly targeting YAP1 and SP1. MiR-375 downregulated YAP1, resulting in reduced expression of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway downstream genes CTGF, cyclin D1 and BIRC5 (also known as survivin). Overall, miR-375 was confirmed as a prospective molecular biomarker in the chemoresistance and prognosis of CRC patients, and the synergy between miR-375 and chemotherapeutic drugs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC patients, especially with chemoresistance.</AbstractText>"}

As senescent cells persist in tissues, they cause local inflammation and are harmful to surrounding cells, contributing to aging. Generally, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, are disorders of aging. The contribution of cellular senescence to neurodegeneration is still unclear. SATB1 is a DNA binding protein associated with Parkinson's disease. We report that SATB1 prevents cellular senescence in post-mitotic dopaminergic neurons. Loss of SATB1 causes activation of a cellular senescence transcriptional program in dopamine neurons both in human stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and in mice. We observed phenotypes that are central to cellular senescence in SATB1 knockout dopamine neurons in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that SATB1 directly represses expression of the pro-senescence factor p21 in dopaminergic neurons. Our data implicate senescence of dopamine neurons as a contributing factor in the pathology of Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

By using an ex vivo organ culture of vibrissae follicles, conditional Meis1 loss causes retardation in hair growth, accompanied by defects in cell proliferation of hair matrix cells. This cell proliferation defect is partly rescued by the addition of culture supernatants derived from Meis1-sufficient but not -deficient DP cells.

The efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is well supported by many studies, instead in primary prevention it remains controversial, especially in the aftermath of the publication in 2018 of three novel primary prevention randomized clinical trials, showing that the benefit of low-dose aspirin, although additive to that of statin, is counterbalanced by an excess of (mainly gastrointestinal) bleeding events. The signal for a net benefit seems to be even more controversial in the elderly starting aspirin after the age of 70 years. While international guidelines have promptly downgraded their recommendations to more conservative indications, the practicing clinician is called to make the effort to individualize the treatment, after careful evaluation of the haemorrhagic risk vis-a-vis the risk to develop, in the mid-term and long-term follow-up, major cardiovascular events or cancer. This is a particularly complex task, given the different immediate and long-term impact of diverse outcomes on health, the dynamic nature over time of the benefit/risk balance, prompting periodic re-assessments of its indication, and the interindividual variability in aspirin response. The chemopreventive properties of aspirin, anticipated by a large body of epidemiological and mechanistic evidence, are awaiting their final confirmation by the long-term follow-up of the latest trials specifically designed to assess this endpoint, with the expectation to subvert the delicate benefit/risk balance of aspirin in primary prevention. This review is intended to provide an interpretation of past and current evidence to guide clinical decision making on the contemporary patient.</AbstractText>"}

Increasing experimental evidence suggests that misfolded disease proteins exhibit prion-like properties, including the ability to seed corruptive templating and self-propagation along axons. Direct evidence for transneuronal spread in patients, however, remains limited. To test predictions made by the transneuronal spread hypothesis in human tissues, we asked whether tau deposition within axons of the corticospinal and corticopontine pathways can be predicted based on clinical syndromes and cortical atrophy patterns seen in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Sixteen patients with Pick's disease, 21 with corticobasal degeneration, and 3 with FTLD-MAPT were included, spanning a range of clinical syndromes across the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum. Cortical involvement was measured using a neurodegeneration score, a tau score, and a composite score based on semiquantitative ratings and complemented by an MRI-based cortical atrophy W-map based on antemortem imaging. Midbrain cerebral peduncle and pontine base descending fibers were divided into three subregions, representing prefrontopontine, corticospinal, and parieto-temporo-occipital fiber pathways. Tau area fraction was calculated in each subregion and related to clinical syndrome and cortical measures. Within each clinical syndrome, there were predicted relationships between cortical atrophy patterns and axonal tau deposition in midbrain cerebral peduncle and pontine base. Between syndromes, contrasting and predictable patterns of brainstem axonal tau deposition emerged, with, for example, greater tau in prefrontopontine fibers in behavioral variant FTD and in corticospinal fibers in corticobasal syndrome. Finally, semiquantitative and quantitative cortical degeneration scores predicted brainstem axonal tau deposition based on anatomical principles. Taken together, these findings provide important human evidence in support of axonal tau spreading in patients with specific forms of tau-related neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is the most potent phosphate regulator. Observational studies suggest that high levels of FGF23 are related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this work, we determined the levels of both the intact and the carboxi-terminal fragments of circulating FGF23 in 133 patients with established cardiovascular disease, the expression of FGF23, its receptors 1 and 3, and its co-receptor Klotho in vascular fragments of aorta, carotid and femoral in 43 out of this group of patients, and in a control group of 20 organ donors. Patients with atherosclerosis and vascular calcification presented increased levels of FGF23 respect to the control group. Vascular immunoreactivity for FGF23 was also significantly increased in patients with vascular calcification as compared to patients without calcification and to controls. Finally, gene expression of <i>FGF23</i> and <i>RUNX2</i> were also higher and directly related in vascular samples with calcification. Conversely, expression of <i>Klotho</i> was reduced in patients with cardiovascular disease when comparing to controls. In conclusion, our findings link the calcification of the vascular tissue with the expression of FGF23 in the vessels and with the elevation of circulating levels this hormone.</AbstractText>"}

Assessment of the neurotoxic effects caused by urban PM is complicated by variations of composition from source, location, and season. We compared several in vitro cell-based assays in relation to their in vivo neurotoxicity for NF-κB transcriptional activation, nitric oxide induction, and lipid peroxidation. These studies compared batches of nPM, a nanosized subfraction of PM2.5, extracted as an aqueous suspension, used in prior studies. In vitro activities were compared with in vivo responses of mice chronically exposed to the same batch of nPM. The potency of nPM varied widely between batches for NF-κB activation, analyzed with an NF-κB reporter in human monocytes. Three independently collected batches of nPM had corresponding differences to responses of mouse cerebral cortex to chronic nPM inhalation, for levels of induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglial activation (Iba1), and soluble Aβ40 &amp; -42 peptides. The in vitro responses of BV2 microglia for NO-production and lipid peroxidation also differed by nPM batch, but did not correlate with in vivo responses. These data confirm that batches of nPM can differ widely in toxicity. The in vitro NF-κB reporter assay offers a simple, high throughput screening method to predict the in vivo neurotoxic effects of nPM exposure.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While total concentrations of PAHs were rather stable during storage for 561 days at 4 °C, PAH accessibility declined by 95% due to atmospheric carbonation. The formation of carbonates was evidenced by an increase of inorganic soil carbon and by carbonate coatings on black soil particles (SEM-EDX) that could be dissolved by providing neutral to acidic soil conditions. Subjecting soil (252 days of storage) to biodegradation at pH 7 resulted in a degraded fraction of PAHs equivalent to the accessible PAH fraction of soil as received (PAHs with log K<sub>ow</sub> &lt;5). The present study addresses important interactions and relationships between carbonation of soil, aging of PAHs in soil and related changes in PAH accessibility. A main finding was the reversibility of this retention mechanism, a changing environment (e.g. reduction of pH below 8) can result in a rise of accessible PAHs and consequently in an increase of exposure and associated risk.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

As adult cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated cells and opportunities for heart transplantation are very limited, regenerative medicine may become a game changer in heart failure treatment. To develop strategies for generating cardiomyocytes, vascular cells, and other supporting cells, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of cardiovascular differentiation during development and from pluripotent stem cells. Master regulators for cardiovascular differentiation can generate new cardiomyocytes and vascular cells directly from other differentiated cells such as fibroblasts. Fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed into cardiomyocytes by overexpressing a combination of 3 cardiac-specific transcription factors (Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5) both in vitro and in vivo, which restores cardiac function after myocardial infarction in mice. Moreover, a direct reprogramming-based approach can be used to identify new key regulators of the cardiovascular mesoderm, which can differentiate into all 3 types of cardiovascular cells including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. This review provides a perspective on how key regulators for cardiovascular differentiation and regeneration can be identified and used to develop new treatments for heart failure.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, the majority of SRE studies have been conducted using trait adjective paradigms, which lack ecological validity; memory for narrative information has real-world importance and has been shown to decline in healthy aging and, to a greater extent, in aMCI. The present study investigated whether self-referential processing promotes memory for narrative information in healthy aging and, for the first time, in aMCI. The promotion of recollection (vivid re-experiencing of an event) through self-referential processing, termed the Self-Reference Recollection Effect (SRRE; Conway and Dewhurst, 1995), was also examined, as was the potential impact of material valence on the SRE. Twenty individuals with aMCI and thirty healthy older controls encoded short narratives under self-reference, semantic, and structural conditions. Memory for narrative details was subsequently tested. Results indicated a SRE for narrative information in both aMCI and healthy control groups on a recognition memory test. The SRRE was found in healthy controls and individuals with aMCI. Material valence did not impact the SRE in either group. The SRE appears to be powerful enough to circumvent loss of hippocampal function in aMCI, possibly due to the multimodal nature of narrative information. Findings from this study highlight the potential of the SRE as an effective intervention tool for improving memory for narrative information in aMCI.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Garlic exerts an anti-osteoporotic effect and its vital component allicin could protect organisms against aging. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of long-term intragastric administration of allicin (low-dose of 4 mg·kg-1·d-1; middle-dose of 8 mg·kg-1·d-1; high-dose of 16 mg·kg-1·d-1) on frailty with osteoporosis in aging male Fischer 344 rats. Frailty was assessed with a 27-item frailty index (FI) based on quantifying health-related deficits in adult male rats varied from 13 to 21 months, and in control rats from 6 months to 9 months. Osteoporosis was appraised by bone mineral density (BMD) detected by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), biomechanical properties measured by a three-point bending test and bone metabolic analysis using ELISA. Allicin could attenuate FI scores by reducing accumulation of health deficits in aging male Fischer 344 rats. Meanwhile, allicin could protect against senile osteoporosis, and the underlying mechanism may involve in increasing low bone turnover through elevation of both bone formation and bone resorption, and subsequently lead to increase of BMD, contributing to reversing deleterious bone biomechanical features associated with aging. The present study reveals firstly that long-term oral administration with allicin attenuated frailty with osteoporosis during the process of aging which provides a preclinical evidence for intervention of frailty.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Androgens function by binding to the androgen receptor (AR). Both androgen and RNA-binding protein PSF play a role in the pathology of AD. However, the involvement of AR and PSF in APP regulation in neuron has not been investigated. Here, we explored the regulatory mechanism of APP expression by AR and PSF using neuron-derived cells. We demonstrated that androgen up-regulates the production of APP at the mRNA and protein levels. This induction is enhanced by AR over-expression and inhibited by its silencing. One candidate AR-binding region was identified in the intron region of APP and validated its activity as AR-dependent enhancer by the luciferase assay. Furthermore, the public transcriptome data of brain tissues of mice indicated that APP is regulated by PSF post-transcriptionally. We observed a decreased expression of APP after PSF knockdown and interaction of PSF with the APP transcript. Moreover, we revealed that silencing of PSF inhibited the stability of the APP mRNA. Thus, these results presented a new regulatory mechanism of APP expression by androgen through AR-mediated transcription and PSF at the post-transcriptional level that might be associated with the occurrence of AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this article, we draw on findings from a focus group study with members of a national consortium of translational genomic research sites. The goals were to catalog informal participant engagement practices, to explore the perceived roots of these practices and the motivations of research staff members for adopting them, and to reflect on their ethical implications. We learned that participant engagement is a deliberate strategy by research staff members both to achieve instrumental research goals and to 'do research differently' in response to past research injustices. While many of the participant engagement practices used in translational genomic research are not new, important insights can be gained through a closer examination of the specific contours of participant engagement in this context. These practices appear to have been shaped by the professional training of genetic counselors and by the interests and needs of participants who enroll in clinical genomics studies. The contours of this contemporary application of engaged research principles have relevance not only to clinical genomics research but also to translational research broadly, particularly for how communities of clinical researchers are interpreting the principle of respect for persons. Our findings invite normative questions about the governance of these practices and sociological questions about whether and how clinical researchers in other professions are also engaging participants in translational research settings.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by The Hastings Center.

Previous studies estimated that approximately one-third of the RA population experience bone loss. Moreover, RA patients suffer from a doubled fracture incidence depending on several clinical factors, such as disease severity, age, glucocorticoid (GC) use, and immobility. As OP fractures are related to impaired quality of life and increased mortality rates, OP has an enormous impact on global health status. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a holistic approach in daily clinical practice. In other words, both OP- and RA-related factors should be taken into account in treatment guidelines for OP in RA. First, to determine the actual fracture risk, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), including vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) and calculation of the 10-year fracture risk with FRAX<sup>®</sup>, should be performed. In case of high fracture risk, calcium and vitamin D should be supplemented alongside anti-osteoporotic treatment. Importantly, RA treatment should be optimal, aiming at low disease activity or remission. Moreover, GC treatment should be at the lowest possible dose. In this way, good fracture risk management will lead to fracture risk reduction in RA patients. This review provides a practical guide for clinicians regarding pharmacological treatment options in RA patients with OP, taking into account both osteoporotic-related factors and factors related to RA.</AbstractText>"}

The neurotoxic effects of Pb have been well documented but its effects on the heart are poorly elucidated. We examined the late life cardiac impairments resulting from developmental exposure to Pb. Further, we investigated the protective effect of the nutrient metal mixture containing calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) against Pb-induced long-term effects on cardiac functions.Male albino rats were lactationally exposed to 0.2% Pb-acetate or 0.2% Pb-acetate together nutrient metal mixture as 0.02% in drinking water of the mother from PND 1 to PND 21. The results showed increased levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity at postnatal day (PND) 28 [young], 4 months [adult] and 18 months [old] age group rats. Most notably, exposure to Pb decreased the activities of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), aconitase (Acon), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), xanthine oxidase (XO) and total antioxidant status while the MDA levels increased in all selected age groups of rats. The histological findings showed an age-dependent response to Pb exposure evidenced by extensive degeneration and necrosis in cardiac muscle, disruption in muscle connectivity, hemorrhage, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Co-administration of nutrient metal mixture reversed the Pb-induced cardiac impairments as reflected in the recovery of the chosen sensitive markers of oxidative stress, reduced Pb levels and cardiac tissue changes. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that early-life exposure to Pb continuously influence the cardiac mitochondrial functions from early life to older age and further suggesting that adequate intake of nutrient metals may be potential therapeutic treatment for Pb intoxication.</AbstractText>"}

Indeed, a complex and interactive genetic and environmental system can determine an individual's BP salt sensitivity. However, the genetic/epigenetic determinants leading to salt sensitivity of BP are still challenging to identify primarily because lifestyle-related diseases, including hypertension, usually become a medical problem during adulthood, although their causes may be attributed to the earlier stages of ontogeny. The association between distinct developmental periods involves changes in gene expression, which include epigenetic phenomena. The role of epigenetic modification in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension is presently under investigation.

Here, we examined whether a domain of social context-social dominance-accounted for more phenotypic variation in mice than cage-identity. First, we determined that cages of mice could be categorized into one of three dominance hierarchies with varying degrees of dominance behavior between cage-mates, and low levels of agonistic behavior in the home-cage. Most groups formed dynamic hierarchies with unclear ranks, contrasting with recent accounts of stable transitive hierarchies in groups of mice. Next, we measured some phenotypic traits, and found that social dominance (i.e. dominance hierarchy type and degree of dominance behavior) consistently accounted for some phenotypic variation in all outcome measures, while cage-identity accounted for phenotypic variation in some measures but virtually no variation in others. These findings highlight the importance of considering biologically relevant factors, such as social dominance, in experimental designs and statistical plans.</AbstractText>"}

Tau pathology is frequently found within the MTL of older adults and therefore likely to affect mnemonic discrimination, even in healthy older individuals. The MTL subregions that are known to be affected early by tau pathology, the perirhinal-transentorhinal region (area 35) and the anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (alEC), have recently been implicated in the mnemonic discrimination of objects rather than scenes. Here we used an object-scene mnemonic discrimination task in combination with fMRI recordings and analyzed the relationship between subregional MTL activity, memory performance, and levels of total and phosphorylated tau as well as Aβ42/40 ratio in CSF. We show that activity in alEC was associated with mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes in male and female cognitively unimpaired older adults. Importantly, CSF tau levels were associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, and both increased hippocampal activity as well as tau levels were associated with mnemonic discrimination of objects, but again not scenes. This suggests that dysfunction of the alEC-hippocampus object mnemonic discrimination network might be a marker for tau-related cognitive decline.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subregions in the human medial temporal lobe are critically involved in episodic memory and, at the same time, affected by tau pathology. Impaired object mnemonic discrimination performance as well as aberrant activity within the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry have been reported in earlier studies involving older individuals, but it has thus far remained elusive whether and how tau pathology is implicated in this specific impairment. Using task-related fMRI in combination with measures of tau pathology in CSF, we show that measures of tau pathology are associated with increased hippocampal activity and reduced mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes. This suggests that object mnemonic discrimination tasks could be promising markers for tau-related cognitive decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

At this time, little is known regarding the regulation of the development of the two compartments. <i>Nr4a1</i>, primarily described as a nuclear receptor/immediate early gene involved in the homeostasis of the dopaminergic system, is a striosomal marker. Using <i>Nr4a1</i>-overexpressing and <i>Nr4a1</i>-null mice, we sought to determine whether Nr4a1 is necessary and/or sufficient for striosome development. We report that <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, <i>Nr4a1</i> and <i>Oprm1</i> mRNA levels are correlated. In the absence of Nr4a, there is a decrease in the percentage of striatal surface area occupied by striosomes. Alterations in <i>Nr4a1</i> expression leads to dysregulation of multiple mRNAs of members of the dopamine receptor D<sub>1</sub> signal transduction system. Constitutive overexpression of <i>Nr4a1</i> decreases both the induction of phosphorylation of ERK after a single cocaine exposure and locomotor sensitization following chronic cocaine exposure. <i>Nr4a1</i> overexpression increases MSN excitability but reduces MSN long-term potentiation. In the resting state, type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) activity is normal, but the ability of AC5 to be activated by Drd1 G-protein-coupled receptor inputs is decreased. Our results support a role for <i>Nr4a1</i> in determination of striatal patch/matrix structure and in regulation of dopaminoceptive neuronal function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Cirnaru et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

An enhanced TRPC3 activity is related to adverse effects, including pathological hypertrophy in chronic cardiac disease states. In the present study, we identified FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52, also known as FKBP4) as a novel interaction partner of TRPC3 in the heart. FKBP52 was recovered from a cardiac cDNA library by a C-terminal TRPC3 fragment (amino acids 742-848) in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Downregulation of FKBP52 promoted a TRPC3-dependent hypertrophic response in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs). A similar effect was achieved by overexpressing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase)-deficient FKBP52 mutants. Mechanistically, expression of the FKBP52 truncation mutants elevated TRPC3-mediated currents and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, and the activation of calcineurin and the nuclear factor of activated T-cells in NRCs. Our data demonstrate that FKBP52 associates with TRPC3 via an as-yet-undescribed binding site in the C-terminus of TRPC3 and modulates TRPC3-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in a PPIase-dependent manner. This functional interaction might be crucial for limiting TRPC3-dependent signaling during chronic hypertrophic stimulation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

Phagocytosis activity and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorter. As results of the cytokine array and nCounter gene array, GSH not only up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-α, but also overexpressed neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Furthermore, GSH significantly stimulated the production of immune mediators, including nitric oxide and PGE<sub>2</sub>, as well as phagocytosis activity through nuclear factor kappa B activation.

However, the conclusions of existing studies are inconsistent and even contradictory, making it difficult to form constructive policies with practical value. To explore the reasons for the inconsistent conclusions drawn by relevant research, in this paper we constructed a meta-regression database based on 65 pieces of relevant literature published in the past 25 years. For more valid samples to reduce publication bias, we also set the statistical significance of social support to the health of the elderly in rural areas as a dependent variable. Finally, combined with multi-dimensional social support and its implications for the health of the elderly, meta-regression analysis was carried out on the results of 171 empirical studies. The results show that (1) subjective support rather than objective support can have a significant impact on the health of the elderly in rural areas, and there is no significant difference between other dimensions of social support and objective support; (2) the health status of the elderly in rural areas in samples involving western regions is more sensitive to social support than that in samples not involving the western regions; (3) among the elderly in rural areas, social support for the older male elderly is more likely to improve their health than that for the younger female elderly; and (4) besides this, both data sources and econometric models greatly affect the heterogeneity of the effect of social support on the health of the elderly in rural areas, but neither the published year nor the journal is significant.

It is well established that the presence of AF increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, sudden death, and cardiovascular morbidity. In the last two decades several reports have shown an association between AF and cognitive function, ranging from impairment to dementia. Ischemic stroke linked to AF is a well-known risk factor and predictor of cognitive decline. In this clinical scenario, the risk of stroke might be reduced by oral anticoagulation. However, recent data suggest that AF may be a predictor of cognitive impairment and dementia also in the absence of stroke. Cerebral hypoperfusion, reduced brain volume, microbleeds, white matter hyperintensity, neuroinflammation, and genetic factors have been considered as potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AF-related cognitive dysfunction. However, a cause-effect relationship remains still controversial. Consequently, no therapeutic strategies are available to prevent AF-related cognitive decline in stroke-free patients. This review will analyze the potential mechanisms leading to cognitive dysfunction in AF patients and examine the available data on the impact of a sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance strategy in reducing the risk of cognitive decline.</AbstractText>"}

Eighty adult male rats were randomly divided into four groups: Saline Control (group C), DGA (group A), Swimming exercise before DGA (group S1), and Swimming during DGA (group S2). These four groups of animals were further divided into Morris water maze training group (M subgroup) and sedentary control group (N subgroup). Spatial learning/memory was tested using Morris water maze training. The number and density of synaptophysin (Syp) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in hippocampal dentate gyrus area, CREB mRNA and protein expression and DNA methylation levels were determined respectively with immunohistochemistry, western blot, real-time PCR, and MassArray methylation detection platform. We found that compared with group C, DGA rats showed aging-like poor health and weight loss as well as hippocampal neurodegenerative characteristics. Exercise training led to a time-dependent decrease in average escape latency and improved spatial memory. Exercise training group (S2M) had significantly increased swim distance as compared with controls.

Collectively, these observations mechanistically link the cellular redox state to the inactivation of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> through the formation of amyloid fibrils.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

BSM was synthesized through a reaction between branched amino silicone and isocyanatoethyl methacrylate, and it was incorporated into 2,2-bis [4- (2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxy-propoxy)phenyl] propane (Bis-GMA)/triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) (50 wt/50 wt) with a series of concentrations to form resin matrices. The experimental composites (EC) were then prepared by mixing different resin matrices with silaned BaAlSiO<sub>2</sub> fillers. The double bond conversion, volumetric shrinkage, and mechanical properties of the prepared experimental resin composites were measured among groups with different BSM concentrations. A bacterial adhesion assay for bacteria colony counting was conducted using Streptococcus mutans. The results showed that all of the experimental resin composites had nearly the same double bond conversion ranging from 60.9 ± 0.3% to 62.4 ± 1.3% (p &gt; 0.05). BSM could reduce the volumetric shrinkage of experimental resin composites, and composites with 20 wt% and 30 wt% of BSM in the resin matrix had the lowest volumetric shrinkage (p &lt; 0.05). The flexural strength would be impaired after adding 30 wt% of BSM into the resin matrix of experimental resin composites, and BSM had no negative influence on the flexural modulus in this study. The water contact angles on the surfaces of BSM-containing composites were all higher than that on the surface of control group (p &lt; 0.05), and followed a trend of increasing with the increase of the BSM concentration. S. mutans adherence on the surfaces of the EC-10%, EC-15%, EC-20% and EC-30% groups were significantly lower compared with the control group. This work suggested that the hydrophobic resin composites incorporating of BSM could reduce S. mutans adhesion and possibly increase the longevity of resin composite restorations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal, morphological and mechanical properties of silicone/silica composite samples were studied before and after aging, flexural tests and immersion in saline environment. Understanding the effect of silica content, aging conditions and thickness (from 0.6 to 2 mm) of the samples on the behavior of these materials in different environments is crucial for applications as implantable devices. Before inducing any mechanical stress, tensile strength was found to increase for samples containing 3 or 5 wt% of fumed silica, depending on the thickness. A similar trend was observed after 10<sup>6</sup> flexes for tensile strength, storage modulus and hardness at room temperature, which increased with the concentration of fumed silica. Moreover, tensile strength decreased with increasing the thickness of the samples from 0.6 to 2 mm. The thermal degradation was found to start at higher temperature in the case of the composites as compared with neat silicone, however, the glass transition and melting temperatures were only slightly modified by the presence of the silica particles, regardless the mechanical aging. The MTT assay using L929 fibroblasts mouse cells showed a good short-time cytocompatibility for both silicone elastomer and the composite with 3 wt% fumed silica.

Insulin-evoked insulin receptor (IR) activation increases activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRβ on tyrosine residues 960, 1150, and 1151, insulin receptor substrate-1 recruitment to IRβ and phosphorylated RAC-α-serine/threonine-protein kinase.

Adiponectin activates adiponectin receptors to induce APPL1 binding to adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 and T-cadherin and downstream adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Insulin inhibited adiponectin-induced signaling. In addition, leptin-induced leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling promotes Janus kinase 2 recruitment to OB-R and Janus kinase 2 and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation.

Education may influence cognitive functioning through mechanisms involving brain maintenance (BM: reduced age-related pathology) or cognitive reserve (CR: altered pathology-cognition association). We examined evidence for each mechanism by quantifying main and interaction effects of education within a well-studied pathway involving systolic blood pressure, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and episodic memory in 2 samples without dementia at the baseline (total N = 1136). There were no effects of education on systolic blood pressure or WMH, suggesting a lack of evidence for BM. In the sample less likely to progress to dementia, education attenuated the effect of WMH on memory at the baseline. In the sample more likely to progress to dementia, education exacerbated this effect at the baseline.

We assessed whether arteriolar hyalinosis is caused by Klotho deficiency, a state known to induce both renal and vascular phenotypes associated with aging. Histochemistry was used to assess hyalinosis in Klotho<sup>-/-</sup> kidneys, compared with Klotho<sup>+/-</sup> and wild-type littermates. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate vascular lesion composition and the different layers of the vascular wall. Finally, spironolactone was used to inhibit calcification in kl/kl mice, and vascular lesions were characterized in the kidney. Arteriolar hyalinosis was detected in Klotho<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which was present up to the afferent arterioles. Hyalinosis was accompanied by loss of α-smooth muscle actin expression, whereas the endothelial lining was mostly intact. Hyalinous lesions were positive for IgM and iC3b/c/d, indicating subendothelial leakage of plasma proteins. The presence of extracellular matrix proteins suggested increased production by smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Finally, in Klotho<sup>-/-</sup> mice with marked vascular calcification, treatment with spironolactone allowed for replacement of calcification by hyalinosis. Klotho deficiency potentiates both endothelial hyperpermeability and SMC dedifferentiation. In the absence of a calcification-inducing stimulus, SMCs assume a synthetic phenotype in response to subendothelial leakage of plasma proteins. In the kidney, this results in arteriolar hyalinosis, which contributes to the decline in renal function. Klotho may play a role in preventing aging-related arteriolar hyalinosis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

MGO is mainly formed as a byproduct of glycolysis and, under physiological circumstances, detoxified by the glyoxalase system. MGO is the major precursor of nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and DNA, subsequently leading to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). MGO and MGO-derived AGEs can impact on organs and tissues affecting their functions and structure. In this review we summarize the formation of MGO, the detoxification of MGO by the glyoxalase system, and the biochemical pathways through which MGO is linked to the development of diabetes, vascular complications of diabetes, and other age-related diseases. Although interventions to treat MGO-associated complications are not yet available in the clinical setting, several strategies to lower MGO have been developed over the years. We will summarize several new directions to target MGO stress including glyoxalase inducers and MGO scavengers. Targeting MGO burden may provide new therapeutic applications to mitigate diseases in which MGO plays a crucial role.</AbstractText>"}

We systematically selected five functional SNPs (rs2602120, rs3017895, rs9224, rs7657817, and rs3756050) and genotyped them with the Genesky proprietary improved Multiligase Detection Reaction multiplex SNP genotyping system in a case-control study of 626 lung cancer cases and 667 cancer-free controls. The functional effects of <i>FAM13A</i> and specific miRNAs (miRNA-22-5p and miRNA-1301-3p) were evaluated based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We found that rs9224 in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of <i>FAM13A</i> was potentially associated with an increased risk of lung squamous carcinoma (LUSQ) (additive model: odds ratio = 1.47, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-2.07, <i>p</i> = 0.028).

Heart and circulatory physiology","Date":"Nov 01 2019","Keywords":"1-D simulations, hemodynamic monitoring, noninvasive","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Mathematical models of the arterial tree constitute a valuable tool to investigate the hemodynamics of aging and pathology. Rendering such models as patient specific could allow for the assessment of central hemodynamic variables of clinical interest. However, this task is challenging, particularly with respect to the tuning of the local area compliance that varies significantly along the arterial tree. Accordingly, in this study, we demonstrate the importance of taking into account the differential effects of aging on the stiffness of central and peripheral arteries when simulating a person's hemodynamic profile. More specifically, we propose a simple method for effectively adapting the properties of a generic one-dimensional model of the arterial tree based on the subject's age and noninvasive measurements of aortic flow and brachial pressure. A key element for the success of the method is the implementation of different mechanisms of arterial stiffening for young and old individuals. The designed methodology was tested and validated against in vivo data from a population of <i>n</i> = 20 adults. Carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity was accurately predicted by the model (mean error = 0.14 m/s, SD = 0.77 m/s), with the greatest deviations being observed for older subjects. In regard to aortic pressure, model-derived systolic blood pressure and augmentation index were both in good agreement (mean difference of 2.3 mmHg and 4.25%, respectively) with the predictions of a widely used commercial device (Mobil-O-Graph). These preliminary results encourage us to further validate the method in larger samples and consider its potential as a noninvasive tool for hemodynamic monitoring.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> We propose a technique for adapting the parameters of a validated one-dimensional model of the arterial tree using noninvasive measurements of aortic flow and brachial pressure. Emphasis is given on the adjustment of the arterial tree distensibility, which incorporates the nonuniform effects of aging on central and peripheral vessel elasticity.

Conversely, phase II clinical trials reported no significant effects on motor improvement vs placebo. The disease duration and the quantity, infusion approach, and duration of GDNF delivery may affect GDNF efficacy in PD treatment. However, identifying mechanisms activated by GDNF that affect nigrostriatal function may reveal additional avenues to partially restore nigrostriatal function. In PD and aging models, GDNF affects tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression or phosphorylation in substantia nigra (SN), long after a single GDNF injection in striatum. In aged rats, the GDNF family receptor, GFR-α1, increases TH expression and phosphorylation in SN. To determine if GFR-α1 could be a mechanistic link in long-term GDNF impact, we conducted two studies; first to determine if a single unilateral striatal delivery of GDNF affected GFR-α1 and TH over time (1 day, 1 week, and 4 weeks) in the striatum or SN in aged rats, and second, to determine if soluble GFR-α1 could mitigate TH loss following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. In aged rats, GDNF bilaterally increased ser31 TH phosphorylation and GFR-α1 expression in SN at 1 day and 4 weeks after GDNF, respectively. In striatum, GFR-α1 expression decreased 1 week after GDNF, only on the GDNF-injected side. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, recombinant soluble GFR-α1 mitigated nigral, but not striatal, TH protein loss following 6-OHDA. Together, these results show GDNF has immediate and long-term impact on dopamine regulation in the SN, which includes a gradual increase in GFR-α1 expression that may sustain TH expression and dopamine function therein.</AbstractText>"}

To help bridge this gap and improve patient outcomes, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research assembled a multistakeholder coalition to develop clinical recommendations for the optimal prevention of secondary fracture among people aged 65 years and older with a hip or vertebral fracture. The coalition developed 13 recommendations (7 primary and 6 secondary) strongly supported by the empirical literature. The coalition recommends increased communication with patients regarding fracture risk, mortality and morbidity outcomes, and fracture risk reduction. Risk assessment (including fall history) should occur at regular intervals with referral to physical and/or occupational therapy as appropriate. Oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous pharmacotherapies are efficacious and can reduce risk of future fracture. Patients need education, however, about the benefits and risks of both treatment and not receiving treatment. Oral bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate are first-line options and are generally well tolerated; otherwise, intravenous zoledronic acid and subcutaneous denosumab can be considered. Anabolic agents are expensive but may be beneficial for selected patients at high risk. Optimal duration of pharmacotherapy is unknown but because the risk for second fractures is highest in the early post-fracture period, prompt treatment is recommended. Adequate dietary or supplemental vitamin D and calcium intake should be assured. Individuals being treated for osteoporosis should be reevaluated for fracture risk routinely, including via patient education about osteoporosis and fractures and monitoring for adverse treatment effects. Patients should be strongly encouraged to avoid tobacco, consume alcohol in moderation at most, and engage in regular exercise and fall prevention strategies. Finally, referral to endocrinologists or other osteoporosis specialists may be warranted for individuals who experience repeated fracture or bone loss and those with complicating comorbidities (eg, hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease). © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Early intervention/treatment relies on early diagnosis of PD. There is increasing interest in methods based on electromyography measurements of PD patients because of its noninvasiveness. Thus, this study was to investigate electromyographic (EMG) characteristics of the upper limb between PD patients and healthy control subjects using EMG, and to distinguish PD patients from healthy control subjects according to the EMG information using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Sixteen right-handed PD patients and 25 right-handed healthy subjects participated in experiments involving elbow flexion movement. The frequency power, duration, skewness, recurrence rate, and correlation dimension of EMG signals and success rate for the right hand and the skewness of EMG signals for the left hand were found to be significantly different between the two groups. This information was subsequently used to distinguish PD patients from healthy control subjects using the SVM classifier to obtain a mean accuracy of 87.02%. Although the results may not be immediately available to use in clinical applications, the safety, simplicity and speed of the system still merits further consideration. Enhancing performance accuracy and examining PD patients in different stages of disease are anticipated in future investigations.</AbstractText>"}

While some tissue samples can be obtained from a living patient, the procurement of a whole brain requires the donation from people after their death. In order to promote positive attitudes towards brain donation, it is essential to understand why people do or do not donate their brain to medical research. In 2018 we undertook a systematic review of the international literature concerning people's attitudes, motivations, and feelings about brain donation. Five electronic databases were searched: Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar. Search terms included: ('brain donor*' OR 'brain donation' OR 'brain banking' OR 'banking on brain') AND (attitude* OR motivation* OR decision*') AND (LIMIT-TO 'human') AND (LIMIT-TO (LANGUAGE, 'English')). Articles were analysed using the Framework for Assessing Qualitative Evaluations and a meta-ethnographic approach. Fourteen articles were included for review. The findings suggest four universal factors informing a person's decision to donate their brain: (1) contextual knowledge, (2) conceptual understandings, (3) family/friends matter, and (4) personal experience, time and process. The findings also indicate that the way healthcare professionals present themselves can influence people's feelings and attitudes towards brain donation. Healthcare and research professionals who are involved in brain donation processes must be mindful of the complex and multiple factors that influence donation outcomes.

Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and structural equation modeling (SEM), latent hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine associations of (i) loneliness, (ii) a range of covariates, and (iii) loneliness by covariate interactions with latent brain volume estimates of brain structures known to be involved in processing, expressing, and regulating emotions. Results from whole-brain VBM analyses showed that individuals with higher loneliness scores tended to have smaller gray matter volumes in three clusters comprising (i) the left amygdala/anterior hippocampus, (ii) the left posterior parahippocampus and (iii) the left cerebellum. Significant associations and interactions between loneliness and latent factors for the amygdala and the hippocampus were confirmed with a region-of-interest (ROI)-based approach. These findings suggest that individual differences in loneliness among older adults are correlated with individual differences in the volumes of brain regions that are central to cognitive processing and emotional regulation, also after correcting for confounders such as social network size.

A new technique has been developed which enables the investigation of radiation damage of samples subject to a thermal gradient, whereby a wealth of data over a range of irradiation temperatures is produced from a single irradiation experiment. The results produced are practically inaccessible by use of multiple conventional isothermal irradiations. We present a precipitation-hardened copper alloy (CuCrZr) case-study irradiated with a linear temperature gradient between 125 and 440 °C. Subsequent micro-scale post irradiation characterisation (nanoindentation, transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography) highlight the capability to observe mechanical and microstructural changes over a wide range of irradiation temperatures. We observed irradiation-softening in CuCrZr that did not occur due to irradiation-enhanced aging of the Cr-precipitates. Excellent reproducibility of the new technique was demonstrated and replicated irradiation-hardening data from several isothermal neutron irradiation studies.

Among viral delivery systems, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are relatively safe and demonstrate high gene transfer efficiency, low immunogenicity, stable long-term expression, and selective tissue tropism. Combined with modern gene technologies, such as cell-specific promoters, the Cre/lox system, and genome editing, AAVs represent a practical, rapid, and economical alternative to conditional knockout and transgenic mouse models. However, major obstacles remain for widespread AAV utilization, such as impractical purification strategies and low viral quantities. Here, we report an improved protocol to produce serotype-independent purified AAVs economically. Using a helper-free AAV system, we purified AAVs from HEK293T cell lysates and medium by polyethylene glycol precipitation with subsequent aqueous two-phase partitioning. Furthermore, we then implemented an iodixanol gradient purification, which resulted in preparations with purities adequate for in vivo use. Of note, we achieved titers of 10<sup>10</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> viral genome copies per µl with a typical production volume of up to 1 ml while requiring five times less than the usual number of HEK293T cells used in standard protocols. For proof of concept, we verified in vivo transduction via Western blot, qPCR, luminescence, and immunohistochemistry. AAVs coding for glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) shRNA successfully inhibited Glrx expression by ~66% in the liver and skeletal muscle.

Structural changes of the biochar after aging treatment and the treatment's effect on Pb(II) absorption were explored. The results showed that oxygen-containing functional groups, aromatic structure and surface area of the biochar increased after the aging treatment. However, the integrity of the tubular structure was broken into fragments. The adsorption process of Pb(II) was in accordance with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and fitted by the Langmuir model. With the increase of pH, the adsorption capacities of Pb(II) increased gradually, and the adsorption effect was best at pH 5. The aged HB presented a decrease of the carboxyl group, which caused less adsorption capacity of Pb(II) than that of aged LB. The maximum adsorption capacities of Pb(II) on fresh biochar at 350 °C and 650 °C were 279.85 and 286.07 mg·g<sup>-1</sup> and on aged biochar were 242.57 and 159.82 mg·g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The adsorption capacity of HB for Pb(II) was higher than that of LB, and the adsorption capacity of aged biochar for Pb(II) decreased obviously, which might be attributable to changes in physicochemical properties of biochar after the aging treatment.</AbstractText>"}

To address such challenges, a time series analysis model (i.e., the autoregressive integrated moving average, ARIMA) and an artificial neural network model (i.e., the multilayer perceptron neural network, MLPNN) were developed for predicting wastewater inflow. A case study of the Barrie Wastewater Treatment Facility in Barrie, Canada, was carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models. Fifteen-minute flow data over a period of 1 year were collected, and the resampled daily flow data were used to train and validate the developed models. The model performances were examined using root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. The results indicate that both models provided reliable forecasts, while ARIMA showed a slightly better performance than MLPNN in this case study.

In addition to this approval for the treatment system, at least 90% of outlet concentrations have to be below 30 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for total suspended solids (TSS) and 35 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for biochemical oxygen demand. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effluent quality of these treatment systems on site, i.e. under real operating conditions, and to assess their performances. Between 2011 and 2016, 1,286 treated wastewater samples were taken from 231 on-site sanitation facilities in France. Data collected are heterogeneous and a robust statistical methodology (using a generalized log-linear model) was used to study the effects of four explanatory variables (treatment systems, loading rate, aging and sampling methods) on the distribution of treated wastewater concentrations. The model calculates median outlet concentrations depending on the effects identified. Its application allowed studying and comparing the outlet median concentrations of 21 on-site sanitation systems classified into nine categories and three groups. Four treatment systems out of the 21 monitored showed TSS median outlet concentrations below 10 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and four treatment systems have TSS medians higher than the regulatory threshold of 30 mg L<sup>-1</sup>.</AbstractText>"}

How hematopoietic kindlin-3 contributes to the assembly and stability of the adhesion complex is not known. Here we report that kindlin-3 recruits leupaxin into podosomes and thereby regulates paxillin phosphorylation and podosome turnover. We demonstrate that the activity of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST, which controls paxillin phosphorylation, requires leupaxin. In contrast, despite sharing the same binding mode with leupaxin, paxillin recruitment into podosomes is kindlin-3 independent. Instead, we found paxillin together with talin and vinculin in initial adhesion patches of kindlin-3-null cells. Surprisingly, despite its presence in these early adhesion patches, podosomes can form in the absence of paxillin or any paxillin member. In conclusion, our findings show that kindlin-3 not only activates and clusters integrins into podosomes but also regulates their lifetime by recruiting leupaxin, which controls PTP-PEST activity and thereby paxillin phosphorylation and downstream signaling.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Klapproth et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, through bisulfite sequencing and strand-specific mapping, we show mitochondrial genomes in humans and other animals are strongly biased to light (L)-strand non-CpG methylation with conserved peak loci preferentially located at gene-gene boundaries, which was also independently validated by MeDIP and FspEI digestion. Such mtDNA methylation patterns are conserved across different species and developmental stages but display dynamic local or global changes during development and aging. Knockout of <i>DNMT3A</i> alone perturbed mtDNA regional methylation patterns, but not global levels, and altered mitochondrial gene expression, copy number, and oxygen respiration. Overexpression of <i>DNMT3A</i> strongly increased mtDNA methylation and strand bias. Overall, methylation at gene bodies and boundaries was negatively associated with mitochondrial transcript abundance and also polycistronic transcript processing. Furthermore, HPLC-MS confirmed the methylation signals on mitochondria DNA. Together, these data provide high-resolution mtDNA methylation maps that revealed a strand-specific non-CpG methylation, its dynamic regulation, and its impact on the polycistronic mitochondrial transcript processing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Dou et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</CopyrightInformation>"}

To evaluate a possible unique founder effect of P301L, and its age, the analysis of 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering 50 kb and 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms located along 30 Mb around the mutation was performed by developing 2 multiplex single-base extension reactions. In addition, families with affected and healthy individuals from France and Italy were analyzed. The FTD-affected individuals from Barcelona carried the same 50-kb haplotype linked to P301L mutation, suggesting a unique common ancestor, as opposed to French patients. Italian patients are also probably descendants of a unique ancestor, which would be different from that of Barcelona. Diversity of 30-Mb haplotypes found in Barcelona and the inference of the mutation age in these populations, among other reasons, suggest that prevalence of FTD linked to P301L MAPT mutation is the result of a locally originated mutation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate the damage rate, SOS was assessed after collagenase digestion. SOS scores negatively correlated with aging and MDG scores. Dissected aortas had higher SOS and MDG scores without age correlation. Collagenase digestion was present in all aortas, but older aortas were more injured than younger aortas. Dissected aortas were more vulnerable to collagenase. Older and dissected aortas expressed specific extracellular matrix components to compensate for mechanical weakness.

A notable feature of advanced eusocial insects is the longevity of reproductive individuals (queens and kings) compared to those from non-reproductive castes (workers and soldiers) within a given species, with a proposed link towards upregulation of telomerase activity in the somatic tissues of reproductive individuals. Given this, eusocial insects provide excellent model systems for research into ageing. We tested telomerase activity and measured telomere length in Bombus terrestris, which is a primitively eusocial insect species with several distinct features compared to advanced social insects. In somatic tissues, telomerase activity was upregulated only in the fat bodies of pre-diapause queens, and this upregulation was linked to heightened DNA synthesis. Telomere length was shorter in old queens compared to that in younger queens or workers. We speculate that (1) the upregulation of telomerase activity, together with DNA synthesis, is the essential step for intensifying metabolic activity in the fat body to build up a sufficient energy reserve prior to diapause, and that (2) the lifespan differences between B. terrestris workers and queens are related to the long diapause period of the queen. A possible relationship between telomere length regulation and TOR, FOXO, and InR as cell signaling components, was tested.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a perennial, alfalfa is cut several times each year. Farmers face a dilemma: if cut earlier, forage nutritive value is much higher but regrowth is affected and the longevity of the stand is severely compromised. On the other hand, if alfalfa is cut later at full flower, stands persist longer and more biomass may be harvested, but the nutritive value diminishes. Alfalfa is a strict long-day plant. We reasoned that by manipulating the response to photoperiod, we could delay flowering to improve forage quality and widen each harvesting window, facilitating management. With this aim, we functionally characterized the FLOWERING LOCUS T family of genes, represented by five members: MsFTa1, MsFTa2, MsFTb1, MsFTb2 and MsFTc. The expression of MsFTa1 correlated with photoperiodic flowering and its down-regulation led to severe delayed flowering. Altogether, with late flowering, low expression of MsFTa1 led to changes in plant architecture resulting in increased leaf to stem biomass ratios and forage digestibility. By manipulating photoperiodic flowering, we were able to improve the quality of alfalfa forage and management, which may allow farmers to cut alfalfa of high nutritive value without compromising stand persistence.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

TSPO modulation also appears to play a role in other mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial respiration and cell survival. In the central nervous system, its expression is up-regulated in neuropathology such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that two new TSPO ligands, named 2a and 2b, stimulated pregnenolone synthesis and ATP production in a cellular model of AD overproducing β-amyloid peptide. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of the new TSPO ligands on mitochondrial dysfunction in a cellular model of AD-related tauopathy (human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y stably overexpressing the P301L-mutant Tau) presenting mitochondrial impairments, including a decreased ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as a decrease in pregnenolone synthesis compared to control cells. The effects of our new ligands were compared with those of TSPO ligands described in the literature (XBD173, SSR-180,575 and Ro5-4864). The TSPO ligands 2a and 2b exerted beneficial mitochondrial modulatory effects by increasing ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential, paralleled by an increase of pregnenolone levels in mutant Tau cells, as well as in control cells. The compounds 2a and 2b showed effects on mitochondrial activity similar to those obtained with the TSPO ligands of reference. These findings indicate that the new TSPO ligands modulate the mitochondrial bioenergetic phenotype as well as the de novo synthesis of neurosteroids in a cellular model of AD-related tauopathy, suggesting that these compounds could be potential new therapeutic tools for the treatment of AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The reaction variants studied included type of oxidant, dopamine (DA) concentration, pH, adhesion time prior to spin, substrate chemistry, and notably, DA solution aging time. A strong oxidant, sodium periodate (SP), and a weak oxidant, atmospheric oxygen were chosen. It was found that reactions in solution were much faster and produced much thicker PDA films with SP than with oxygen. PDA thickness correlated positively with DA concentration, SP solution pH, and adhesion time. DA oxidation and aggregation is a dynamic process, which is reflected in the DA aging-time parameter. PDA film thickness reached a maximum value as DA solution aged. Color photography, UV-vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering indicated that the optimal DA aging time for PDA adhesion is the result of the evolution of PDA particle size and chemistry over time. The capture of the optimal aging-time window was identified as the critical parameter for preparing PDA films with continuity and appreciable thickness. When these conditions were applied in a modified dip-coating method, comparable PDA films were fabricated as those obtained from spin-coating. Native silicon wafers (SiO<sub>2</sub>) as well as wafers that were modified with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and amine-containing polydimethylsiloxane (PADMS) were chosen to represent a wide range of substrates with different substrate-PDA interactions. The main effect of substrate structural difference was on PDA film morphology. 'Island' morphologies were obtained on PDMS where only hydrophobic interactions are responsible for PDA adhesion, while 'speck' morphologies were observed on SiO<sub>2</sub> and PADMS. The stabilities of the fabricated PDA films were tested in 0.1 M HCl and DMSO. The SP-derived PDA films exhibited very little mass loss compared to those fabricated using either the conventional dip-coating method or oxygen as an oxidant. Choosing a strong oxidant, understanding the DA reaction dynamics, and taking advantage of the optimal DA aging time are important in the fabrication of stable PDA films on a variety of substrates.</AbstractText>"}

We find that sKL induces the expression of EGR-1 mRNA and protein. Through mutational analysis, we identify the 130 bp region on the EGR-1 promoter that is responsive to sKL overexpression. Additionally, sKL induces the expression of markers of bone differentiation (BMP2, RUNX2, ALP, COL1A, and osteocalcin) in osteoblast MC3T3 cells. EGR-1 siRNA decreases the bone mineralization induced by sKL or ascorbic acid/glycerol 2-phosphate in MC3T3 cells.

Due to the variable availability and high cost of the bovine liver powder (BLP) constituent of many current larval diets, there is an urgent demand for new ingredients in order to support sustainable and efficient mosquito production while reducing rearing cost, without affecting the quality of the insects produced. Two black soldier fly (BSF) powder-based diet formulations (50% tuna meal, 35% BSF powder, 15% brewer's yeast and 50% tuna meal + 50% BSF powder) were tested for their suitability to support the development of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in mass-rearing conditions. Overall, the results indicate that the use of the BSF powder did not negatively impact the development and quality of the produced insects in terms of time to pupation, adult production and male flight ability. Furthermore, depending on the species and diet formulations, there were improvements in some parameters such as female body size, egg production, egg hatch rate and male longevity. BSF powder is a valuable ingredient that can effectively replace costly BLP for the mass production of high quality Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Both diet formulations can be used for Ae. aegypti showing high plasticity to nutrition sources. However, for Ae. albopictus we recommend the combination including brewer's yeast.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© W. Mamai et al., published by EDP Sciences, 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, evidence that older adults exhibit greater visual feature-binding deficits than younger adults has been mixed. Binding deficits in older adults are often observed using paradigms with easy-to-label features. Labeling and rehearsing single features may result in apparent binding deficits if older adults rely on comparatively intact verbal memory to compensate for declining visual WM. This strategy would be more useful for single features (e.g., 'red'), than for conjunctions of features (e.g., 'red triangle'), which are more cumbersome to rehearse, and thus visual feature-binding paradigms that do not prevent verbal strategies may unintentionally measure verbal load differences. Across 3 experiments (total N = 150), we investigated the role of verbal rehearsal by manipulating ease of stimulus labeling for visually presented single features and conjunctions of 2 features. Overall, visual memory for difficult-to-label, noncategorical, visual information appeared especially limited for older adults, likely because it impedes engagement of other systems, such as verbal WM or long-term memory. Therefore, comparing younger- and older-adult task performance may not straightforwardly reveal age-related visual WM decline, but instead reflect applications of different strategies that tap different cognitive mechanisms. We discuss implications for the feature-binding literature and the wider visual WM literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

Increasing evidence shows that these antipredator responses may also lead to changes in life-history traits such as aging and lifespan. However, little is known about how predator cues influence the fitness of preys and their transgenerational effects. Parental spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) were either raised on a leaf disc with or without cues from a natural predator (Phytoseiulus persimilis). The results showed that predator cues prolonged the development of both sexes, shortened female adult lifespan but not that of males, and reduced lifetime reproductive outputs of the females. The studies with offspring from both cues-exposed and control mothers demonstrated that parental effects were significant in the early developmental stage of offspring, but not in later life stages. The lifespan of offspring was strongly negatively affected by the predator-induced stress when they were directly exposed but not the stress-experienced by their mothers. Additionally, the parental effects in the earlier life stage were sex-specific, with delayed hatching in daughters (but not sons) when parents were exposed to predator-induced stress. This cross-transgenerational study indicated that there were deleterious effects of predator-induced stress on aging and lifespan of prey for both parents and their offspring, although the parental effects appeared to be weak (in the early stage of offspring but diminished in adult stage). This study highlighted the sex-difference of prey in response to predator-induced stress and sex-dependent parental effects on the offspring.</AbstractText>"}

Recent advances emphasize the genetic heterogeneity of POI. Fanconi anemia (FA) genes, traditionally known for their essential roles in DNA repair and cytogenetic instability, have been demonstrated to be involved in meiosis and germ cell development. Here, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 50 Han Chinese female patients with POI. Rare missense variants were identified in FANCA (Fanconi anemia complementation group A): c.1772G &gt; A (p.R591Q) and c.3887A &gt; G (p.E1296G). Both variants are heterozygous in the patients and very rare in the human population. In vitro functional studies further demonstrated that these two missense variants of FANCA exhibited reduced protein expression levels compared with the wild type, suggesting the partial loss of function. Moreover, mono-ubiquitination levels of FANCD2 upon mitomycin C stimulation were significantly reduced in cells overexpressing FANCA variants. Furthermore, a loss-of-function mutation of Fanca was generated in C57BL/6 mice for in vivo functional assay. Consistently, heterozygous mutated female mice (Fanca<sup>+/-</sup>) showed reduced fertility and declined numbers of follicles with aging when compared with the wild-type female mice. Collectively, our results suggest that heterozygous pathogenic variants in FANCA are implicated in non-syndromic POI in Han Chinese women, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of POI and highlight the contribution of FANCA variants in female subfertility.</AbstractText>"}

Specific neurons of the hypothalamus provide important signals to control food intake and energy expenditure. In individuals with obesity, a microglia-dependent inflammatory response damages the neural circuits responsible for maintaining whole-body energy homeostasis, resulting in a positive energy balance. However, little is known about the role of IL-6 in the regulation of hypothalamic microglia. In this systematic review, we asked what types of conditions and stimuli could modulate microglial IL-6 expression in murine model. We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases and analyzed 13 articles that evaluated diverse contexts and study models focused on IL-6 expression and microglia activation, including the effects of stress, hypoxia, infection, neonatal overfeeding and nicotine exposure, lipopolysaccharide stimulus, hormones, exercise protocols, and aging. The results presented in this review emphasized the role of 'injury-like' stimuli, under which IL-6 acts as a proinflammatory cytokine, concomitant with marked microglial activation, which drive hypothalamic neuroinflammation. Emerging evidence indicates an important correlation of basal IL-6 levels and microglial function with the maintenance of hypothalamic homeostasis. Advances in our understanding of these different contexts will lead to the development of more specific pharmacological approaches for the management of acute and chronic conditions, like obesity and metabolic diseases, without disturbing the homeostatic functions of IL-6 and microglia in the hypothalamus.</AbstractText>"}

In addition to having biomedical implications, insights into microbial ageing shed light on the role of ageing in the origin of life and the upper limits to longevity.</AbstractText>"}

STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.</AbstractText>"}

This is further encumbered  by the small size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A particular advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human neuropathies.</AbstractText>"}

A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule, and mutations in the gene encoding A20 are associated with a wide panel of inflammatory pathologies, both in human and in the mouse. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 triggers the NF-κB-dependent expression of A20 as part of a negative feedback mechanism preventing sustained NF-κB activation. Apart from acting as an NF-κB inhibitor, A20 is also well-known for its ability to counteract the cytotoxic potential of TNF. However, the mechanism by which A20 mediates this function and the exact cell death modality that it represses have remained incompletely understood. In the present study, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidences that deletion of A20 induces RIPK1 kinase-dependent and -independent apoptosis upon single TNF stimulation. We show that constitutively expressed A20 is recruited to TNFR1 signaling complex (Complex I) via its seventh zinc finger (ZF7) domain, in a cIAP1/2-dependent manner, within minutes after TNF sensing. We demonstrate that Complex I-recruited A20 protects cells from apoptosis by stabilizing the linear (M1) ubiquitin network associated to Complex I, a process independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitylase (DUB) activities and which is counteracted by the DUB CYLD, both in vitro and in vivo. In absence of linear ubiquitylation, A20 is still recruited to Complex I via its ZF4 and ZF7 domains, but this time protects the cells from death by deploying its DUB activity. Together, our results therefore demonstrate two distinct molecular mechanisms by which constitutively expressed A20 protect cells from TNF-induced apoptosis.</AbstractText>"}

Cur2004-8 is a synthetic curcumin derivative having symmetrical bis-alkynyl pyridines that shows a strong anti-angiogenic activity. In the present study, we examined the effect of dietary supplementation with Cur2004-8 on response to environmental stresses and aging using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. Dietary intervention with Cur2004-8 significantly increased resistance of C. elegans to oxidative stress. Its anti-oxidative-stress effect was greater than curcumin. However, response of C. elegans to heat stress or ultraviolet irradiation was not significantly affected by Cur2004-8. Next, we examined the effect of Cur2004-8 on aging. Cur2004-8 significantly extended both mean and maximum lifespan, accompanying a shift in time-course distribution of progeny production. Age-related decline in motility was also delayed by supplementation with Cur2004-8. In addition, Cur2004-8 prevented amyloid-beta-induced toxicity in Alzheimer's disease model animals which required a forkhead box (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16. Dietary supplementation with Cur2004-8 also reversed the increase of mortality observed in worms treated with high-glucose-diet. These results suggest that Cur2004-8 has higher anti-oxidant and anti-aging activities than curcumin. It can be used for the development of novel anti-aging product.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we identify a role for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in age-associated impairment of bone fracture healing and osteoblast differentiation, and we investigate the mechanism by which ApoE alters these processes. We identified that, in both humans and mice, circulating ApoE levels increase with age. We assessed bone healing in WT and ApoE-/- mice after performing tibial fracture surgery: bone deposition was higher within fracture calluses from ApoE-/- mice. In vitro recombinant ApoE (rApoE) treatment of differentiating osteoblasts decreased cellular differentiation and matrix mineralization. Moreover, this rApoE treatment decreased osteoblast glycolytic activity while increasing lipid uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Using parabiosis models, we determined that circulating ApoE plays a strong inhibitory role in bone repair. Using an adeno-associated virus-based siRNA system, we decreased circulating ApoE levels in 24-month-old mice and demonstrated that, as a result, fracture calluses from these aged mice displayed enhanced bone deposition and mechanical strength. Our results demonstrate that circulating ApoE as an aging factor inhibits bone fracture healing by altering osteoblast metabolism, thereby identifying ApoE as a new therapeutic target for improving bone repair in the elderly.</AbstractText>"}

This hypothesis proposes that improved cognitive functioning may be in part a result of the physiological processes that occur after physical exercise such as: Increased cerebral perfusion and regional cerebral blood flow. These processes ensure increased oxygenation and glucose transportation to the brain, which together can improve cognitive function. The objective of this narrative review is to examine the contribution of this hypothesis in the care of African older adults with neurodegenerative conditions (i.e., dementia (Alzheimer's disease)) or with mild cognitive impairments. Although studies in developed countries have examined people of African descent (i.e., with African Americans), only the limited findings presented in this review reflect how these conditions are also important for the African continent. This review revealed that no studies have examined the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on neurodegenerative disease in Africa. African nations, like many other developing countries, have an aging population that is growing and will face an increased risk of neurodegenerative declines. It is therefore imperative that new research projects be developed to explore the role of the cardiorespiratory fitness in neurodegenerative disease prevention in African nations.</AbstractText>"}

The comparison between fresh and cryopreserved sperm suggested that cryopreservation facilitated an apoptosis-stress response and redox process, while the comparison between sperm incubated in CAP and NC conditions showed that capacitation increased those biological processes associated with signaling, metabolism, motility, and reproductive processes. In addition, 14 proteins related to mitochondrial activity, sperm motility, oocyte recognition, signaling, spermatogenesis, and the apoptosis-stress response underwent significant changes in abundance over time when fresh and cryopreserved sperm incubated in CAP and NC conditions were compared. Our results indicate that disturbances in a ram sperm proteome after cryopreservation may alter the quality of sperm and its specific machinery to sustain capacitation under in vitro conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Material components should withstand certain temperatures and loads while maintaining high thermal stability under various weather conditions. Solar modules must demonstrate increased reliability, adequate performance, safety, and durability throughout the course of their lifetime. This work presents a novel solar module. The module consists of an innovative polyvinylidene fluoride-short sugar palm fiber (PVDF-SSPF) composite backsheet within its structure. It was electrically and thermally evaluated. The current-voltage characteristics (I-V) were obtained using the solar module analyzer, PROVA 210PV. A thermal evaluation was accomplished using a temperature device, SDL200. The thermal test consisted of two different assessments. The first targeted the surface and backsheet of the developed module to correlate their performance from within. The second assessment compared the thermal performance of the fabricated backsheet with the conventional one. Both tests were combined into a heatmap analysis to further understand the thermal performance. Results revealed that the developed module exhibited reasonable electrical efficiency, achieving appropriate and balanced I-V curves. PVDF-SSPF backsheets proved to be thermally stable by displaying less heat absorbance and better temperature shifts. Additional research efforts are highly encouraged to investigate other characteristics. To enhance performance, further analyses are needed such as the damp heat analysis, accelerated aging analysis, and heat dissipation phenomena.</AbstractText>"}

Nerve excitability of motor axons innervating the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) and fast-twitch tibialis anterior (TA) muscles was tested. The experiments were conducted with pentobarbital sodium (SP) anesthetic and compared with previous results that used ketamine-xylazine (KX). Nerve excitability indices measured with SP show definitive differences between TA and SOL motor axons that extend beyond previous reports. Nerve excitability indices sensitive to changes in <i>I<sub>h</sub></i> indicated an increase in SOL axons compared with TA axons [e.g., S3 <i>t</i> = 7.949 (df = 10), <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus (90-100 ms), <i>t</i> = 2.659 (df = 20); <i>P</i> = 0.01; hyperpolarizing <i>I/V</i> slope, <i>t</i> = 4.308 (df = 19); <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001]. SOL axons also had a longer strength-duration time constant [<i>t</i> = 3.35 (df = 20); <i>P</i> = 0.003] and a longer and larger magnitude relative refractory period [RRP (ms) <i>t</i> = 3.53 (df = 12); <i>P</i> = 0.004; Refractoriness at 2 ms, <i>t</i> = 0.0055 (df = 9); <i>P</i> = 0.006]. Anesthetic choice affected many measures of peripheral nerve excitability with differences most apparent in tests of threshold electrotonus and recovery cycle. For example, recovery cycle with KX lacked a clear superexcitable and late subexcitable period. We conclude that KX had a confounding effect on nerve excitability results consistent with ischemic depolarization. Results using SP revealed the full extent of differences in nerve excitability measures between putative slow and fast motor axons of the rat. These results provide empirical evidence, beyond conduction velocity, that the biophysical properties of motor axons vary with the type of muscle fiber innervated. These differences suggest that fast axons may be predisposed to dysfunction during hyperpolarizing stresses, e.g., electrogenic sodium pumping following sustained impulse conduction.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Nerve excitability testing is a tool used to provide insight into the properties of ion channels in peripheral nerves. It is used clinically to assess pathophysiology of axons. Researchers customarily think of motor axons as homogeneous; however, we demonstrate there are clear differences between fast and slow axons in the rat. This is important for interpreting results with selective motor neuronopathy, like aging where fast axons are at high risk of degeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Currently there is no intervention that cures, prevents, or even slows disease progression. Its complex etiology and pathology pose significant challenges for animal model development, and there is no single model that faithfully recapitulates both the pathological aspects and behavioral phenotypes of AD. Nearly 200 transgenic rodent models of AD have been generated primarily based on mutations linked to Aβ protein misprocessing in the familial form of the disease. More recent models incorporate mutations in tau protein, as well as mutations associated with the sporadic form of the disease. The salient features, strengths, limitations, and key differentiators for the most commonly used and best characterized of these models are considered here. While the translational utility of many of these models to assess the potential of novel therapeutics is in dispute, knowledge of the different models available and a detailed understanding of their features can aid in the selection of the optimal model to explore disease mechanisms or evaluate candidate medications. We comment on the predictive utility of these models considering recent clinical trial failures and discuss trends and future directions in the development of models for AD based on the plethora of clinical data that have been generated over the last decade. © 2019 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, there are important ethnic differences in the pathogenesis and cardio-/cerebrovascular consequences of hypertension. Given the large populations and rapidly aging demographic in Asian regions, optimal strategies to diagnose and manage hypertension are of high importance. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is an important out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurement tool that should play a central role in hypertension detection and management. The use of ABPM is particularly important in Asia due to the specific features of hypertension in Asian patients, including a high prevalence of masked hypertension, disrupted BP variability with marked morning BP surge, and nocturnal hypertension. This HOPE Asia Network document summarizes region-specific literature on the relationship between ABPM parameters and cardiovascular risk and target organ damage, providing a rationale for consensus-based recommendations on the use of ABPM in Asia. The aim of these recommendations is to guide and improve clinical practice to facilitate optimal BP monitoring with the goal of optimizing patient management and expediting the efficient allocation of treatment and health care resources. This should contribute to the HOPE Asia Network mission of improving the management of hypertension and organ protection toward achieving 'zero' cardiovascular events in Asia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>©2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this work, a nitric oxide releasing contact lens gel displaying broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against two of the most common causative pathogens of microbial keratitis is described. The contact lens gel is composed of poly-ε-lysine (pεK) functionalized with nitric oxide (NO) releasing diazeniumdiolate moieties which enables the controlled and sustained release of bactericidal concentrations of NO at physiological pH over a period of 15 h. Diazeniumdiolate functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and the concentration of NO released from the gels was determined by chemiluminescence. The bactericidal efficacy of the gels against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was ascertained, and between 1 and 4 log reductions in bacterial populations were observed over 24 h.

In the past 28 years, huge efforts have been made in attempting to treat the disease by reducing brain accumulation of amyloid-β in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with no success. While anti-amyloid-β therapies continue to be tested in prodromal patients with Alzheimer's disease and in subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need to provide therapeutic support to patients with established Alzheimer's disease for whom current symptomatic treatment (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl d-aspartate antagonist) provide limited help. The possibility of an infectious aetiology for Alzheimer's disease has been repeatedly postulated over the past three decades. Infiltration of the brain by pathogens may act as a trigger or co-factor for Alzheimer's disease, with Herpes simplex virus type 1, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Porphyromonas gingivalis being most frequently implicated. These pathogens may directly cross a weakened blood-brain barrier, reach the CNS and cause neurological damage by eliciting neuroinflammation. Alternatively, pathogens may cross a weakened intestinal barrier, reach vascular circulation and then cross blood-brain barrier or cause low grade chronic inflammation and subsequent neuroinflammation from the periphery. The gut microbiota comprises a complex community of microorganisms. Increased permeability of the gut and blood-brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may impact Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Inflammatory microorganisms in gut microbiota are associated with peripheral inflammation and brain amyloid-β deposition in subjects with cognitive impairment. Oral microbiota may also influence Alzheimer's disease risk through circulatory or neural access to the brain. At least two possibilities can be envisaged to explain the association of suspected pathogens and Alzheimer's disease. One is that patients with Alzheimer's disease are particularly prone to microbial infections. The other is that microbial infection is a contributing cause of Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic trials with antivirals and/or antibacterials could resolve this dilemma. Indeed, antiviral agents are being tested in patients with Alzheimer's disease in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Although combined antibiotic therapy was found to be effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, antibacterial drugs are not being widely investigated in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This is because it is not clear which bacterial populations in the gut of patients with Alzheimer's disease are overexpressed and if safe, selective antibacterials are available for them. On the other hand, a bacterial protease inhibitor targeting P. gingivalis toxins is now being tested in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Clinical studies are needed to test if countering bacterial infection may be beneficial in patients with established Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

We highlight the challenges that the evolving landscape in HIV brings, including managing an aging and more diverse population of PLHIV; this requires a shift from managing disease to managing health and may best be achieved by multidisciplinary teams in the long term. We introduce the concept of 'health goals for me:' an individualized approach to the management of HIV, and use this as the basis for a proposed framework for assessing health-related quality of life for PLHIV. Our framework comprises a continuous cycle of 'ask and measure,' 'feedback and discussion,' and 'intervention,' based on collaboration between the health-care professional and patient.

Its impact is actively studied in cardiovascular diseases representing major public health issues, like hypertension, but ASI could also play a role in aging and many more pathological processes including cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 médecine/sciences – Inserm.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Red bean or Adzuki bean (<i>Vigna angularis</i>) has been consumed as an edible legume. Red bean possesses various functional properties, such as antidiabetes, antiaging, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and hepatoprotective activities. However, little is known about its potential inhibitory effect on muscle atrophy. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of red bean extract (RBE) on muscle atrophy in an immobilized hindlimb muscle of C57BL/6J mice. RBE dose-dependently increased grip strength, exercise endurance, muscle weight, and myofiber area. At the molecular level, RBE significantly reduced the mRNA expression of proteolysis-related genes, such as muscle ring finger and muscle atrophy F-box by preventing the translocation of Forkhead box 3. RBE also activated the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt pathway, subsequently stimulating the mammalian target of rapamycin/70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 pathway involved in protein synthesis. Overall, red bean could be used as a functional food ingredient or therapeutic agent to inhibit muscle atrophy.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is known that several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) form toxic aggregates and also interact with tau in such granules in tauopathies, including AD. The Musashi (MSI) family of RBPs, consisting of two homologues: Musashi1 and Musashi2, have not been extensively investigated in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, using a tau inducible HEK (iHEK) model we investigate whether MSI proteins contribute to the aggregation of toxic tau oligomers (TauO). Wild-type and mutant P301L tau iHEK cells are used to study the effect of different tau variants on the cellular localization of MSI proteins. Interestingly, we observe that tau co-localizes with MSI in the cytoplasm and nuclei, altering the nuclear transport of MSI. Furthermore, incremental changes in the size and density of nuclear MSI/tau foci are observed. We also report here that TauO interact with MSI to cause the formation of distinct nuclear aggregates. Moreover, tau/MSI aggregates induce structural changes to LaminB1, leading to nuclear instability. These results illustrate a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration mediated by the aggregation of MSI proteins and TauO, suggesting that MSI plays a critical role in cellular dysfunction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

To investigate whether epigenetic mechanisms influence the penetrance and expressivity of colour morphs in H. axyridis, we used RNA interference to silence key enzymes required for DNA methylation and histone modification. We found that neither of these epigenetic mechanisms affected the frequency of different morphs, but there was a significant impact on life-history traits such as longevity and fecundity. Strikingly, we found that silencing the gene encoding for DNA methyltransferase 1 associated protein 1 (DMAP1) severely reduced female fecundity, which correlated with an abundance of degenerated ovaries in DMAP1-knockdown female beetles.

Single and combined heat and calcium treatments partially delayed fruit senescence, as evidenced by changes in fruit colour darkening, skin penetration force, and respiration activity. Calcium content was noticeably increased by heat in Ca-treated fruit. Several primary metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, and alcohols, were decreased in response to both treatments, while many soluble sugars and secondary metabolites were increased within 1 day post-treatment. Changes of several metabolites in heat-treated fruits, especially esculetin, peonidin 3-O-glucoside and peonidin 3-O-galactoside, ribose, pyroglutamate, and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, were detected.

While the minimum daily allowances of nutrients to prevent disease have been established, the optimal nutritional state for skin health is unknown. This single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 50 female subjects, aged 35 to 65 years, with mild-to-moderate photoaging and stable prescription medication usage for three months prior to study enrollment. All nutritional supplements were stopped at two weeks prior to study entry. Subjects took three morning and three evening supplement tablets or an equal number of placebo sugar pills to maintain the blinding. The blinded investigator rated a statistically significant improvement at Week 8 compared to baseline, which continued into Week 12, for the active supplement over the placebo in terms of firmness (<i>p</i>=0.035), hydration (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001), dullness (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001), and overall skin appearance (<i>p</i>=0.010). The subjects noted a statistically significant improvement in healing (<i>p</i>=0.042), hydration (<i>p</i>=0.004), dullness (<i>p</i>=0.003), roughness (<i>p</i>=0.015), pigmentation (<i>p</i>=0.025), and overall appearance (<i>p</i>=0.005) at Week 8 that also continued into Week 12. In addition, the subjects completed a quality of life evaluation, which split statistically from placebo in all attributes at Week 12. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in wrinkle breadth in the supplement group compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i>=0.018), as analyzed from laser-scanned silicone replicas from the left orbit when comparing baseline to Week 12. These findings support the value of the study supplement in improving skin appearance.</AbstractText>"}

The insufficient level of carbohydrates forces the body to primarily use fat instead of sugar as a fuel source. Due to its characteristic, KD has often been used to treat metabolic disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle constitutes 40% of total body mass and is one of the major sites of glucose disposal. KD is a well-defined approach to induce weight loss, with its role in muscle adaptation and muscle hypertrophy less understood. Considering this lack of knowledge, the aim of this review was to examine the scientific evidence about the effects of KD on muscle hypertrophy. We first described the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy per se, and secondly, we discussed the characteristics and the metabolic function of KD. Ultimately, we provided the potential mechanism that could explain the influence of KD on skeletal muscle hypertrophy.</AbstractText>"}

Ageing is defined as the progressive loss of physiological integrity, which can be characterized by functional impairment and high vulnerability to various types of diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and atherosclerosis. Numerous studies have reported that the presence of oxidative stress and inflammation contributes to the development of these diseases. In general, oxidative stress could induce proinflammatory cytokines and reduce cellular antioxidant capacity. Increased oxidative stress levels beyond the production of antioxidant agents cause oxidative damage to biological molecules, including DNA, protein, and carbohydrates, which affects normal cell signalling, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis and leads to disease pathogenesis. Since oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to these diseases, ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale</i> Roscoe) is one of the potential herbs that can be used to reduce the level of oxidative stress and inflammation. Ginger consists of two major active components, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, which are essential for preventing oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, this paper will review the effects of ginger on ageing and degenerative diseases, including AD, PD, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and osteoarthritis.</AbstractText>"}

CIL is unstable in solid state and decomposes rapidly under humid conditions. It requires stabilization to ensure safety of its use. The studied CIL/PVP formulations were prepared by milling and evaporation technique. Their identity was confirmed by FT-IR method. The stability of CIL in the CIL/PVP formulations was assessed by forced ageing test under isothermic conditions using RP-HPLC. The influence of temperature (experimental conditions: RH 76.4% and T = 70, 75, 80, 85, and 90 <sup>o</sup>C) and the effect of relative humidity (experimental conditions: RH 25.0%, 50.9%, 60.9%, 66.5%, 76.4%, T = 90 °C) on the rate of CIL degradation were examined. It was established that the process of CIL decay in the studied forms followed first-order kinetics with the formation of one degradation product - cilazaprilat. The degradation rate constant of this reaction was lower than that for pure CIL. The energy of activation of the CIL degradation in the presence of PVP was higher than that of pure CIL. Furthermore, CIL incorporated into PVP exhibited lower sensitivity to moisture. Based on these data PVP was considered as a potential stabilizing substance for CIL-containing dosage forms.</AbstractText>"}

At least one disorder was recorded in 2099 (64.9%) Persians. The most common specific disorders were haircoat disorders (411, 12.7%), periodontal disease (365, 11.3%), overgrown nails (234, 7.2%), and ocular discharge (188, 5.8%). The most common disorder groups were dermatological (578, 17.9%), ophthalmological (496, 15.3%) and dental (397, 12.3%). Median longevity was 13.5 years (IQR 9.9-16.0). The most common grouped causes of death were renal disease (102, 23.4%), neoplasia (37, 8.5%) and mass-associated disorder (35, 8.0%). This is the first study to use general practice data to examine the overall health of Persian cats. With haircoat, ocular and dental disorders being the predominant disorders identified, this study highlights the need for increased owner awareness to manage and prevent the typical health problems associated with this breed's phenotype.</AbstractText>"}

Due to their unique perfusion of the nerve fibre layer the RPCs are particularly significant for optic-neuropathies. The inputs to the analysis were z-stacks from 3D confocal fluorescence microscopy from 62 human retinas aged 9 to 84 years. Our aim was to find morphometric correlates of age. The retinas had no ophthalmic history. The analysis was undertaken in two stages: (1) converting the z-stacks to 3D tubular networks of vessels, and (2) characterizing the tubular networks using features derived from the Minkowski functionals (MFs). The MFs measure: the capillary volume, surface area, mean breadth, and Euler number. The mean breadth is related to tortuosity, wall shear stress and resistance to flow, and the Euler number is related to the density of loops (collaterals). Features derived from the surface area, mean breadth and Euler number were most related to age (all p ≤ 0.006). The results indicate the importance of pressure-equalizing loops and tortuosity as quantitative measures related to perfusion efficiency. The novel morphometric analysis could quantify disease-related accelerated aging and vessel malformation.</AbstractText>"}

An intense permanent anticyclone in the basin impacts the regional hydrography, energetics, and ecosystem. Repeated sampling of this Lofoten Basin Eddy from dedicated cruises, autonomous profiling gliders, and acoustically-tracked subsurface floats enables the documentation of its dynamics and energetics over the course of 15 months. The eddy core, in nearly solid-body rotation, exhibits an unusually low vertical vorticity close to the local inertial frequency and important strain rates at the periphery. Subsurface floats as deep as 800 m are trapped within the core for their entire deployment duration (up to 15 months). The potential vorticity is reduced in the core by two orders of magnitude relative to the surroundings, creating a barrier. In the winter, this barrier weakens and lateral exchanges and heat flux between the eddy and the surroundings increase, apparently the result of dynamical instabilities and a possible eddy merger. Based on a simple energy budget, the dissipation timescale for the eddy energy is three years, during which wintertime convection seasonally modulates potential and kinetic energy.</AbstractText>"}

Significant differences in the retinal reflectance spectra are found between individuals with high Aβ burden on brain PET imaging and mild cognitive impairment (n = 15), and age-matched PET-negative controls (n = 20). Retinal imaging scores are correlated with brain Aβ loads. The findings are validated in an independent cohort, using a second hyperspectral camera.

Prior studies suggested that inhibition of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) through soluble activin receptor type II (ActRII) ligand traps or neutralizing antibodies promotes erythroid precursor cell maturation and red blood cell formation in contexts of homeostasis and anemia. As Gdf11 is expressed by mature hematopoietic cells, and erythroid precursor cell expression of Gdf11 has been implicated in regulating erythropoiesis, we hypothesized that genetic disruption of Gdf11 in blood cells might perturb normal hematopoiesis or recovery from hematopoietic insult. Contrary to these predictions, we found that deletion of Gdf11 in the hematopoietic lineage in mice does not alter erythropoiesis or erythroid precursor cell frequency under normal conditions or during hematopoietic recovery after irradiation and transplantation. In addition, although hematopoietic cell-derived Gdf11 may contribute to the pool of circulating GDF11 protein during adult homeostasis, loss of Gdf11 specifically in the blood system does not impair hematopoietic stem cell function or induce overt pathological consequences. Taken together, these results reveal that hematopoietic cell-derived Gdf11 is largely dispensable for native and transplant-induced blood formation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recently, changes in DNA methylation were shown to contribute to various ageing processes. However, it is unknown whether such changes also contribute to age-related kidney dysfunction. To assess this, we profiled genome-wide changes in DNA methylation (over 800 000 CpG sites) in 95 renal biopsies obtained prior to kidney transplantation from donors aged 16 to 73 years. Donor age significantly associated with the methylation of 92 778 CpGs (false discovery rate under 0.05), corresponding to 10 285 differentially methylated regions. These regions were most frequently located in genes involved in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Using an independent cohort of 67 biopsies, we autonomously validated these findings. Interestingly, the methylation status of these 92 778 age-related CpGs was associated with glomerulosclerosis (34.4% of CpGs at a false discovery rate under 0.05) and interstitial fibrosis (0.9%) and graft function at one year after transplantation, but not with tubular atrophy and arteriosclerosis. No association was observed with any of these pathologies at the time of transplantation (0% at a false discovery rate under 0.05). Thus, age-associated changes in DNA methylation at the time of transplantation predict future injury of transplanted kidneys. Specifically, our epigenome-wide association study demonstrates that epigenetic renal ageing is implicated in progressive fibrosis in both the glomerulus and the interstitium.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

Subjects were 554 women aged 65-72 years from the Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention - Fracture Prevention Study. Women reported the hours and type of PA and lifestyle factors via questionnaires and dietary intake using the 3-d food record. Adequate PA was considered according to WHO recommendation: PA = 0, 0 &lt; PA &lt; 2·5 and ≥2·5 h/week. BSD score was categorised as &lt;13 or ≥13 based on the median score. LS was self-reported using LS scale with four items on current 'interest', 'happiness in life', 'ease of living' and 'feelings of loneliness' (range: 4-20, lower score representing higher satisfaction). After adjusting for the confounders, PA was statistically significantly associated with lower LS score (β coefficient = -0·207, P = 0·001), where women with PA ≥ 2·5 h/week had the lowest LS score followed by women with 0 &lt; PA &lt; 2·5 and PA = 0 (Pfor trend = 0·020). Association between BSD and LS was NS. Only among women with BSD score ≥ 13, but not BSD &lt; 13, PA ≥ 2·5 h/week was statistically significantly associated with lower LS score (mean = 9·3), followed by 0 &lt; PA &lt; 2·5 (mean = 9·9) and PA = 0 groups (mean = 11·8) (Pfor trend = 0·033).

Given the epidemiological evidence that air pollution exposure during pregnancy adversely affects newborn outcomes such as birth weight and preterm birth, there is a need to pay attention to underlying modes of action to better understand not only these air pollution-induced early health effects but also its later-life consequences. In this review, we give an overview of air pollution-induced placental molecular alterations observed in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort and evaluate the existing evidence. In general, we showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with nitrosative stress and epigenetic alterations in the placenta. Adversely affected CpG targets were involved in cellular processes including DNA repair, circadian rhythm, and energy metabolism. For miRNA expression, specific air pollution exposure windows were associated with altered miR-20a, miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-222 expression. Early-life aging markers including telomere length and mitochondrial DNA content are associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy. Previously, we proposed the air pollution-induced telomere-mitochondrial aging hypothesis with a direct link between telomeres and mitochondria. Here, we extend this view with a potential co-interaction of different biological mechanisms on the level of placental oxidative stress, epigenetics, aging, and energy metabolism. Investigating the placenta is an opportunity for future research as it may help to understand the fundamental biology underpinning the DOHaD concept through the interactions between the underlying modes of action, prenatal environment, and disease risk in later life. To prevent lasting consequences from early-life exposures of air pollution, policy makers should get a basic understanding of biomolecular consequences and transgenerational risks.</AbstractText>"}

A dominant paradigm maintains that ageing evolves due to the competing energy demands of reproduction and somatic maintenance leading to slow accumulation of unrepaired cellular damage with age. However, the centrality of energy trade-offs in ageing has been increasingly challenged as studies in different organisms have uncoupled the trade-off between reproduction and longevity. An emerging theory is that ageing instead is caused by biological processes that are optimized for early-life function but become harmful when they continue to run-on unabated in late life. This idea builds on the realization that early-life regulation of gene expression can break down in late life because natural selection is too weak to optimize it. Empirical evidence increasingly supports the hypothesis that suboptimal gene expression in adulthood can result in physiological malfunction leading to organismal senescence. We argue that the current state of the art in the study of ageing contradicts the widely held view that energy trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and longevity are the universal underpinning of senescence. Future research should focus on understanding the relative contribution of energy and function trade-offs to the evolution and expression of ageing.</AbstractText>"}

This study assesses the relationships of alcohol consumption status with basic daily activities among Chinese older adults. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 5,133 participants aged 60 years or above from three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (2009, 2012, and 2014) were analyzed. Independent ADL items included bathing, dressing, toileting, indoor moving, continence, and feeding (without others' assistance). Multilevel ordered logistic regression model estimation was used to examine the results of total scores based on the Katz index. Multilevel logistic regression models also were estimated to study each index item separately to examine differences across each of the six ADLs. Additional confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to examine the validity of the index. <b>Results:</b> Preliminary CFA showed that most items had good factor loadings (&gt;0.700), except for continence (0.256) and feeding (0.481). Based on the ordered regression model, former (AOR = 0.412, 95% CI: 0.294, 0.579, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and non-alcohol consumption (AOR = 0.598, 95% CI: 0.447, 0.800, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were negatively associated with the total score. Non-alcohol consumption status was negatively associated with ADL items separately (all <i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05), with the exceptions of continence and feeding. <b>Conclusion:</b> Alcohol consumption may be associated with Chinese older adults' better ADLs. However, further clinical or experimental trials are needed to examine the impact of alcohol consumption on older adults' ADLs.</AbstractText>"}

Findings were compared to genetically long-lived male Ames dwarf mice. Stifles were analyzed histologically with articular cartilage structure (ACS) and safranin O scoring as well as with quantitative histomorphometry.<b>Results</b>: Depending on the experimental group, ITP mice were between 450 and 1150 days old at the time of necropsy and 12-15 animals were studied per group. Two age groups (450 and 750 days) with 16-20 animals per group were used for Ames dwarf studies. No differences were found in the ACS or safranin O scores between treatment and control groups in the ITP study. There was high variability in most of the histologic outcome measures. For example, the older UM-HET3 controls had ACS scores of 6.1 ± 5.8 (mean±SD) and Saf O scores of 6.8 ± 5.6. Nevertheless, 17-α-estradiol mice had larger areas and widths of subchondral bone compared to controls, and dwarf mice had less subchondral bone area and width and less articular cartilage necrosis than non-dwarf controls.<b>Conclusions</b>: UM-HET3 mice developed age-related OA but with a high degree of variability and without a significant effect of the tested ITP treatments. High variability was also seen in the Ames dwarf mice but differences in several measures suggested some protection from OA.</AbstractText>"}

The results showed that 15 µM sodium selenite significantly increased phenolics compounds, flavonoids compounds, anthocyanins, and some essential amino acid content, while improving the total antioxidant capacity of radish sprouts. Besides, the Se-enriched radish sprouts significantly alleviated the liver damage caused by carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub> ) in mice and improved the antioxidant capacity of the liver in mice, whereas the Se-enriched radish sprouts alleviated the inflammatory reaction and apoptosis caused by CCl<sub>4</sub> . These results imply that Se-enriched radish sprouts have a positive impact on mice with CCl<sub>4</sub> -induced liver injury, and that in future Se-enriched radish sprouts could be developed into an effective food and health care product for the liver injury prevention. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Because selenium is an essential trace element in the human body, selenium-enriched sprouts can help eliminate free radicals in the body, relieve aging, and selenium-deficient diseases.

The model was based on measurements in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. However, recent data showing that nitrate output in streams is declining across this region even as forests are aging seem to be inconsistent with this theory. Because the more recent data do not match the predictions of the Vitousek and Reiners model, either new hypotheses, or modifications of the original hypothesis, need to be considered. I suggest that the original model can be amended by accounting for increased woody debris; an accumulation of both above and belowground high C:N coarse woody debris from tree mortality in these regenerating forests can lead to high microbial immobilization of N and can explain the recent patterns of declining stream nitrate. Few studies or models have attempted to calculate the impacts of coarse woody debris (CWD) decomposition products to the retention of C and N in forested ecosystems and their receiving streams, but evidence suggests that CWD can significantly affect stream N exports and should be considered in future models of ecosystem biogeochemical cycles.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, not all HR-deficient tumors efficiently respond to PARP inhibition and often acquire resistance. It is therefore important to uncover how PARP inhibitors induce cytotoxicity and develop combination strategies to potentiate PARP inhibitor efficacy in HR-deficient tumors. In this study, we found that forced mitotic entry upon ATR inhibition potentiates cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibition using olaparib in BRCA2-depleted and Brca2 knockout cancer cell line models. Single DNA fiber analysis showed that ATR inhibition does not exacerbate replication fork degradation. Instead, we find ATR inhibitors accelerate mitotic entry, resulting in the formation of chromatin bridges and lagging chromosomes. Furthermore, using genome-wide single-cell sequencing, we show that ATR inhibition enhances genomic instability of olaparib-treated BRCA2-depleted cells. Inhibition of CDK1 to delay mitotic entry mitigated mitotic aberrancies and genomic instability upon ATR inhibition, underscoring the role of ATR in coordinating proper cell cycle timing in situations of DNA damage. Additionally, we show that olaparib treatment leads to increased numbers of micronuclei, which is accompanied by a cGAS/STING-associated inflammatory response in BRCA2-deficient cells. ATR inhibition further increased the numbers of cGAS-positive micronuclei and the extent of cytokine production in olaparib-treated BRCA2-deficient cancer cells. Altogether, we show that ATR inhibition induces premature mitotic entry and mediates synergistic cytotoxicity with PARP inhibition in HR-deficient cancer cells, which involves enhanced genomic instability and inflammatory signaling.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Determining amino acid digestibility in humans, as the disappearance of an amino acid across the total digestive tract, has been discredited. Extensive cecal and colonic microbial metabolism renders fecal estimates of amino acids misleading. True ileal amino acid digestibility determined at the end of the small intestine predicts amino acid uptake more accurately. Given that ileal digestibility determination cannot be undertaken routinely in humans, a pig-based assay has been developed and validated. The growing pig values for digestibility, however, relate to healthy adult humans and there is a need to be able to determine amino acid digestibility for humans with specific physiological states. To this end, isotope-based methods for determining dietary amino acid digestibility indirectly show promise but remain to be fully validated.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

CPB is a cationic surfactant with antibacterial activity that can be used to modify the surface properties of SPs, especially at variable CPB loading levels (SP-CPB0.5, SP-CPB2.5, and SP-CPB5.0, where the numeric suffix represents the synthetic loading level of CPB in mM). The SP-CPB0.5 sample displayed optimal surface area and pore structure properties that was selected for water sorption isotherm studies at 25 °C. The CPB-coated SPs sample (SP-CPB0.5) showed an improved water vapor uptake capacity compared to unmodified starch (SPs) and other desiccant systems such as high amylose starch (HAS<sub>15</sub>) and silica gel (SG<sub>13</sub>). Single-step and cyclic water vapor sorption tests were conducted using a small-scale exchanger coated with SP-CPB0.5. The calculated latent effectiveness values obtained from direct measurements using cyclic tests (65.4 ± 2%) agree closely with the estimated latent effectiveness from single-step tests (64.6 ± 2%) at controlled operating conditions. Compared to HAS<sub>15</sub>- and SG<sub>13</sub>-coated exchangers, the SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger performed much better at controlled operating conditions, along with improved longevity due to the CPB surface coating. The presence of CPB did not attenuate the uptake properties of native SPs. Latent effectiveness of SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger was enhanced (5-30% higher) over that of the SG<sub>13</sub>- or HAS<sub>15</sub>-coated exchangers, according to the wheel angular speed. This study reports on a novel and sustainable SP-CPB0.5 material as a promising desiccant coating with tunable uptake and surface properties with potential utility in air-to-air energy exchangers for ventilation systems.</AbstractText>"}

Targeting human carriers and potential animal reservoir infections will be critical to achieving this ambitious goal. However, there is continuing debate regarding the significance of reservoir host animals, wild and domestic, in different epidemiological contexts, whilst the extent and duration of the asymptomatic human carrier state is similarly undefined. This paper reviews the status of the knowledge of latent infections in wild and domestic animal reservoir hosts towards the goal of better understanding their role in the transmission dynamic of the disease. Focus areas include the transmission cycles in non-human hosts, the infectivity of animal reservoirs to <i>Glossina palpalis</i> s.l., the longevity of infection and the stability of <i>T. b. gambiense</i> biological characteristics in antelopes and domestic animals. There is compelling evidence that <i>T. b. gambiense</i> can establish and persist in experimentally infected antelopes, pigs and dogs for a period of at least two years. In particular, metacyclic transmission of <i>T. b. gambiense</i> has been reported in antelope-<i>G.p.palpalis</i>-antelope and pig-<i>G.p.gambiensis</i>-pig cycles. Experimental studies demonstrate that the infectiveness of latent animal reservoir infections with <i>T. b. gambiense</i> is retained in animal-<i>Glossina</i>-animal cycles (antelopes and pigs) for periods of three years and human infectivity markers (human serum resistance, zymodeme, DNA) are stable in non-human hosts for the same period. These observations shed light on the epidemiological significance of animal reservoir hosts in specific ecosystems characterized by presently active, as well as known 'old' HAT foci whilst challenging the concept of total elimination of all transmission by 2030. This target is also compromised by the existence of human asymptomatic carriers of <i>T. b. gambiense</i> often detected outside Africa after having lived outside tsetse infested areas for many years - sometimes decades. Non-tsetse modes of transmission may also play a significant but underestimated role in the maintenance of foci and also preclude the total elimination of transmission - these include mother to child transmission and sexual transmission. Both these modes of transmission have been the subject of case reports yet their frequency in African settings remains to be ascertained when the context of residual foci are discussed yet both challenge the concept of the possibility of the total elimination of transmission.</AbstractText>"}

We argue that open science is important for aging research, both to reduce questionable research practices that may also be prevalent in the field (such as too many reported significant age differences in the literature, underpowered studies, hypothesizing after the results are known, and lack of belief updating when findings do not support theories), as well as to make research in the field more transparent overall. To ensure the credibility of gerontology research moving forward, we suggest concrete ways to incorporate open science into gerontology research: for example, by using available preregistration templates adaptable to a variety of study designs typical for aging research (even secondary analyses of existing data). Larger sample sizes may be achieved by many-lab collaborations.

The cause of these epigenetic alterations is largely unknown. We set out to test whether (i) islet DNA methylation would change with aging and (ii) early postnatal overnutrition would persistently alter DNA methylation. We performed genome-scale DNA methylation profiling in islets from postnatally over-nourished (suckled in a small litter) and control male mice at both postnatal day 21 and postnatal day 180. DNA methylation differences were validated using quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing, and associations with expression were assessed by RT-PCR. We discovered that genomic regions that are hypermethylated in exocrine relative to endocrine pancreas tend to gain methylation in islets during aging (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.33, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). These methylation differences were inversely correlated with mRNA expression of genes relevant to β cell function [including <i>Rab3b</i> (Ras-related protein Rab-3B), <i>Cacnb3</i> (voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit 3), <i>Atp2a3</i> (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 3) and <i>Ins2</i> (insulin 2)]. Relative to control, small litter islets showed DNA methylation differences directly after weaning and in adulthood, but few of these were present at both ages. Surprisingly, we found substantial overlap of methylated loci caused by aging and small litter feeding, suggesting that the age-associated gain of DNA methylation happened much earlier in small litter islets than control islets. Our results provide the novel insights that aging-associated DNA methylation increases reflect an epigenetic drift toward the exocrine pancreas epigenome, and that early postnatal overnutrition may accelerate this process.</AbstractText>"}

Aging is associated not only with the comorbidities stemming from their inherited bleeding disorder (arthropathy, chronic viral infections such as hepatitis and AIDS) but also with the multiple chronic ailments associated with aging (cancer, cardiovascular disease, COPD). Multimorbidity is inevitably associated with polypharmacy, i.e., the chronic daily intake of at least five drugs, and with the related risk of severe adverse events associated with the use of inappropriate drugs and drug-drug interactions. Information on the pattern of drug prescription and usage by PWH is relatively scanty, but on the whole, the available data indicate that the rate of polypharmacy, as well as the risk of drug-drug interaction, is relatively low in PWH and better than that in their age peers without hemophilia followed by general practitioners. It is believed that this advantage results from the collaborative coordination on drug prescribing exerted, through their integration with practitioners and organ specialists, by specialized hemophilia treatment centers in the frame of comprehensive care programs. However, the available cross-sectional data were mainly obtained in relatively young PWH, so that there is a need to obtain more accurate data from the ongoing prospective studies that are being carried out in more and more progressively aging PWH.</AbstractText>"}

Deposition of amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing phospho-Tau (pTau) are the pathognomonic features of AD. In the neuropathologic evaluation of AD, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the current standard method for detection of Aβ42 and pTau. Although IHC is indispensable for determining the distribution of AD pathology, it is of rather limited use for assessment of the quantity of AD pathology. We have recently developed Luminex-based assays for the quantitative assessment of Aβ42 and pTau in AD brains. These assays are based on the same antibodies that are used for the IHC-based diagnosis of AD neuropathologic change. Here we report the application and extension of such quantitative AD neuropathology assays to commonly used genetically engineered AD models and to animals that develop AD neuropathologic change as they age naturally.

Several reflective markers over bony landmarks on the lower extremities were used to capture movements. We evaluated the correlations of variables calculated between the trunk accelerometers and the motion analysis system. [Results] Walking speed was positively correlated with harmonic ratios along the anteroposterior axis and stride regularity along the vertical and anteroposterior axes. Harmonic ratios were associated with the stance phase percent on the unaffected side. Stride regularity was associated with the stance phase percent on both sides. Smaller interstride variability was associated with smaller peak ankle plantarflexion during both phases and greater peak ankle dorsiflexion during swing phase. Stride regularity is positively associated with maximal knee flexion during swing phase.

The genetic determinism of phenotypes is not always obvious and could be circumstantial in complex organisms. In symbiotic cnidarians, it is known that morphology or colour can misrepresent a complex genetic and symbiotic diversity. Anemonia viridis is a symbiotic sea anemone from temperate seas. This species displays different colour morphs based on pigment content and lives in a wide geographical range. Here, we investigated whether colour morph differentiation correlated with host genetic diversity or associated symbiotic genetic diversity by using RAD sequencing and symbiotic dinoflagellate typing of 140 sea anemones from the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. We did not observe genetic differentiation among colour morphs of A. viridis at the animal host or symbiont level, rejecting the hypothesis that A. viridis colour morphs correspond to species level differences. Interestingly, we however identified at least four independent animal host genetic lineages in A. viridis that differed in their associated symbiont populations.

To elucidate the role of CPT1A, we established a Cpt1a P479L mouse strain and evaluated its sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction. Since CPT1a is a key molecule in lipid metabolism, we compared the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) and normal diet (ND) on disease progression. The disease severity increased significantly in WT mice compared to that in Cpt1 P479L mice. In addition, WT mice receiving HFD showed markedly exacerbated disease course when compared either with Cpt1a P479L mice receiving HFD or WT control group receiving ND. Induction of EAE caused a significant decrease of myelin basic protein expression in the hindbrain of disease affected WT mice in comparison to Cpt1a P479L mice. Further, WT mice showed increased expression of oxidative stress markers like Nox2 and Ho-1, whereas expression of mitochondrial antioxidants regulator Pgc1α was increased in Cpt1a P479L mice. Our results suggest that, lipids metabolism play an important role in EAE, as shown by the higher severity of disease progression in both WT EAE and WT EAF HFD-fed mice in contrast to their counterpart Cpt1a P479L mutant mice. Interestingly, mice with downregulated lipid metabolism due to the Cpt1a P479L mutation showed resistance to EAE induction. These findings support a key role for CPT1A in the development of EAE and could be a promising target in MS treatment.</AbstractText>"}

Hence, the impact of transcriptomic changes on the operational level of proteins is predicted to be relatively modest. To investigate this, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and mRNA sequencing at seven developmental stages, from the mature oocyte to the blastocyst, and independently validated our data by immunofluorescence and qPCR. We detected and quantified 6,550 proteins and 20,535 protein-coding transcripts. In contrast to the transcriptome - where changes occur early, mostly at the 2-cell stage - our data indicate that the most substantial changes in the proteome take place towards later stages, between the morula and blastocyst. We also found little to no concordance between the changes in protein and transcript levels, especially for early stages, but observed that the concordance increased towards the morula and blastocyst, as did the number of free ribosomes. These results are consistent with the cytoplasmic lattice-to-free ribosome transition being a key mediator of developmental regulation. Finally, we show how these data can be used to appraise the strengths and limitations of mRNA-based studies of pre-implantation development and expand on the list of known developmental markers.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, we illuminated the mechanisms by which podocyte senescence causes tubular impairment by stimulating HK-2 cells with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and chloroquine. Our findings suggest that C/EBPα knockout in podocytes aggravates podocyte senescence through the AMPK/mTOR pathway, leading to glomerulosclerosis, and that subsequent albuminuria exacerbates the epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation of senescent tubular cells by suppressing autophagy.

Consequently, equol has been endorsed as having many beneficial effects on human health. The conversion of daidzein into equol takes place in the intestine via the action of reductase enzymes belonging to incompletely characterized members of the gut microbiota. While all animal species analyzed so far produce equol, only between one third and one half of human subjects (depending on the community) are able to do so, ostensibly those that harbor equol-producing microbes.

Cordycepin treatment significantly reduced the cell survival rate of T24 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis. Cordycepin activated caspase-8 and -9, which are involved in the initiation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, respectively, and also increased caspase-3 activity, a typical effect caspase, subsequently leading to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Additionally, cordycepin increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and truncation of Bid, and destroyed the integrity of mitochondria, which contributed to the cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Moreover, cordycepin effectively inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, while LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor, increased the apoptosis-inducing effect of cordycepin. Cordycepin further enhanced the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the addition of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor, significantly diminished cordycepin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and growth inhibition, and also blocked the inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

We aimed to investigate if PTEN/Akt activates AEC senescence to induce pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated the association between PTEN/Akt and cellular senescence in lung tissues from IPF patients. As a result, decreased PTEN and activated Akt pathway were found in AECs in fibrotic lung tissues detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). Increased expression levels of aging-associated markers (P21<sup>WAF1</sup> and SA-β-gal) in AECs treated with bleomycin were found. AEC senescence was accelerated by PTEN knockdown and attenuated by PTEN overexpression. Bleomycin induced AEC senescence was reversed by Akt2 knockdown and the pharmacological inhibitors (LY294002 and MK2206) of the Akt pathway. Reducing Akt activation dramatically improved lung fibrosis in a fibrotic mice model. In addition, a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay demonstrated that PTEN physically associated with Akt. These indicated that senescent AECs modulated by the PTEN/Akt pathway promote lung fibrosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that as a trigger indicator in IPF, the senescence process in AECs should be a potential therapeutic target and that the PTEN/Akt pathway may be a promising candidate for intervention.</AbstractText>"}

We found that the expression of hnRNPR was significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers compared to the normal tissues. Functionally, hnRNPR promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of hnRNPR in two type mice models, with two types of tumors models decreased the tumor aggressiveness and metastasis.

An elaborate regulatory system within cells, the protein homeostasis network, safeguards that proteins are correctly folded and functional. At the heart of this regulatory system lies a class of specialized protein quality control enzymes called chaperones that are tasked with assisting proteins in their folding, avoiding aggregation and degradation. Failure and decline of protein homeostasis are directly associated with conditions of aging and aging-related neurodegeneration. However, it is not clear what tips the balance of protein homeostasis and leads to onset of aging and diseases. Here, using a comparative genomics approach we report general principles of maintaining protein homeostasis across the eukaryotic tree of life. Expanding a previous study of 16 eukaryotes to the quantitative analysis of 216 eukaryotic genomes, we find a strong correlation between the composition of eukaryotic chaperone networks and genome complexity that is distinct for different species kingdoms. Organisms with pronounced phenotypes clearly buck this trend. <i>Northobranchius furzeri</i>, the shortest-lived vertebrate and a widely used model for fragile protein homeostasis, is found to be chaperone limited while <i>Heterocephalus glaber</i> as the longest-lived rodent and thus an especially robust organism is characterized by above-average numbers of chaperones. Strikingly, the relative size of chaperone networks is found to generally correlate with longevity in Metazoa. Our results thus indicate that the balance in protein homeostasis may be a key variable in explaining organismal robustness.</AbstractText>"}

A strong dependence of relative quantum yield on dye doping concentration in the silica-dye-silica nanoparticles was observed. The uniform ∼ 100 nm large silica-dye-silica layered nanoparticles were used to prepare transparent dye doped silica nanoparticle/silicone nanocomposites. Dye doped silica nanoparticle/silicone nanocomposites exhibited higher photostability than the unencapsulated dye samples during long time aging tests under a blue LED with a wavelength of 455 nm at 300 ± 3% mA for 24 h. Novel dye doped layered silica NPs and their nanocomposites offer scope for developing organic luminescent materials into efficient and color-tunable light emitters for low-cost display, lighting, and optical communication applications.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the case in point, a woman reported to the police to be raped five days before by a cousin of hers in his car. The woman declared she had vomited in the car before fainting definitely, due to alcohol or possible drugs covertly slipped in her drinks. The suspect confirmed the sexual intercourse, but he claimed consensual sex while the woman was fully conscious. To establish consent and hence subsistence of the crime, the Magistrate requested toxicological analyses on items sampled from the car and from woman's boots. Negative results obtained from toxicological analyses could not exclude the actual assumption of psychoactive substances by the alleged victim, due to sample aging. On the contrary, proteomic analysis disclosed a pattern of 249 gene products including signature endogenous and food-derived proteins along with a multitude of peptide digests, clearly indicative of vomit, thereby supporting the victim's report in the case under examination. Proteomics also provided detailed information about the nature of meal, which might contribute to frame the crime scene in similar cases. SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of traces of vomit supported the report of the victim's report according to which she vomited before definitely losing consciousness, so providing key contribution to establish consent for the sexual intercourse. This is the first time that proteomics is used to identify traces of vomit for forensic purposes. In spite of the scantiness of the biological specimen available, proteomics was successful to define a panel of characteristic endogenous proteins as well as to identify partly digested food-proteins arising from a complex meal. Proteomics is increasingly used as a forensic technique, well complementing the existing tools. In general, assessing traces of vomit in biological specimens and characterizing the nature of food ingested at the molecular level could afford probative elements to frame a crime scene.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Older people living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) have a significantly higher risk of infection and complications from influenza. Influenza vaccine is considered the best strategy to prevent infection in high-risk populations. In Australia, the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CNDA) suggests a vaccination coverage rate of 95% in both staff and residents<sup>1</sup>. This study aims to measure the vaccination coverage rates for residents in LTCFs and identify predictors of vaccination uptake for these individuals. This study was conducted in nine LTCFs in four sites from March to September 2018. This was done via medical record reviews for residents over 65 years old in these LTCFs, collecting information such as vaccination status, age, gender, ethnicity and occupation. Simple and multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) to determine significant predictors of influenza vaccination uptake. The overall vaccination rate among LTCF residents was 83.6%. Significant predictors of vaccination were LTCF location, ethnicity and previous year vaccination status. Residents in LTCF Site D were less likely to be vaccinated compared to Site A (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.61), non-Caucasians were less likely to get vaccinated (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.67), and residents who refused the 2017 vaccine were less likely to be vaccinated (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.15). Compared with previous Australian studies on LTCF vaccination rates, the overall vaccination rate was high in these LTCFs (83.6% versus 66-84%), but it varied across different sites. Reasons for varying vaccination rates should be explored further - for example, lower rates in non-Caucasians with diverse cultural backgrounds. Better understanding the causes of under-vaccination can help improve vaccination programs in LTCFs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At the microscale, bone quality is related to porosity, microstructural organization, accumulated microdamage and intrinsic material properties. However, the link between these characteristics and fracture behavior is still missing. Bone tissue has a complex structure and as age-related compositional and structural changes occur at all hierarchical length scales it is difficult to experimentally identify and discriminate the effect of each mechanism. The aim of this study was therefore to use computational models to analyze how microscale characteristics in terms of porosity, intrinsic toughness properties and microstructural organization affect the mechanical behavior of cortical bone. Tensile tests were simulated using realistic microstructural geometries based on microscopy images of human cortical bone. Crack propagation was modelled using the extended finite element method where cement lines surrounding osteons were modelled with an interface damage law to capture crack deflections along osteon boundaries. Both increased porosity and impaired material integrity resulted in straighter crack paths with cracks penetrating osteons, similar to what is seen experimentally for old cortical bone. However, only the latter predicted a more brittle failure behavior. Furthermore, the local porosity influenced the crack path more than the macroscopic porosity. In conclusion, age-related changes in cortical bone affect the crack path and the mechanical response. However, increased porosity alone was not driving damage in old bone, but instead impaired tissue integrity was required to capture brittle failure in aging bone.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The common denominator between these two phenomena is the older migrant population, which has been steadily increasing in Northern America and Western Europe. The emergence of this population has been challenging institutional practices and services due to a growth in heterogeneity. Against this background, the paper aims to answer two questions: (1) does super-diversity in the older native population have an impact on the ways in which practitioners regard and refer to older migrants? and (2) what kind of service responses does the recognition of super-diversity as a characteristic of the older population, both native and migrant, lead to? The empirical analysis focuses on Switzerland, a highly relevant case for two reasons: first due to the heterogeneity within the native population, given its three linguistic regions, and second due to the large proportion of (older) migrants. Based on 33 in-depth interviews with representatives of local institutions dealing with older persons including migrants in Switzerland; the conclusion of the paper is that super-diversity in the majority population can potentially lead to a recognition and acceptance of super-diversity in other populations, and in this case older migrants. Yet, at an institutional level super-diversity can translate in over-individualized tailored services, which can unintentionally contribute to inequality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This article aims to expand the social gerontological agenda on civic participation in old age by arguing that migratory life courses offer new angles of investigation. By bringing attention to older migrants' civic participation, this article argues also for the expansion of the imagination of migration scholars who have yet to regard civic participation as an angle of investigation worthy of attention when it comes to this population. Thus, by proposing some of the research questions that could be posed if older migrants' civic participation was to be a part of the research agenda of social gerontologists and migration scholars alike, this article proposes that the ways in which these older people chose to engage civically is one of the ways through which we could bring explicit attention to the contributions that they make to their so called 'host' societies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Through an ethnographic approach, this paper seeks to raise awareness of the diversity within a group of older migrants, given the heterogeneity of affective bonds established with places. By highlighting the perspective of older Italian migrants living in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, this paper illustrates the role of a sense of identification with the context of migration in later life. In referring to migration as a process of transformation, some older Italians re-define their identities, as these become interwoven with the characteristics of the places in which they grow older. However, older migrants' sense of attachment to places also reveals the complexity of aging in the context of migration, when a sense of identification with these is never fully achieved in older age. This paper argues that the notion of aging that these older Italian migrants uphold is not only altered by their experience of migration, but also shaped through their identification with the places they inhabit, given formal and informal practices of identification. Thus, by addressing the determinants for a positive experience of aging in the context of migration, this paper challenges the ways in which older migrant groups are conceptualized in gerontological scholarship.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Distinguishing where the older population lives is important because critics argue that the built environments of their suburban communities make it difficult for them to age in place successfully, that is, to have healthy, independent, active, and enjoyable lives. They point to their low population and building densities, long distances separating their residences from services, amenities, and commercial areas, and few transit and walking options. Consequently, when the mobility limitations of older residents prevent them from safely driving their vehicles, they have difficulties reaching destinations outside their homes (mobility behaviors) to satisfy their discretionary and obligatory needs. This paper questions this suburban bashing. It argues that future cohorts of older people, especially women, will be more able to drive, cars will be technologically safer and easier to operate, and ride-sharing options will be more available. More suburbs will also have mixed-use and pedestrian-accessible built environments reducing the need for vehicular travel. Most importantly, the information, activities, goods, services, and care required by older people to age in place will be delivered to their dwellings. Home sharing, home care, internet connectivity, e-commerce, social media, smart homes, telemedicine and robotic technologies will make the mobility or out-of-home behaviors of older residents less necessary. The paper introduces the constructs of connectivity options and connectivity behaviors to encompass these expanded travel and in-home delivery strategies. These new ways of connecting with their environments will result in more self-reliant older persons who are less constrained by their mobility limitations. These conclusions offer insights for planners and policymakers seeking to make their suburban communities more age-friendly. They must keep pace with the changing ways that older people will access their environments if they are to improve the quality of their lives and help them to age in place successfully.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We report here the first attempt to investigate the association between immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycan patterns, T2DM, and their clinical risk factors in an Australian population. N-glycosylation of proteins is one of the most frequently observed co- and post-translational modifications, reflecting, importantly, the real-time status of the interplay between the genomic and postgenomic factors. In a community-based case-control study, 849 participants (217 cases and 632 controls) were recruited from an urban community in Busselton, Western Australia. We applied the ultraperformance liquid chromatography method to analyze the composition of IgG N-glycans. We then conducted Spearman's correlation analyses to explore the association between glycan biomarker candidates and clinical risk factors. We performed area under the curve (AUC) analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves by fivefold cross-validation for clinical risk factors, IgG glycans, and their combination. Two directly measured and four derived glycan peaks were significantly associated with T2DM, after correction for extensive clinical confounders and false discovery rate, thus suggesting that IgG N-glycan traits are highly correlated with T2DM clinical risk factors. Moreover, adding the IgG glycan profiles to fasting blood glucose in the logistic regression model increased the AUC from 0.799 to 0.859. The AUC for IgG glycans alone was 0.623 with a 95% confidence interval 0.580-0.666. In addition, our study provided new evidence of diversity in T2DM complex trait by IgG N-glycan stratification. Six IgG glycan traits were firmly associated with T2DM, which reflects an increased proinflammatory and biological aging status. In summary, our study reports novel associations between the IgG N-glycome and T2DM in an Australian population and the putative role of proinflammatory mechanisms. Furthermore, IgG N-glycomic alterations offer future prospects as inflammatory biomarker candidates for T2DM diagnosis, and monitoring of T2DM progression to cardiovascular disease or renal failure.</AbstractText>"}

Physical functioning status may be compromised in survivors living in low socioeconomic status environments in comparison to higher socioeconomic status environments. Higher socioeconomic status environments may include benefits in the built environment such as sidewalks, accessible transit, or low traffic volume. Investigation is needed to understand the effects of the socioenvironmental context on trajectories of stroke survivors' physical health-related quality of life (PH-QOL) over time. Methods- Participants from the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study enrolled in the ancillary Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke project completed the SF-12 around 6 to 12, 18, 27, and 36 months poststroke. Measures of area-level income, wealth, education, and employment at the census tract level were combined to represent participants' neighborhood socioeconomic status. Linear mixed models were used to predict trajectories of PH-QOL over time, controlling for individual characteristics. Results- The average trajectory of PH-QOL was flat over time. However, women and younger stroke survivors had better trajectories over time than men and older stroke survivors. Higher neighborhood socioeconomic status was significantly associated with better PH-QOL across all time points (β=1.73; 95% CI, 0.17-3.30), after controlling for demographic variables and severity of stroke. Conclusions- Our findings demonstrate that neighborhood socioeconomic status, sex, and age are associated with the poststroke recovery process. The results of this study suggest the importance of evaluating the environment surrounding stroke survivors when they return to their home communities. Future research should identify specific features of the environment within different socioeconomic status neighborhoods to better understand how they contribute to PH-QOL among stroke survivors.</AbstractText>"}

As a consequence, several self- and partner rating scales for EF have been developed, while rating scales designed for clinicians are lacking. We therefore developed the Executive Checklist (EC-10), a new rating scale for clinicians assessing dysexecutive behavior during neuropsychological assessment and examined its psychometric properties. Consecutive referrals from a memory clinic with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI; <i>n</i> = 27), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; <i>n</i> = 29), dementia (DEM; <i>n</i> = 16), as well as 11 healthy controls were assessed with the EC-10 while performing common neuropsychological tests. Results showed that the EC-10 had excellent inter-rater reliability, good internal consistency and modest relations to cognitive laboratory measures. The EC-10 increased the classification rate above and beyond the influence of neuropsychological tests when comparing patients with SCI and MCI or between cognitively impaired and non-impaired patients. Conclusively, the present study demonstrates that clinical observations can be quantified using the EC-10 and that this rating provides valuable information. As executive deficits are common in many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, validating the EC-10 in broader patient groups should be an important avenue for future research.</AbstractText>"}

It is unclear whether poor childhood socioeconomic status (SES) also predicts the acceleration of cognitive decline. One proposed pathway is via cardiometabolic risk, which has been linked to both childhood SES and earlier onset of cognitive impairment. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examine the impact of childhood SES on cognitive trajectories over six years and test whether it operates through increased cardiometabolic risk and adult SES. We find that higher childhood SES leads to slower cognitive decline, partially due to lower levels of cardiometabolic risk. However, these pathways operate entirely through adult socioeconomic attainment. The results have important implications for future trends in cognitive population health within the context of growing social inequality and reduced social mobility.</AbstractText>"}

Particularly, the Hard Coat film peeled from BDs is optically transparent without any fluorescence background, which can be activated by treating with a common base (1.0 M NaOH) at a slightly elevated temperature (55 °C). The surface density of reactive carboxylic acid groups generated, 6.6 ± 0.7 × 10<sup>-9</sup> mol/cm<sup>2</sup>, is much higher than that on polycarbonate upon UV/ozone irradiation (4.8 ± 0.2 × 10<sup>-10</sup> mol/cm<sup>2</sup>).

Treatment of H<sub>2</sub>S-donor GYY4137 in rat significantly relieved the inhibitory effect of Dex on bone formation. Dex inhibited osteoblasts proliferation and osteogenic differentiation and decreased the expressions of the two H<sub>2</sub>S-generating enzymes. Further investigation showed that H<sub>2</sub>S was involved in Dex-mediated osteoblasts proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

At baseline, there were modest differences in expression of UPR-related genes in young and older adults. Following exercise, transcriptional markers of UPR pathway activation were attenuated in older adults compared to young based on specific salient UPR-related genes and gene set enrichment analysis. The coordination of post-exercise transcriptional patterns between the UPR pathway, p53/p21 axis of autophagy, and satellite cell differentiation were less evident in older compared to young adults.

We found that having a rural residence, not being married, having lower economic status, physical disability, impaired cognitive function, or comorbidity were all associated with an elevated risk of mortality. Using these factors, we computed a weighted 'risk score.' Because never smoking, never drinking, doing physical exercise, having an ideal diet, and a normal weight were independently associated with lower mortality, we also combined them to compute a weighted 'protection score.' Both scores were divided into lowest, middle, and highest groups using their tertiles.

To investigate whether these genes define different SC niches in ginseng, we cloned and analysed five WOX genes in ginseng (PgWOXs) and found that they might regulate root reconstruction. Then, the whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization was used to characterize the 3D gene expression pattern of PgWOXs in ginseng seedlings and cultured adventitious roots. PgWOX4 was expressed in vascular cambium SCs; PgWOX5 and PgWOX11 were mainly expressed in the tips of seedling and adventitious roots, which are the energetic centre of the meristem; and PgWOX13a and PgWOX13b were detected in the parenchyma cells of the main root of seedlings and cultured adventitious roots, suggesting that they are important for maintaining the balance between SC differentiation and self-renewal in the phloem and xylem.

They are commonly used for studying senescence. In this study, we used LC-MS/MS with eight-plex iTRAQ to perform a comparative proteomic analysis of senescence in Daphnia pulex. Of 3076 primordial proteins, 2325 were credible (the remaining were low-confidence proteins) and 247 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Of the latter, 87, 91, and 69 DEPs were identified in the Day 15 vs. Day 5, Day 20 vs. Day 5, and Day 25 vs. Day 5 groups, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that oxidative damage may be the main cause of senescence in D. pulex. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, we found that the peroxisome pathway played an important role in aging. Our results suggest that D. pulex alleviates excessive oxidative damage by altering key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolism.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This ocular disease describes a set of optic neuropathies of which primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common. POAG is associated with progressive visual field deterioration resulting from damage to the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells. Risk factors for POAG include elevated intraocular pressure, aging, African and Hispanic ancestry, and a positive family history of POAG. Multiple genes have been found to contribute to POAG. Much of POAG genetics and pathology has yet to be explained. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of novel loci associated with POAG and its endophenotypes. Genomic and proteomic profiling of biofluids has contributed to our knowledge of differential gene expression in POAG. Functional studies both in cell culture and animal models have confirmed the effects of variants and differential gene expression on ocular physiology while in silico analyses have increased our understanding of disease risk and progression so that we might better diagnose and treat this complex genetic illness.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the association between job demand-control-support combinations and trajectories of disability in later life and to further explore the role of cognitive decline and the co-occurrence of chronic diseases in mediating this association.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS AND FINDINGS'>In this cohort study, 2,937 community dwellers aged 60+ years (mean age 73 ± 10.6; 62.9% female) residing in the Kungsholmen District of Stockholm, Sweden, participated in the baseline survey (2001-2004) and were followed up to 12 years. Lifelong occupational history was obtained through a standardized interview; job demands, job control, and social support at work in the longest-held occupation were graded with a psychosocial job-exposure matrix. Job control, demands, and social support were dichotomized using the median values from the matrix, respectively, to further generate demand-control-support combinations. Disability was measured by summing the number of impaired basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Global cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination. Chronic conditions were ascertained by clinical examinations, medical history, and patient clinical records; the total number of chronic diseases was summed. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and mediation analysis. Age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, leisure activity engagement, early-life socioeconomic status, occupational characteristic and physical demands, and baseline cognitive function and number of chronic diseases were adjusted for in the analyses. Compared with active jobs (high control/high demands; n = 1,807), high strain (low control/high demands; n = 328), low strain (high control/low demands; n = 495), and passive jobs (low control/low demands; n = 307) were all associated with a faster rate of disability progression (β = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.13, p = 0.01; β = 0.10, 95% CI 0.06-0.15, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.18, p &lt; 0.001).

Moreover, we estimated that the association between demand-control status and disability trajectories was mediated 38.5% by cognitive decline and 18.4% by accumulation of chronic diseases during the follow-up period. The limitations of this study include unmeasured confounding, self-reported work experience, and the reliance on a psychosocial job-exposure matrix that does not consider variabilities in individuals' perception on working conditions or job characteristics within occupations.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS'>Our findings suggest that negative psychosocial working conditions during working life may accelerate disability progression in later life. Notably, social support at work may buffer the detrimental effect of high strain on disability progression. Cognitive decline and chronic-disease accumulation, and especially the former, partially mediate the association of psychosocial working conditions with trajectories of disability.

This study evaluated the independent contributions to longevity of favorable and unfavorable early experiences, including psychosocial stressors, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), and close relationships. We also examined 4 midlife psychosocial factors as vulnerability and resilience pathways potentially mediating these associations. The sample included 1,042 men from the VA Normative Aging Study. Early experiences were assessed retrospectively in 1961-1970 and 1995. Midlife psychosocial factors were measured in 1985-1991 and included stressful life events (SLEs), negative affect, life satisfaction, and optimism. Mortality was assessed through 2016. In multiple mediator structural equation models, which account for the overlap among pathways, higher number of SLEs in midlife mediated the association of having more childhood psychosocial stressors to reduced longevity, supporting stress continuity as a vulnerability pathway. Higher optimism in midlife also mediated the association of higher childhood SES to greater longevity. In single mediator models, higher life satisfaction in midlife transmitted the benefits of higher childhood SES and presence of close relationships onto longevity. Higher optimism also mediated the association of fewer childhood psychosocial stressors to longevity. However, these indirect effects were attenuated when accounting for shared variance among mediators, suggesting overlapping pathways. Findings offer novel evidence on unique and shared pathways linking specific dimensions of early experiences to longevity.

An advanced, physician-strength superficial peel, containing 3% retinol with other firming and volumizing ingredients was developed to exfoliate, improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and plump and firm skin, while promoting a bright, even complexion.  Objective: A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of the 3% retinol peel with a supportive homecare regimen across a range of peel candidates, females aged 18-65 years, with photodamage, acne, hyperpigmentation or melasma, and skin of color, over a series of 2-4 peels.  Method: The 3% retinol peel formulation was administered under physician direction in 6-week intervals. Subjects with photodamaged skin, acne, hyperpigmentation/melasma, or skin of color (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI) received 2-4 peels along with a supportive homecare regimen. Dermatologist grading, self-assessment, and digital photography documented tolerability and efficacy parameters.  Results: 24 subjects participated in the study with a total of 78 peels administered (Photodamage group, n=14 [with an Acne subgroup, n=5]; Melasma group, n=5; Skin of Color, n=5). The 3% retinol peel along with the homecare regimen was well tolerated under physician direction in all skin types and conditions assessed.

While treatment of facial aging patterns among white women is well-documented, far less information describes the aesthetic needs of the African American patient.  OBJECTIVE: An online study was conducted to survey facial aesthetic concerns and treatment priorities among US-based population of African American women.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 401 female African American participants ages 30 to 65 years reported their attitudes toward facial aging, current facial conditions, most bothersome facial areas and areas most/least likely to be treated first, awareness of treatment options and their consideration rates, and motives and barriers factoring into consideration of injectable treatments.  RESULTS: Uneven skin tone/color (57%) and dark circles under the eyes (48%) were the most frequently-reported facial concerns. Other common bothersome facial areas affected by signs of aging were the submental area, periorbital area, forehead lines, and chin. Similarly, areas given greater priority with respect to future treatment included the periorbital area, submental area, and forehead lines. With advancing age, priorities heightened for the mid and lower facial areas, which included the nasolabial folds, chin, and oral commissures. Although the majority of participants would consider injectables, cost, and safety/side effects were cited as frequent concerns.  CONCLUSION: For African American women, concerns about facial aging may be less about fine lines and wrinkles caused by increasing skin laxity, and more about pigmentary concerns and shifts in underlying soft tissue volume.

The present study examined the mRNA expression levels of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) family in various types of cancer using the ONCOMINE database, along with their corresponding expression profiles in an array of cancer cell lines based on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets. Kaplan‑Meier plotter survival analysis via the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database was also used to evaluate the prognostic value of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8). For the activity test on the TRPM8 channel, patch‑clamp recordings and Ca2+ measurements by fluorescence imaging of Fluo‑4am were performed. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting TRPM8 was designed, synthesized and then transfected into the U251 cells via Lipofectamine 2000. The expression of extracellular singnal‑regulated kinase (ERK), cyclin D1 and Bcl‑2 were detected by performing western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence. The apoptosis, proliferation and invasion of glioma cells were detected by using flow cytometry, and CCK‑8 and Transwell invasion assays. In the present study, TRPM8 was distinctively upregulated in GBM cell lines. TRPM8 is functional and has the characteristic of outward rectification, which was verified via electrophysiology and Ca2+ fluorescence imaging in U251 cells. The western blot and immunoﬂuorescence results revealed that the expression of ERK, cyclin D1 and Bcl‑2 were decreased in the shRNA interference group. The CCK‑8 assay demonstrated that the proliferation ability of U251 cells in the U251/TRPM8 group was higher than that in the U251 group and U251/Con group (P&lt;0.05). The result of the Transwell invasion assay indicated that the invasion of human glioblastoma U251 cells was positively correlated with the expression level of TRPM8. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that Ca2+‑permeable TRPM8 nonselective cation channels contribute to survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and local tumor invasion of glioblastoma. Therefore, TRPM8 is a promising biomarker for aggressiveness of GBM, and a potential target in future anti‑glioblastoma therapies.</AbstractText>"}

Speculatively, APs might provide physiological benefits for the human brain during developmental/reproductive stages. Of relevance, it is noteworthy that cross-seeding (CS) of APs has recently been characterized in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disease, and that normal physiological CS of multiple APs has also been observed in lower organisms, including yeast and bacteria. In this context, our main objective is to discuss a possible involvement of the CS of APs in promoting evolvability, a hypothetical view regarding the function of APs as an inheritance of acquired characteristics against human brain stressors, which are transgenerationally transmitted to offspring via germ cells. Mechanistically, the protofibrils formed by the CS of multiple APs might confer hormesis more potently than individual APs. By virtue of greater encoded stress information in parental brains being available, the brains of offspring can cope more efficiently with forth-coming stressors. On the other hand, subsequent neurodegeneration caused by APs in parental brain through the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism in aging, may suggest that synergistically, multiple APs might be more detrimental compared to singular AP in neurodegeneration. Taken together, we suggest that the CS of multiple APs might be involved in both evolvability and neurodegenerative disease in human brain, which may be mechanistically and therapeutically important.</AbstractText>"}

The pathological process starts decades before clinical onset, and thus clinical trials of drugs aimed at treating AD should start at a presymptomatic stage. Therefore, it is critical to diagnose AD at an early stage. Tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of Aβ or tau accumulation are supportive biomarkers for AD diagnosis, but there is no reliable presymptomatic diagnostic marker. Since CSF sampling is invasive, and PET imaging is expensive and available only at specialized centers, a reliable blood biomarker has long been sought for. Here we describe a novel extramembrane fragment from solute carrier family 38 member 10 (SLC38A10, S38AA) that we found to be decreased in pyramidal neurons in AD cases by proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis. We detected a S38AA fragment in CSF and found the levels to correlate with severity of AD and APOE genotype. Importantly, the plasma levels of the fragment also showed a significant correlation with Mini-Mental State Examination scores in AD. Moreover, plasma from other neurodegenerative disease was analyzed and the fragment was found to be increased specifically in AD. Interestingly, the fragment is detected in mouse, rat, and monkey, and increases in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice as the AD-like pathology progresses. We propose that the S38AA fragment in plasma could be a novel quantitative diagnostic marker for AD and potentially a marker of disease progression in AD.</AbstractText>"}

In humans, miR-455 is present on the human chromosome 9 at locus 9q32 and encoded by the human COL27A1 gene (collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain). The role of miR-455 has been implicated in various human diseases such as cartilage development, adipogenesis, preeclampsia, and cancers, e.g., colon cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cancer, oral squamous cancer, skin cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Recently, our laboratory discovered the biomarker and therapeutic relevance of miR-455-3p in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our global microarray analysis of serum samples from AD patients, mild cognitive individuals (MCI), and healthy subjects unveiled the high level of miR-455-3p in AD patients relative to MCI and healthy controls. Further, validation analysis using different kinds of AD samples such as serum, postmortem brains, AD fibroblasts, AD B-lymphocytes, AD cell lines, AD mouse models, and AD cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the biomarker potential of miR-455-3p. The mechanistic link of miR-455-3p in AD was determined via modulation of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed AβPP as validated target of miR-455-3p. Our study on mouse neuroblastoma cells revealed the protective role of miR-455-3p against Aβ-induced toxicities. We also noticed that miR-455-3p enhances cell survival and lifespan extension. High level of miR-455-3p reduces Aβ toxicity, enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic activity, and maintains healthy mitochondrial dynamics. Based on these evidences, we cautiously conclude that miR-455-3p is a promising peripheral biomarker and therapeutic candidate for AD.</AbstractText>"}

Most descriptions of senile dementia date back to Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Alzheimer described the first patient, Auguste Deter, who suffered from the disorder that later became known as Alzheimer's disease. Although, the history of the disease before 1906 is quite rich, little has been said about the contributions of ancient and medieval physicians to the understanding of dementia. Over the centuries, the concept of senile dementia changed from an inevitable mental decline with aging, to different sets of clinical features with narrow limits of diagnosis of a disease in its own right. Documentation of the historical origins of prevention, diagnosis, and therapies of dementia would make an important contribution to a more complete understanding of this pathological degeneration of dementia. The present review focuses on the contributions of Avicenna (AD 980-1037) to the development of diagnosis and the discovery of etiology of different forms of dementia, with the goal of revealing the extent to which dementia was understood in the golden age of Islam in Persia.</AbstractText>"}

Destination memory which is defined as the ability to remember to whom we told a piece of information is being found to be compromised in aging. In the present study, we sought to assess destination memory using emotional stimuli (Emotional Destination Memory, EDM) in 16 older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 16 healthy controls and shed light onto its potential neurophysiological aspects. We measured Mu suppression in frontal and temporal regions via EEG in real time while participants performed the task of EDM. Results showed no group differences in task performance but significant differences in fronto-temporal activations, specifically in electrodes F7 and F8. Differential Mu rhythm pattern was observed between healthy controls and MCI with the first exhibiting Mu suppression and the last Mu enhancement. Furthermore, Mu enhancement in temporal electrodes within the MCI group was associated with lower scores on EDM. The absence of group differences in the task can be explained by the fact that even if there are underlying structural or functional deficits in the MCI group, these deficits are manifested only at neurophysiological level and not at a behavioral level, which is a common pattern in the process of cognitive decline in its initial phases. The overall findings reveal that, even if there are not any behavioral decrements in MCI patients, they show reduced activations in fronto-temporal regions and this can be attributed to general impairment in emotional destination memory due to possible mirror neuron deficiency.</AbstractText>"}

We examined baseline (2008-2011) data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, a multicenter, prospective community-based study. Our analyses included 6,110 males and females ≥45 years old who self-reported birth and parents' origin outside of the continental US, Spanish as their first language, and were evaluated in Spanish. Bilingualism was assessed along a Likert scale (1 = only Spanish to 4 = English&gt;Spanish) for language proficiency (reading/spoken) and patterns of use (thinking/socializing). Cognitive testing included verbal learning, memory, fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS). Linear regression models adjusted for relevant confounders, the complex survey design, and sampling weights. Participants' self-reported language proficiency was Spanish better than English, while patterns of use suggested more Spanish than English. Higher language proficiency was associated with higher performance on all cognitive indices while higher patterns of use associated with higher fluency and DSS scores (p-values &lt; 0.01). Female sex was associated with higher performance on all cognitive indices (p-values &lt; 0.05). There were no significant interactions with bilingualism (regardless of metric) by sex on cognition.

Anti-platelet therapy is designed to reduce risk of serious cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, but the adverse consequences of therapy, such as risk for bleeding increases with aging as well. Age-associated comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia also contribute to increased platelet activity and thus can enhance the risk of thrombosis. Therefore, identification of unique mechanisms of platelet dysfunction in aging and in age-associated comorbidities is warranted to design novel antiplatelet drugs.

{"PMID":31523956,"Title":"Chemical Biology Approaches to Interrogate the Selenoproteome.","Journal":"Accounts of chemical research","Date":"Oct 15 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Selenoproteins are the family of proteins that contain the amino acid selenocysteine. Many selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, play a role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. There are a number of examples of homologues of selenoproteins that utilize cysteine residues, raising the question of why selenocysteines are utilized. One hypothesis is that incorporation of selenocysteine protects against irreversible overoxidation, typical of cysteine-containing homologues under high oxidative stress. Studies of selenocysteine function are hampered by challenges both in detection and in recombinant expression of selenoproteins. In fact, about half of the 25 known human selenoproteins remain uncharacterized. Historically, selenoproteins were first detected via labeling with radioactive <sup>75</sup>Se or by use of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to monitor nonradioactive selenium. More recently, tandem mass-spectrometry techniques have been developed to detect selenocysteine-containing peptides. For example, the isotopic distribution of selenium has been used as a unique signature to identify selenium-containing peptides from unenriched proteome samples. Additionally, selenocysteine-containing proteins and peptides were selectively enriched using thiol-reactive electrophiles by exploiting the increased reactivity of selenols relative to thiols, especially under low pH conditions. Importantly, the reactivity-based enrichment of selenoproteins can differentiate between oxidized and reduced selenoproteins, providing insight into the activity state. These mass spectrometry-based selenoprotein detection approaches have enabled (1) production of selenoproteome expression atlases, (2) identification of aging-associated changes in selenoprotein expression, (3) characterization of selenocysteine reactivity across the selenoprotein family, and (4) interrogation of selenoprotein targets of small-molecule drugs. Further investigations of selenoprotein function would benefit from recombinant expression of selenoproteins. However, the endogenous mechanism of selenoprotein production makes recombinant expression challenging. Primarily, selenocysteine is biosynthesized on its own tRNA, is dependent on multiple enzymatic steps, and is highly sensitive to selenium concentrations. Furthermore, selenocysteine is encoded by the stop codon UGA, and suppression of that stop codon requires a selenocysteine insertion sequence element in the selenoprotein mRNA. In order to circumvent the low efficiency of the endogenous machinery, selenoproteins have been produced <i>in vitro</i> through native chemical ligation and expressed protein ligation. Attempts have also been made to engineer the endogenous machinery for increased efficiency, including recoding the selenocysteine codon, and engineering the tRNA and the selenocysteine insertion sequence element. Alternatively, genetic code expansion can be used to generate selenoproteins. This approach allows for selenoprotein production directly within its native cellular environment, while bypassing the endogenous selenocysteine incorporation machinery. Furthermore, by incorporating a caged selenocysteine by genetic code expansion, selenoprotein activity can be spatially and temporally controlled. Genetic code expansion has allowed for the expression and uncaging of human selenoproteins in <i>E. coli</i> and more recently in mammalian cells. Together, advances in selenoprotein detection and expression should enable a better understanding of selenoprotein function and provide insight into the necessity for selenocysteine production.</AbstractText>"}

The original definition was a 'muscle loss' of the appendicular muscle mass in the older people as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In 2010, the definition was altered to be low muscle mass together with low muscle function and this was agreed upon as reported in a number of consensus papers. The Society of Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders supports the recommendations of more recent consensus conferences, i.e. that rapid screening, such as with the SARC-F questionnaire, should be utilized with a formal diagnosis being made by measuring grip strength or chair stand together with DXA estimation of appendicular muscle mass (indexed for height2). Assessments of the utility of ultrasound and creatine dilution techniques are ongoing. Use of ultrasound may not be easily reproducible. Primary sarcopenia is aging associated (mediated) loss of muscle mass. Secondary sarcopenia (or disease-related sarcopenia) has predominantly focused on loss of muscle mass without the emphasis on muscle function. Diseases that can cause muscle wasting (i.e. secondary sarcopenia) include malignant cancer, COPD, heart failure, and renal failure and others. Management of sarcopenia should consist of resistance exercise in combination with a protein intake of 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day. There is insufficient evidence that vitamin D and anabolic steroids are beneficial. These recommendations apply to both primary (age-related) sarcopenia and secondary (disease related) sarcopenia. Secondary sarcopenia also needs appropriate treatment of the underlying disease. It is important that primary care health professionals become aware of and make the diagnosis of age-related and disease-related sarcopenia. It is important to address the risk factors for sarcopenia, particularly low physical activity and sedentary behavior in the general population, using a life-long approach. There is a need for more clinical research into the appropriate measurement for muscle mass and the management of sarcopenia. Accordingly, this position statement provides recommendations on the management of sarcopenia and how to progress the knowledge and recognition of sarcopenia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The participants were 70 community-dwelling older Japanese adults (approximately 70% female). Physical activity types were measured using a triaxial accelerometer and categorized based on intensity as sedentary, light-intensity, and vigorous-intensity. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index assessed subjective sleep quality. Objective sleep parameters were assessed using an actigraph. A series of multi-linear regression models analyzed the statistical relationships. Our findings showed that replacing 30 min of sedentary activity per day with an equal period of light-intensity physical activity significantly influenced sleep quality parameters. However, there was no significant difference in sleep quality when light-intensity activity was replaced with vigorous-intensity activity. Engaging in one activity type means less available time for other types of activity; habitual replacement of sedentary activity with light-intensity physical activity might have long-term benefits on the sleep quality of older people.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Providing caregivers with home safety items and education can facilitate ageing in place for older adults living with dementia. In 2015-2017, we examined barriers and facilitators within 17 policy documents and dementia guidelines of the United States (US) Veterans Health Administration pertinent to implementation of a home safety toolkit (HST) for Veterans living with dementia. The documents were issued from 2000 to 2015. Directed qualitative content analysis of these documents guided by themes from stakeholder interviews revealed two key implementation barriers: a focus on physical rather than cognitive risks when determining medical necessity for home equipment, and a focus on rehabilitation and treatment rather than prevention. Mandates for person-centred care planning, including comprehensive assessment, interdisciplinary collaboration, staff education and a focus on population health in primary care facilitate HST implementation. Content analysis can identify policy-level barriers that slow innovation and facilitators that can increase access to care that support ageing in place.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Gallium-based liquid metals (LMs) are promising candidates for these applications yet are limited by their moderate thermal conductivity, difficulty in surface-spreading, and pump-out issues. Incorporation of metallic particles into the LM can address these problems, but observed alloying processes shift the LM melting point and lead to undesirable formation of additional surface roughness. Here, these problems are addressed by introducing a mixture of tungsten microparticles dispersed within a LM matrix (LM-W) that exhibits two- to threefold enhanced thermal conductivity (62 ± 2.28 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> for gallium and 57 ± 2.08 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> for EGaInSn at a 40% filler volume mixing ratio) and liquid-to-paste transition for better surface application. It is shown that the formation of a nanometer-scale LM oxide in oxygen-rich environments allows highly nonwetting tungsten particles to mix into LMs. Using in situ imaging and particle dipping experimentation within a focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy system, the oxide-assisted mechanism behind this wetting process is revealed. Furthermore, since tungsten does not undergo room-temperature alloying with gallium, it is shown that LM-W remains a chemically stable mixture.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

However, many clinical trials indicated severe ASNase toxicity in patients with solid tumors, with resistant mechanisms not well understood. Here, we took a functional genetic approach and identified SLC1A3 as a novel contributor to ASNase resistance in cancer cells. In combination with ASNase, SLC1A3 inhibition caused cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and myriads of metabolic vulnerabilities in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, nucleotides biosynthesis, energy production, redox homeostasis, and lipid biosynthesis. SLC1A3 is an aspartate and glutamate transporter, mainly expressed in brain tissues, but high expression levels were also observed in some tumor types. Here, we demonstrate that ASNase stimulates aspartate and glutamate consumptions, and their refilling through SLC1A3 promotes cancer cell proliferation. Lastly, in vivo experiments indicated that SLC1A3 expression promoted tumor development and metastasis while negating the suppressive effects of ASNase by fueling aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine metabolisms despite of asparagine shortage. Altogether, our findings identify a novel role for SLC1A3 in ASNase resistance and suggest that restrictive aspartate and glutamate uptake might improve ASNase efficacy with solid tumors.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Conservative treatment methods are necessary to reduce rapidly increasing rates of knee joint surgery. Recommended strategies include weight loss and knee bracing to unload knee joint forces. Although weight loss can be beneficial for joint unloading, knee OA patients often find it difficult to lose weight or exercise due to knee pain, and not all patients are overweight. Uni-compartment offloader braces can redistribute joint forces away from one tibiofemoral (TF) compartment, however, &lt;5% of patients have uni-compartmental TFOA, while isolated patellofemoral or multi-compartmental OA are much more common. By absorbing body weight and assisting the knee extension moment using a spring-loaded hinge, sufficiently powerful knee-extension-assist (KEA) braces could be useful for unloading the whole knee. This paper describes the design of a spring-loaded tri-compartment unloader (TCU) knee brace intended to provide unloading in all three knee compartments while weight-bearing, measures and compares the force output of the TCU against the only published and commercially available KEA brace, and calculates the static unloading capacity of each device. The TCU and KEA braces delivered maximum assistive moments equivalent to reducing body weight by 45 and 6 lbs, respectively. The paper concludes that sufficiently powerful spring-loaded knee braces show promise in a new class of multi-compartment unloader knee orthoses, capable of providing a clinically meaningful unloading effect across all three knee compartments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright (c) 2019 by ASME.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We found that the three health outcomes became more prevalent between 2002 and 2015. They were more common among females than males and were becoming more common among younger age groups. While in 2002, the prevalence of basic multimorbidity overcame 50% from the 70-74 age group upwards, in 2015 it crossed the same threshold in the 65-69 age group. The distribution of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations were stratified by the amount of household wealth. Multiple functional limitations reflected the largest differences between the most and the least affluent groups (5.9-fold in 2014/2015), followed by the measure of complex multimorbidity (2.8-fold in 2014/2015) and basic multimorbidity (1.9-fold) in 2014/2015.While age acted as a levelling factor for the wealth differences in basic multimorbidity, it had no such effect on the two other outcomes.

The prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), the most common form of dementia, has been increasing rapidly and is projected to reach 16 million individuals by the year 2050. Several prevailing myths about the science of dementia are discussed, such as that AD is inevitable and that it is exclusively a genetic disease. The fact is that AD is dependent on a multitude of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that interact with one another. In fact, 4 core drivers represent 90% of what determines disease progression in AD. These are (1) glucose or energy dysregulation, (2) lipid dysregulation, (3) inflammation, and (4) oxidation. Lifestyle change can significantly alter the course of AD.

We present a physiologically relevant high-yield protocol for producing iMGLs from induced pluripotent stem cells. Differentiation is directed with small molecules through primitive erythromyeloid progenitors to re-create microglial ontogeny from yolk sac. The iMGLs express microglial signature genes and respond to ADP with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release distinguishing them from macrophages. Using 16 iPSC lines from healthy donors, AD patients and isogenic controls, we reveal that the APOE4 genotype has a profound impact on several aspects of microglial functionality, whereas PSEN1ΔE9 and APPswe mutations trigger minor alterations. The APOE4 genotype impairs phagocytosis, migration, and metabolic activity of iMGLs but exacerbates their cytokine secretion. This indicates that APOE4 iMGLs are fundamentally unable to mount normal microglial functionality in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Both processes reinforce one another, creating a vicious cycle in which transdifferentiation of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells play a central role. Physiological functioning of vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial medial layer greatly depends on normal endothelial cell behavior. Endothelial or intimal layer cells are the primary sensors of pathological triggers circulating in the blood during, for example, ageing or inflammation, and often can be seen as initiators of this vicious cycle. As such, the search for treatment of arterial media calcification, which until now has been mainly concentrated at the level of the vascular smooth cell, may need to be expanded to intimal layer targets.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Vaccines play an important role in prevention. However, immunosenescence alters the intensity and quality of vaccine responses, thus limiting the impact of recommendations directed after 65 years for vaccination against flu, pneumococci, pertussis, tetanus and zoster. Immunosenescence, aggravated by co-morbidities, varies with age, becoming apparent after 60-65 years and more profound after 85 years. All stages of vaccine responses are affected by immunosenescence, from the innate immunity required to activate these responses to the induction of protective antibody responses and immune memory. Nevertheless, the capacity to develop new responses to primary vaccination is more affected than the ability to respond to recalls, although this is also impaired. Responses to vaccines are differentially altered depending on vaccine and age. Influenza vaccines are modestly immunogenic and several meta-analyses agree an estimate for efficacy of about 50% against virologically-proven flu and 40% against flu-related deaths. The anti-pneumococcal 23-valent non-conjugated vaccine does not induce memory while the 13-valent conjugated one does, but their efficacy are likely to be similar between 70 to 52% before 75 years. A sequential vaccination program with the 13-valent primo-vaccination followed by the 23-valent, recommended in immune-suppressed patients, is currently being studied in France. The waning of immunity to pertussis makes recalls necessary in the elderly who develop good antibody responses. Several research avenues are currently being pursued to try improve the degree of protection conferred by these vaccines in elderly.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 SPLF.

Aside from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study sample and to conduct bivariate comparisons by race and age cohort. Linear regression models were conducted in the subsample of respondents reporting on depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9. Models examine the relationship of bodily pain, injury as a reason for retirement or not re-signing with a team, length of NFL career, sociodemographic characteristics, chronic conditions, and functional limitations to depression. Interaction terms tested whether race and age moderated the effect of bodily pain and functional limitations on depressive symptoms. Bivariate associations revealed no significant differences between younger and older former players in indicators of pain and only slightly higher functional limitations among younger former players. In the multivariate models, pain was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.36; <i>p</i> &lt; .01), net of a range of relevant controls. Adding an index of functional limitations reduced this association by nearly half (β = 0.20; <i>p</i> &lt; .01) and functional limitations was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.40; <i>p</i> &lt; .01). No statistically significant interactions were found. Overall, bodily pain was strongly associated with depressive symptoms. After accounting for the effects of functional limitations, this association was notably reduced. These results may be useful in identifying aging-related physical declines in relatively younger adult men who may be at the greatest risk for depression. They highlight how physical functionality and activity may mitigate the risk of depression, even in the presence of significant bodily pain.</AbstractText>"}

The purpose of this article was to review and experimentally evaluate oxidative stress resistance and resilience concepts in cartilage using glutathione redox homeostasis as an example. This framework may help identify novel approaches for promoting chondrocyte homeostasis during aging and obesity.<b>Materials and Methods</b>: Changes in glutathione content and redox ratio were evaluated in three models of chondrocyte stress: (1) age- and tissue-specific changes in joint tissues of 10 and 30-month old F344BN rats, including <i>ex vivo</i> patella culture experiments to evaluate N-acetylcysteine dependent resistance to interleukin-1beta; (2) effect of different durations and patterns of cyclic compressive loading in bovine cartilage on glutathione stress resistance and resilience pathways; (3) time-dependent changes in GSH:GSSG in primary chondrocytes from wild-type and Sirt3 deficient mice challenged with the pro-oxidant menadione.<b>Results</b>: Glutathione was more abundant in cartilage than meniscus or infrapatellar fat pad, although cartilage was also more susceptible to age-related glutathione oxidation. Glutathione redox homeostasis was sensitive to the duration of compressive loading such that load-induced oxidation required unloaded periods to recover and increase total antioxidant capacity. Exposure to a pro-oxidant stress enhanced stress resistance by increasing glutathione content and GSH:GSSG ratio, especially in Sirt3 deficient cells.

Nucleation and growth of these networks was induced by preprocessing the solution with UV irradiation and subsequent solution aging prior to deposition via blade-coating. This process was adopted for both batch and continuous flow processing. Superior charge carrier (hole) mobilities were observed in samples with nucleated seeds compared to controls with 0% nucleated P3HT and 100% nucleated P3HT.

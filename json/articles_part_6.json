This situation causes significant challenges for employers due to the shrinking and ageing of the workforce. Workplace health promotion, adjusted to the needs and expectations of employees in different age groups, is one of the tools of preventing and minimizing the consequences of this demographic process. In Poland there is a lack of research showing employers' attitudes towards the demographic crisis, health promotion as a way of coping with the implications of ageing or the implementation of health promotion tailored to the specificity of younger and older employees. In addition, there is hardly any information on whether these issues are differentiated by the size and financial situation of enterprises. Therefore, the paper is aimed at filling in these knowledge gaps.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='MATERIAL AND METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>A national representative study of 1000 companies employing ≥50 people was conducted (October-November 2017), in a form of standardized computer-assisted personal interviews.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>There is a low awareness of the discussed demographic process (8% of the enterprises surveyed declare experiencing its consequences).

Although half of the respondents believe in the effectiveness of health promotion in coping with the consequences of the ageing process, in reality the capability of these activities is not harnessed (few companies are interested in the diverse health needs and expectations of employees in different age groups, and in adjusting health promotion activities to these needs and expectations).

NF-κB pathway activation has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Baicalein, one of the major active flavonoids found in <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting NF-κB activity. Herein, we report that Baicalein significantly reduces OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway inflammation, serum IgE levels, mucus production, and collagen deposition around the airway. Additionally, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay showed that Baicalein attenuates the activation of NF-κB, which was mainly reflected by IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, p65 nuclear translocation and downstream iNOS expression. Furthermore, in human epithelial cells, Baicalein blocked TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Our study provides evidence that Baicalein administration alleviates the pathological changes in asthma through inactivating the NF-κB/iNOS pathway. Baicalein might be a promising potential therapy agent for patients with allergic asthma in the future.</AbstractText>"}

After Low-dose Zinc treatment, the levels of tissue Malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly decreased, while tissue antioxidant indices were significantly increased. Meanwhile, the level of NF-κB was significantly lower compared to I/R group, while the levels of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher in Low-dose Zinc+I/R group. <i>In vitro</i>, Low-dose Zinc markedly increased Leydig cell (TM3) cell viability, and relieved testicular oxidative damage via down-regulating ROS.

Using RNA-Seq, methylation, copy number variation (CNV), mutation and clinical follow-up data for GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we performed univariate analysis, multi-cluster analysis, differential analysis of different subtypes of lncRNA and coding genes, weighted gene co-expression network analyses, gene set enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, and lncRNA CNV analyses. Our analyses yielded five lncRNAs closely related to survival and prognosis for GBM. To verify the predictive role of these five lncRNAs on the prognosis of GBM patients, the corresponding RNA-seq data from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas were downloaded and analyzed, and comparable results were obtained. The role of one lncRNA LINC00152 has been observed previously; the others are novel findings.

Aging, as a complex process characterized by senescence, triggers various pathways, such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, metabolism dysfunction, telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated autophagy. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying senescence may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan. Modulating lifestyle risk factors and adopting healthy dietary patterns remain significant tools in delaying the aging process, decreasing age-associated comorbidities and mortality, increasing life expectancy and consequently, preventing the development of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, such a strategy represents the most cost-effective approach, and the quality of life of the subjects may be significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. However, it should be initiated from an early age. Moreover, there is a need for further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention. In the future, it is expected that the pharmacological treatment in cardioprotective management will be necessary, accompanied by equally important lifestyle interventions and adjunctive exercise.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the mechanistic metabolic principles remain poorly understood. In the framework of a multi-organ investigation of age-associated changes of ceramide species, a unique and distinctive change pattern of C<sub>16:0</sub> and C<sub>18:0</sub> ceramide species was detected in aged skeletal muscle. Consistently, the expression of CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA, encoding the ceramide synthases (CerS) with substrate preference for C<sub>16:0</sub> and C<sub>18:0</sub> acyl chains, respectively, was down-regulated in skeletal muscle of aged mice. Similarly, an age-dependent decline of both CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA expression was observed in skeletal muscle biopsies of humans. Moreover, CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA expression was also reduced in muscle biopsies from patients in advanced stage of chronic heart failure (CHF) suffering from muscle wasting and frailty. The possible impact of CerS1 and CerS5 on muscle function was addressed by reversed genetic analysis using CerS1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> and CerS5<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> knockout mice. Skeletal muscle from mice deficient of either CerS1 or CerS5 showed reduced caliber sizes of both slow (type 1) and fast (type 2) muscle fibers, fiber grouping, and fiber switch to type 1 fibers. Moreover, CerS1- and CerS5-deficient mice exhibited reduced twitch and tetanus forces of musculus extensor digitorum longus. The findings of this study link CerS1 and CerS5 to histopathological changes and functional impairment of skeletal muscle in mice that might also play a functional role for the aging skeletal muscle and for age-related muscle wasting disorders in humans.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Inhibitors of the cystine-glutamate antiporter subunit xCT, which mediates the uptake of extracellular cystine and thereby promotes GSH synthesis, are thus potential anticancer agents. However, the efficacy of xCT-targeted therapy has been found to be diminished by metabolic reprogramming that affects redox status in cancer cells. Identification of drugs for combination with xCT inhibitors that are able to overcome resistance to xCT-targeted therapy might thus provide the basis for effective cancer treatment. We have now identified the vasodilator oxyfedrine (OXY) as a sensitizer of cancer cells to GSH-depleting agents including the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine (SSZ). Oxyfedrine contains a structural motif required for covalent inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes, and combined treatment with OXY and SSZ was found to induce accumulation of the cytotoxic aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal and cell death in SSZ-resistant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis of tumor xenograft tissue showed cyclooxygenase-2 expression as a potential biomarker for the efficacy of such combination therapy. Furthermore, OXY-mediated ALDH inhibition was found to sensitize cancer cells to GSH depletion induced by radiation therapy in vitro. Our findings thus establish a rationale for repurposing of OXY as a sensitizing drug for cancer treatment with agents that induce GSH depletion.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

To further assess the role of rare coding variation in ataxic disorders, we reanalyzed our previously published exome cohort of 76 predominantly adult and sporadic-onset patients, expanded the total number of cases to 260, and introduced analyses for copy number variation and repeat expansion in a representative subset. For new cases (n = 184), our resulting clinically relevant detection rate remained stable at 47% with 24% classified as pathogenic. Reanalysis of the previously sequenced 76 patients modestly improved the pathogenic rate by 7%. For the combined cohort (n = 260), the total observed clinical detection rate was 52% with 25% classified as pathogenic. Published studies of similar neurological phenotypes report comparable rates. This consistency across multiple cohorts suggests that, despite continued technical and analytical advancements, an approximately 50% diagnostic rate marks a relative ceiling for current WES-based methods and a more comprehensive genome-wide assessment is needed to identify the missing causative genetic etiologies for cerebellar ataxia and related neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The objectives of this study were to elucidate the temporal expression of tendon-related genes during the formation of artificial tendons in vitro and to investigate if early growth response-1 (EGR1), EGR2, FOS, and cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (PTGS1 and PTGS2) are sensitive to mechanical loading. First, we studied messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of several tendon-related genes during formation of tendon constructs. Second, we studied the mRNA levels of, for example, EGR1 and EGR2 after different degrees of loading; dynamic physiologic-range loading (2.5% strain), dynamic overloading (approximately 10% strain), or tension release. The gene expression for tendon-related genes (i.e., EGR2, MKX, TNMD, COL3A1) increased with time after seeding into this 3D model. EGR1, EGR2, FOS, PTGS1, and PTGS2 did not respond to physiologic-range loading. But overloading (and tension release) lead to elevated levels of EGR1 and EGR2 (p ≤ 0.006). FOS and PTGS2 were increased after overloading (both p &lt; 0.007) but not after tension release (p = 0.06 and 0.08). In conclusion, the expression of tendon-related genes increases during the formation of artificial tendons in vitro, including EGR2. Furthermore, the gene expression of EGR1 and EGR2 in human tendon cells appear to be sensitive to overloading and unloading but did not respond to the single episode of physiologic-range loading.

The volume of blood required has also decreased, from around tens of millilitres to a single finger-prick drop. Besides, while early studies were limited to reprogramming methods relying on viral integration, nonintegrating reprogramming systems for blood lineages have been subsequently established.

Genetic analysis showed the presence of the common mutation of NEMO (exon 4-10 deletion), Klinefelter syndrome karyotype (47 XXY), and random X inactivation. This is in accordance with the severity of involvement of the affected tissues (skin, central nervous system, and retina). Indeed, the patient developed typical skin lesions all over the body, except the head. Equally, multiple lesions diffusely involving both the cortical grey matter and subcortical white matter of the cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres were observed. Discussing current knowledge about the etiopathogenesis of skin and brain lesions in incontinentia pigmenti, our case seems to support the proapoptotic origin of central nervous system involvement. Possibly, incontinentia pigmenti patients suffer an impaired protection against apoptosis at the level of cerebral endothelial cells of small vessels, leading to vascular damage and subsequent ischemic brain lesions.</AbstractText>"}

Therapeutics that modulate such neuroinflammatory responses in the aging brain have the potential to reduce neurological dysfunction and promote recovery. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are lipid-bound, nanoscale vesicles that can modulate inflammation and enhance recovery in rodent stroke models. We recently assessed the efficacy of intravenous infusions of MSC-EVs (24-h and 14-days post-injury) as a treatment in aged rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with cortical injury that induced impairment of fine motor function of the hand. Aged monkeys treated with EVs after injury recovered motor function more rapidly and more fully than aged monkeys given a vehicle control. Here, we describe EV-mediated inflammatory changes using histological assays to quantify differences in markers of neuroinflammation in brain tissue between EV and vehicle-treated aged monkeys. The activation status of microglia, the innate macrophages of the brain, is critical to cell fate after injury. Our findings demonstrate that EV treatment after injury is associated with greater densities of ramified, homeostatic microglia, along with reduced pro-inflammatory microglial markers. These findings are consistent with a phenotypic switch of inflammatory hypertrophic microglia towards anti-inflammatory, homeostatic functions, which was correlated with enhanced functional recovery. Overall, our data suggest that EVs reduce neuroinflammation and shift microglia towards restorative functions. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs for reducing neuroinflammation after cortical injury in the aged brain.</AbstractText>"}

Among these changes that affect refraction, reshaping of corneal curvature is the principle one. Contrary to the expectations, and in contrast to changes associated with cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery led to decrease in vertical corneal radius (steepening) and development of the with-the-rule astigmatism. A number of studies helped reveal the features of corneal astigmatism that appears after glaucoma surgery: its power, duration, possibility of horizontal meridian flattening, influence of topical cytostatic drugs and drainage devices, etc. Potential reasons of astigmatism development were suggested: conjunctival incisions and sutures in the limbal area, quantity and strength of flap sutures, intraocular pressure level, shift of fistula edges, tissue contraction after cauterization, etc. The key role in pathogenesis of the refractive shift due to change of corneal curvature may belong to particularities of wound healing in the cornea and sclera: healing in sclera is similar to one of connective tissue - its ultrastructure undergoes aging process followed by change of rigidity. At the same time, the main reason for the development of corneal astigmatism after glaucoma surgery remains unclear.</AbstractText>"}

Due to incapacity to form new white adipocytes, adipose expansion in aged mice primarily depends on adipocyte hypertrophy, which induces metabolic dysfunction. On the other hand, brown adipose tissue burns fatty acids, preventing ectopic lipid accumulation and metabolic diseases. However, the capacity of brown/beige adipogenesis declines inevitably during the aging process. Previously, we reported that DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter is required for beige adipogenesis. DNA methylation is mediated by ten-eleven family proteins (TET) using alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) as a cofactor. Here, we demonstrated that the circulatory AKG concentration was reduced in middle-aged mice (10-month-old) compared with young mice (2-month-old). Through AKG administration replenishing the AKG pool, aged mice were associated with the lower body weight gain and fat mass, and improved glucose tolerance after challenged with high-fat diet (HFD). These metabolic changes are accompanied by increased expression of brown adipose genes and proteins in inguinal adipose tissue. Cold-induced brown/beige adipogenesis was impeded in HFD mice, whereas AKG rescued the impairment of beige adipocyte functionality in middle-aged mice. Besides, AKG administration up-regulated Prdm16 expression, which was correlated with an increase of DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter. In summary, AKG supplementation promotes beige adipogenesis and alleviates HFD-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, which is associated with enhanced DNA demethylation of the Prdm16 gene.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Exposure to toxic particles and gases, including cigarette smoke, is the main risk factor for COPD. Together with smoking cessation, current treatment strategies of COPD aim to improve symptoms and prevent exacerbations, but there is no disease-modifying treatment. The biggest drawback of today's COPD treatment regimen is the 'one size fits all' pharmacological intervention, mainly based on disease severity and symptoms and not the individual's disease pathology. To halt the worrying increase in the burden of COPD, disease management needs to be advanced with a focus on personalized treatment. The main pathological feature of COPD includes a chronic and abnormal inflammatory response within the lungs, which results in airway and alveolar changes in the lung as reflected by (small) airways disease and emphysema. Here we discuss recent developments related to the abnormal inflammatory response, ECM and age-related changes, structural changes in the small airways and the role of sex-related differences, which are all relevant to explain the individual differences in the disease pathology of COPD and improve disease endotyping.

The VGVAPG peptide simultaneously decreases the release of IL-1β into the cell-culture medium from astrocytes. The ELISA method revealed that the VGVAPG peptide increases the protein expression of SOD1 whereas it decreases the expression of IL-1βR1, CAT, and NF-κB. Therefore, the available data suggest that the VGVAPG peptide (concentration 10 nM) synergistically acts with agonists of PPARγ in mouse astrocytes. However, given the lack of sufficient data to explain the molecular mechanism of action of the VGVAPG peptide in the nervous system, more studies in this area are necessary.</AbstractText>"}

White matter abnormalities have emerged as a key component of age-related neurodegeneration, and accumulating evidence suggests they play a role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Viral persistence in the brain induces chronic inflammation associated with lymphocytic infiltration, microglial proliferation, myelin loss, and cerebrovascular lesions. In this study, gene expression profiling was performed on frontal white matter from 34 older HIV+ individuals on HAART (18 with NCI) and 24 HIV-negative controls. We used the NanoString nCounter platform to evaluate 933 probes targeting inflammation, interferon and stress responses, energy metabolism, and central nervous system-related genes. Viral loads were measured using single-copy assays. Compared to HIV- controls, HIV+ individuals exhibited increased expression of genes related to interferon, MHC-1, and stress responses, myeloid cells, and T cells and decreased expression of genes associated with oligodendrocytes and energy metabolism in white matter. These findings correlated with increased white matter inflammation and myelin pallor, suggesting interferon (IRFs, IFITM1, ISG15, MX1, OAS3) and stress response (ATF4, XBP1, CHOP, CASP1, WARS) gene expression changes are associated with decreased energy metabolism (SREBF1, SREBF2, PARK2, TXNIP) and oligodendrocyte myelin production (MAG, MOG), leading to white matter dysfunction. Machine learning identified a 15-gene signature predictive of HIV status that was validated in an independent cohort. No specific gene expression patterns were associated with NCI. These findings suggest therapies that decrease chronic inflammation while protecting mitochondrial function may help to preserve white matter integrity in older HIV+ individuals.</AbstractText>"}

It is hypothesized that in addition to decreased cardiac output, increases in central-and consequentially, cerebral-venous pressure (backward failure) also contribute significantly to the genesis of cognitive impairment. To test this hypothesis and elucidate the specific pathogenic role of venous congestion in the brain, we have established a novel model of increased cerebral venous pressure: mice with jugular vein ligation (JVL). To test the hypothesis that increased venous pressure in the brain contributes to the development of cognitive deficits by causing blood-brain barrier disruption, dysregulation of blood flow, and/or promoting neuroinflammation, in C57BL/6 mice, the internal and external jugular veins were ligated. Cognitive function (radial arm water maze), gait function (CatWalk), and motor coordination (rotarod) were tested post-JVL. Neurovascular coupling responses were assessed by measuring changes in cerebral blood flow in the whisker barrel cortex in response to contralateral whisker stimulation by laser speckle contrast imaging through a closed cranial window. Blood-brain barrier integrity (IgG extravasation) and microglia activation (Iba1 staining) were assessed in brain slices by immunohistochemistry. Neuroinflammation-related gene expression profile was assessed by a targeted qPCR array. After jugular vein ligation, mice exhibited impaired spatial learning and memory, altered motor coordination, and impaired gait function, mimicking important aspects of altered brain function observed in human heart failure patients. JVL did not alter neurovascular coupling responses. In the brains of mice with JVL, significant extravasation of IgG was detected, indicating blood-brain barrier disruption, which was associated with histological markers of neuroinflammation (increased presence of activated microglia) and a pro-inflammatory shift in gene expression profile. Thus, cerebral venous congestion per se can cause blood-brain barrier disruption and neuroinflammation, which likely contribute to the genesis of cognitive impairment. These findings have relevance to the pathogenesis of cognitive decline associated with heart failure as well as increased cerebal venous pressure due to increased jugular venous reflux in elderly human patients.</AbstractText>"}

Aging increases activation of the innate immune system, and macrophage numbers increase in the aged liver. Since macrophages also produce free radical molecules, they are a potential source of age-related oxidative injury in the liver. This study evaluated macrophage phenotype in the aged liver and whether the increase in the number of macrophages with aging is associated with enhanced hepatic oxidative stress. Hepatic macrophage phenotype and oxidative stress were evaluated 2 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of saline or gadolinium chloride (GdCl<sub>3</sub>, 10 mg/kg) in young (6 months) and aged (24 months) Fischer 344 rats. GdCl<sub>3</sub> has been shown to decrease the expression of macrophage-specific markers and impair macrophage phagocytosis in the liver. Saline-treated aged rats demonstrated greater numbers of both M1 (HO-1<sup>+</sup>/iNOS<sup>+</sup>) and M2 (HO-1<sup>+</sup>/CD163<sup>+</sup>) macrophages, without evidence of a phenotypic shift. GdCl<sub>3</sub> did not alter levels of dihydroethidium fluorescence or malondialdehyde, suggesting that macrophages are not a major contributor to steady-state levels of oxidative stress. However, GdCl<sub>3</sub> decreased M1 and M2 macrophage markers in both age groups, an effect that was attenuated in aged rats. In old animals, GdCl<sub>3</sub> decreased iNOS expression to a greater extent than HO-1 or CD163. These results suggest a novel effect of aging on macrophage biology and that GdCl<sub>3</sub> shifts hepatic macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype in aged animals.</AbstractText>"}

Less is known on the impact of lower visual field obstruction and the weight of the anterior load on obstacle negotiation and attention demand. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if carrying a weighted anterior load, lower visual field occlusion, or both, modify obstacle clearance and/or reaction time (RT); and (2) examine whether RT is modulated across obstacle crossing phases as measured by a probe RT protocol. Sixteen young adults crossed an obstacle while carrying no load, a clear 5 kg load, and an opaque 5 kg load, while performing a simple RT task. Auditory stimuli were presented at five locations: (1) two steps before the obstacle; (2) one step before the obstacle; (3) as the leading limb crossed the obstacle; (4) as the lead limb touched down after the obstacle; and (5) as the trail limb crossed the obstacle. The toe clearance height of the leading limb was greatest for the weighted opaque box load type followed by the weighted clear box type compared to the no box load type. Carrying an anterior load during obstacle crossing did not influence RT. RTs were longer at the pre-crossing and beginning of the crossing phases compared to after-crossing phases. Results suggest that carrying a weighted anterior load and lower visual field occlusion increase the risk for tripping. Attention demands differ across obstacle crossing phases during dual-tasking and should be considered in fall-risk assessments.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we show that Atm reactivation in initially Atm-deficient B- and T cell lymphomas induces tumor regression. We further find a reduced T cell abundance in B cell lymphomas from Atm-defective mice and A-T patients. Using T cell-specific Atm-knockout models, as well as allogeneic transplantation experiments, we pinpoint impaired immune surveillance as a contributor to cancer predisposition and development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Atm-deficient T cells display impaired proliferation capacity upon stimulation, due to replication stress. Altogether, our data indicate that T cell-specific restoration of ATM activity or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may prevent lymphomagenesis in A-T patients.</AbstractText>"}

In this study linear regression models were used to disentangle distinctive DMN activity patterns that are more profoundly associated with either normal ageing or a structural marker of neurodegeneration. 312 datasets inclusive of healthy adults and patients were analysed. Days of life at scan (DOL) and hippocampal volume were used as predictors. Group comparisons confirmed a significant association between functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and precuneus and both ageing and AD. Fully-corrected regression models revealed that DOL significantly predicted DMN strength in these regions. No such effect, however, was predicted by hippocampal volume. A significant positive association was found between hippocampal volumes and DMN connectivity in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results indicate that postero-medial DMN down-regulation may not be specific to neurodegenerative processes but may be more an indication of brain vulnerability to degeneration. The DMN-TPJ disconnection is instead linked to the volumetric properties of the hippocampus, may reflect early-stage regional accumulation of pathology and might be of aid in the clinical detection of abnormal ageing.</AbstractText>"}

Upon valvular damage at larval stages, the intracardiac flow pattern becomes reminiscent of the early embryonic stages, exhibiting an increase in the retrograde flow fraction through the atrioventricular canal. As a result of the altered hemodynamics, notch1b and klf2a expression are ectopically upregulated, adopting the expression pattern of earlier developmental stages.

The calpain inhibitor calpeptin suppressed hyperthermia-induced degradation or the appearance of A23187-induced cleaved form of STK38. An in vitro cleavage assay was then used to demonstrate that calpain I directly cleaves STK38 at the proximal N-terminal region. Deletion of the N-terminal region of STK38 increased its stability against hyperthermia. We further demonstrated that the MAPKK kinase (MAP3K) MEKK2 prevented both heat- and calpain-induced cleavage of STK38. MEKK2 knockdown enhanced hyperthermia-induced degradation of STK38. We performed an in vitro MEKK2 assay and identified the key regulatory site in STK38 phosphorylated by MEKK2. Experiments with a phosphorylation-defective mutant demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser 91 is important for STK38 stability, as the enzyme is susceptible to degradation by the calpain pathway unless this residue is phosphorylated.

Moreover, pyrophosphate synthesis from ATP was reduced and pyrophosphate hydrolysis (via TNAP; pyrophosphate → phosphate) was increased in both aortas and blood obtained from mice with HGPS. The reduced production of pyrophosphate, together with the reduction in plasma ATP, resulted in marked reduction of plasma pyrophosphate.

During level and uphill walking, both age groups showed comparable ankle moment-induced ipsilateral (p = 0.774) and contralateral (p = 0.047) hip accelerations, although older adults generated lower ankle moments in late stance. However, ankle moment-induced contralateral hip accelerations were smaller (p = 0.001) in an older adult subgroup (n = 13) who showed larger hip extension moments in early stance than young adults. During level and downhill walking, leg joint moment-induced knee accelerations were unaffected by age (all p &gt; 0.05). These findings suggest that during level and uphill walking increased hip flexor mechanical output in older adults does not arise from reduced ankle moments, contrary to increased hip extensor mechanical output. Additionally, results during level and downhill walking imply that preserved eccentric knee extensor function is important in maintaining knee stabilization in older age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aim to determine trends in discharge to care homes, to explore the characteristics of stroke survivors over time (1995-2018), and to identify the associations between these characteristics and discharge to care homes poststroke. Methods- Using data from the South London Stroke Register between 1995 and 2018, we estimated the proportions discharged to care homes and their characteristics over time, assessed by tests for trends. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to assess the associations between their characteristics and discharge destination. Results- Of 4172 stroke survivors, 484 (12%) were discharged to care homes. This proportion has decreased from 24% in 1995 to 2000 to 5% in 2013 to 2018. The mean age of those discharged to care homes has increased over time, from 73 to 75 (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Among stroke survivors discharged to a care home, the proportion with a prestroke Barthel Index &lt;15 has also increased over time from 7% to 21% (<i>P</i>=0.027), while the proportion with a 7-day poststroke Barthel Index &lt;15 remains largely unchanged over time (93% in 1995-2000, 90% in 2013-2018). The characteristics most strongly associated with discharge to care homes were (odds ratio [95% CI]) age (1.05 [1.04-1.07] per year), stroke subtype (hemorrhagic; 0.64 [0.43-0.95]), stroke severity (Glasgow Coma Scale score, &lt;13; 1.67 [1.19-2.35]), failed swallow test at admission (1.65 [1.20-2.25]), 7-day poststroke Barthel Index &lt;15 (3.58 [2.20-6.03]), and a longer hospital stay (1.02 [1.02-1.03] per day). Conclusions- Over &gt;20 years, there has been an 80% reduction in the proportion of stroke survivors discharged to care homes, influenced by changes in the demographics, disability, and stroke care in the underlying stroke population. In those moving to care homes, the level of poststroke disability remains high, requiring continued attention and investment.</AbstractText>"}

Spinal pathologies such as idiopathic back pain, vertebral compression fractures and IVD failure affect millions of people worldwide. Animal models can help us to understand the disease process, and zebrafish are increasingly used as they are highly genetically tractable, their spines are axially loaded like humans, and they show similar pathologies to humans during ageing. However, biomechanical models for the zebrafish are largely lacking. Here, we describe the results of loading intact zebrafish spinal motion segments on a material testing stage within a micro-computed tomography machine. We show that vertebrae and their arches show predictable patterns of deformation prior to their ultimate failure, in a pattern dependent on their position within the segment. We further show using geometric morphometrics which regions of the vertebra deform the most during loading, and that finite-element models of the trunk subjected reflect the real patterns of deformation and strain seen during loading and can therefore be used as a predictive model for biomechanical performance.</AbstractText>"}

It is widely accepted that autophagic dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders; however, the role of heavy metals in regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy is unclear. Here, we show that manganese (Mn) induces a decline in nuclear localization of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, leading to autophagic dysfunction in astrocytes of mouse striatum. We further show that Mn exposure suppresses autophagic-lysosomal degradation of mitochondria and induces accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria. Activation of autophagy by rapamycin or TFEB overexpression ameliorates Mn-induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in astrocytes, suggesting a causal relation between autophagic failure and mitochondrial dysfunction in Mn toxicity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Mn inhibits TFEB activity, leading to impaired autophagy that is causally related to mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for Mn in dysregulation of autophagy and identify TFEB as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate Mn toxicity.<b>Abbreviations:</b> BECN1: beclin 1; CTSD: cathepsin D; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; GFAP: glial fibrillary acid protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HBSS: hanks balanced salt solution; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; Lys Inh: lysosomal inhibitors; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; Mn: manganese; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PFA: paraformaldehyde; PI: propidium iodide; ROS: reactive oxygen species; s.c.: subcutaneous; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TFEB: transcription factor EB.</AbstractText>"}

The constructed models predict the chronological age with good performance (mean absolute error of 5.11 years on average) and show better performance in the independent test than previous multi-tissue age predictors. We also compared tissue-common and tissue-specific aging markers and found that they had different characteristics. Firstly, the tissue-common group tended to contain more positive aging markers with methylation values that increased during the aging process, whereas the tissue-specific group tended to contain more negative aging markers. Secondly, many of the tissue-common markers were located in Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) island regions, whereas the tissue-specific markers were located in CpG shore regions. Lastly, the tissue-common CpG markers tended to be located in more evolutionarily conserved regions.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of the composite subjected to 20% thickness reduction of cold rolling at room temperature and their evolutions upon post-aging at different temperatures were investigated by means of a tensile test, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the TiB<sub>2</sub> particles were effective in dislocation pinning and accumulation during the cold-rolling process. The tensile tests indicated that both the yield and ultimate tensile strengths of the cold-rolling sample increased a lot due to the dislocation strengthening and precipitation strengthening generated by dynamic precipitation during cold rolling in comparison with the conventional T6 sample. After aging at 100 °C/12 h, the elongation to failure reached ~8.4%, which was higher than the conventional T6 sample. Meanwhile, there was also a dramatic increase of strength. The yield and ultimate tensile strengths are ~644 MPa and ~726 MPa, respectively. This remarkable strength-ductility combination was due to the modified microstructure caused prior to artificial aging by the cold-rolling method and the formation of nanosized Guinier-Preston-Bagaryatsky (GPB) zones. The underlying mechanisms related to the superior strength-ductility combination were discussed regarding the microstructural characteristics in the composite.</AbstractText>"}

The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were calculated for each anthropometric indicator, using the prediabetes classification to identify their sensitivity and specificity, and these indicated that the prevalence of prediabetes was 25.3% in this population. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the TyG index was strongly associated with the odds of having prediabetes in both sexes, and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the ORs for prediabetes increased across quartiles (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The TyG index was best able to identify prediabetes in either sex (AUC and optimal cut-off = 0.700 and 8.72, and 0.695 and 8.92 for men and women, respectively), suggesting that compared to the other parameters, the TyG index has the best discriminative power to predict prediabetes in the whole population. Thus, we propose the TyG index be used as a complementary marker for assessing prediabetes in older adults.</AbstractText>"}

Despite the abundant literature on this topic, the effect of the polymorphism and pseudo-polymorphism of lactose has been seldom investigated and discussed although often lactose used in DPI is subjected to unit operations, which may alter its solid-state properties. Here, we studied the aerosolization performance of salbutamol sulphate (SS) or budesonide (BUD) formulations by investigating the effect of lactose pseudopolymorphism in ternary (coarse lactose/fine lactose/drug) and binary (coarse lactose/drug) mixtures. An improvement of the aerosolization performance of SS formulations with the increase of the amount of fine micronized lactose up to 30% (fine particle fraction (FPF) = 57%) was observed. Micronized lactose contained hygroscopic anhydrous α-lactose, which converted to α-lactose monohydrate at ambient conditions. This implied that the positive effect of fines on the aerosolization performance decreased and eventually disappeared with the formulation aging. Positive effect on SS deposition was observed also with binary mixtures with anhydrous lactose, whereas the opposite occurred with budesonide-containing formulations. The collected data demonstrated the crucial role of the carrier crystal form on the positive effect of fines on the deposition.</AbstractText>"}

For example, in AgriTalk, a smart farm platform for soil cultivation with a large number of sensors, the produced sensor data are used in several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide precise farming for soil microbiome and fertility, disease regulation, irrigation regulation, and pest regulation. It is important that the sensor data are correctly used in AI modeling. Unfortunately, no sensor is perfect. Even for the sensors manufactured from the same factory, they may yield different readings. This paper proposes a solution called SensorTalk to automatically detect potential sensor failures and calibrate the aging sensors semi-automatically. Numerical examples are given to show the calibration tables for temperature and humidity sensors. When the sensors control the actuators, the SensorTalk solution can also detect whether a failure occurs within a detection delay. Both analytic and simulation models are proposed to appropriately select the detection delay so that, when a potential failure occurs, it is detected reasonably early without incurring too many false alarms. Specifically, our selection can limit the false detection probability to be less than 0.7%.</AbstractText>"}

Data stem from the German Ageing Survey (10,324 respondents). The use of preventive health services was assessed by asking for regular use of flu vaccination and cancer screening in the past years. Predictors of interest were structural (having a partner, size of the social network) and functional aspects of social relationships (perceived informational support) and age. Logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between preventive health services use and these predictors. Self-perceived health, gender and education were considered as covariates. Having a partner (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.34) and perceived informational support (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.13-1.69) were associated with a higher probability of getting flu vaccination regularly over the past years. Informational support (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.17-1.72) and having a partner (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.41-1.75) were positively associated with regular cancer screening over the past years. Associations between the size of the social network and use of preventive health services were not statistically significant. Associations between the use of preventive health services and social relationships varied by age. Structural and functional aspects of social relationships may support preventive health behavior. To increase preventive health behavior and the use of preventive health services, it is necessary to integrate information on social relationships into routine care and to strengthen sources of social support.</AbstractText>"}

These networks contribute to the promotion of age-associated cardiovascular diseases of oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, their inhibition delays the onset of these cardiovascular diseases as well as senescence and aging. In this review we focus on whether the (a) ASK1-signalosome, a major center of distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated stress signals, plays a role in the promotion of cardiovascular diseases of oxidative stress and inflammation; (b) The ASK1-signalosome links ROS signals generated by dysfunctional mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes to the p38 MAPK stress response pathway; (c) the pathway contributes to the sensitivity and vulnerability of aged tissues to diseases of oxidative stress; and (d) the importance of inhibitors of these pathways to the development of cardioprotection and pharmaceutical interventions. We propose that the ASK1-signalosome regulates the progression of cardiovascular diseases. The resultant attenuation of the physiological characteristics of cardiomyopathies and aging by inhibition of the ASK1-signalosome network lends support to this conclusion. Importantly the ROS-mediated activation of the ASK1-signalosome p38 MAPK pathway suggests it is a major center of dissemination of the ROS signals that promote senescence, aging and cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacological intervention is, therefore, feasible through the continued identification of potent, non-toxic small molecule inhibitors of either ASK1 or p38 MAPK activity. This is a fruitful future approach to the attenuation of physiological aspects of mammalian cardiomyopathies and aging.</AbstractText>"}

They are evolutionary conserved molecules, and although detected in different tissues, circRNAs resulted specifically enriched in the nervous system. Recent studies have shown that circRNAs are dynamically modulated during neuronal development and aging, that circRNAs are enriched at synaptic levels and resulted modulated after synaptic plasticity induction. This has suggested that circRNAs might play an important role in neuronal specification and activity. Despite the exact function of circRNAs is still poorly understood, emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs have important regulatory functions that might extensively contribute to the dynamic modulation of gene expression that supports neuronal pathways. More interestingly, deregulation of circRNAs expression has been linked with various pathological conditions. In this review, we describe current advances in the field of circRNA biogenesis and function in the nervous system both in physiological and in pathological conditions, and we specifically lay out their association with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunity to exploit circRNAs for innovative therapeutic approaches and, due to their high stability, to use circRNAs as suitable biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression.</AbstractText>"}

However, driving during non-hypoglycemia may also bring certain safety hazards for some patients with diabetes. Based on previous studies on diabetes-related to early aging effect, as well as gender differences in health belief and driving behavior, we have hypothesized that middle-aged male drivers with type 2 diabetes, compared with the control healthy ones, may experience a decline in driving performance without awareness. And the decline is caused by impaired perceptual and cognitive driving-related functions. To verify these hypotheses, we recruited 56 non-professional male drivers aged between 40 and 60 (27 patients with type 2 diabetes and 29 healthy controls) to perform a simulated car-following task and finish behavioral tests of proprioception, visual search, and working memory abilities during non-hypoglycemia. They also reported their hypoglycemia experience and perceived driving skills. We found that the patients had equal confidence in their driving skills but worse driving performance as shown in larger centerline deviation (t = 2.83, p = .006), longer brake reaction time (t = 3.77, p = .001) and shorter minimum time-to-collision (t = -3.27, p = .002). Such between-group differences in driving performance could be fully mediated by proprioception, visual search ability, and working memory capacity but not by hypoglycemia experience. Regarding the effect sizes of the mediation, the visual search ability played the most important role, and then followed the working memory and the proprioception. This initial study provides original and first-hand evidence demonstrating that the middle-aged male drivers with type 2 diabetes have deteriorated driving performance, but they are unaware of it. We will also discuss the possible measures to identify people of the highest risk and improve their safety awareness by using the findings of the current study.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

On the one hand, indirect evidence implicates that astrocytic release of PGE<sub>2</sub> contributes to neurovascular coupling responses mediating functional hyperemia in the brain. On the other hand, overproduction of PGE<sub>2</sub> was also reported to contribute to cerebral vasospasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The present study was conducted to resolve this controversy by determining the direct vasoactive effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> in resistance-sized human cerebral parenchymal arterioles. To achieve this goal PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced isotonic vasomotor responses were assessed in parenchymal arterioles isolated from fronto-temporo-parietal cortical tissues surgically removed from patients and expression of PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors were examined. In functionally intact parenchymal arterioles lower concentrations of PGE<sub>2</sub> (from 10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/l) caused significant, endothelium-independent vasorelaxation, which was inhibited by the EP4 receptor blocker BGC201531. In contrast, higher concentrations of PGE<sub>2</sub> evoked significant EP1-dependent vasoconstriction, which could not be reversed by the EP4 receptor agonist CAY10598. We also confirmed previous observations that PGE<sub>2</sub> primarily evokes constriction in intracerebral arterioles isolated from R. norvegicus. Importantly, vascular mRNA and protein expression of vasodilator EP4 receptors was significantly higher than that of vasoconstrictor EP1 receptors in human cerebral arterioles. PGE<sub>2</sub> at low concentrations dilates whereas at higher concentrations constricts human cerebral parenchymal arterioles. This bimodal vasomotor response is consistent with both the proposed vasodilator role of PGE<sub>2</sub> during functional hyperemia and its putative role in cerebral vasospasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage in human patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The overall aim of this study is to determine how glial cells are commonly involved in the neurodegeneration progress observed in all these pathologies. The suggestion that they are cell types in which prion and prion-like disorders have common behaviour is the hypothesis on which this study is based. Morphological and distribution differences in astroglial and microglial cells in the cerebellum from prion and prion-like disease-affected patients were assessed here by histopathological and immunochemical tools. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the comparative assessment of glial profiles in these human brains. Activated microglial population was demonstrated in both, prion and prion-like disorders, although in higher extent in the first. In astroglial activation, specific patterns of alterations suggesting both degenerative and potentially neuroprotective or restorative stem cell response, were shown to be alternatively shared by cerebella from all disorders studied. Neuro-protective strategies for these disabling disorders are particularly desirable.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such RNA molecules have gained much attention from biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which led to the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ncRNA therapeutic in 2018. However, the main barrier in clinical practice of ncRNAs is the lack of an effective delivery system that can protect the RNA molecules from nuclease degradation, deliver them to specific tissues and cell types, and release them into the cytoplasm of the targeted cells, all without inducing adverse effects. For that reason, drug delivery approaches, formulations, technologies and systems for transporting pharmacological ncRNA compounds to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect in the human body are in demand. Here, we review the development of therapeutic lipid-based nanoparticles for delivery of miRNAs, one class of endogenous ncRNAs with specific regulatory functions. We outline challenges and opportunities for advanced miRNA-based therapies, and discuss the complexity associated with the delivery of functional miRNAs. Novel strategies are addressed how to deal with the most critical points in miRNA delivery, such as toxicity, specific targeting of disease sites, proper cellular uptake and endosomal escape of miRNAs. Current fields of application and various preclinical settings involving miRNA therapeutics are discussed, providing an outlook to future clinical approaches. Following the current trends and technological developments in nanomedicine exciting new delivery systems for ncRNA-based therapeutics can be expected in upcoming years.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent epidemiological studies have shown that human aging is associated with an increased frequency of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system, which provide a competitive advantage to a mutant cell, thus allowing for its clonal expansion, a phenomenon known as clonal hematopoiesis. Unexpectedly, these mutations have been associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, suggesting a previously unrecognized connection between somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells and cardiovascular disease. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of clonal hematopoiesis and its association with aging and cardiovascular disease. We also give a detailed report of the experimental studies that have been instrumental in understanding the relationship between clonal hematopoiesis and cardiovascular disease and have shed light on the mechanisms by which hematopoietic somatic mutations contribute to disease pathology.

Previously we revealed that ESCs may undergo premature senescence, accompanied by proliferation loss and various intracellular alterations. Here we focused on whether and how senescence may be transmitted within the ESCs population. We revealed that senescent ESCs may induce paracrine senescence in young counterparts via cell contacts, secreted factors and extracellular vesicles. According to secretome-wide profiling we identified plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) to be the most prominent protein secreted by senescent ESCs (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015742). By applying CRISPR/Cas9 techniques we disclosed that PAI-1 secreted by senescent ESCs may serve as the master-regulator of paracrine senescence progression within the ESCs population. Unraveled molecular basis of senescence transduction in the ESCs population may be further considered in terms of altered endometrial plasticity and sensitivity to invading embryo, thus contributing to the female infertility curing.</AbstractText>"}

However, advanced aging comes at a price, as it is associated with an increased incidence of the so-called age-related conditions, including a greater risk for loss of functional independence. How to combat sarcopenia, frailty, and overall intrinsic capacity decline in the elderly is a major challenge for modern medicine, and exercise appears to be a potential solution. In this article, we first summarize the physiological mechanisms underlying the age-related deterioration in intrinsic capacity, particularly regarding those phenotypes related to functional decline. The main methods available for the physical assessment of the oldest old are then described, and finally the multisystem benefits that exercise (or 'exercise mimetics' in those situations in which volitional exercise is not feasible) can provide to this population segment are reviewed. In summary, lifetime physical exercise can help to attenuate the loss of many of the properties affected by aging, especially when the latter is accompanied by an inactive lifestyle and benefits can also be obtained in frail individuals who start exercising at an advanced age. Multicomponent programs combining mainly aerobic and resistance training should be included in the oldest old, particularly during disuse situations such as hospitalization. However, evidence is still needed to support the effectiveness of passive physical strategies including neuromuscular electrical stimulation or vibration for the prevention of disuse-induced negative adaptations in those oldest old people who are unable to do physical exercise. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

An individualized treatment plan to restore facial shape can be achieved with deep compartment volume augmentation and repositioning of superficial facial fat using the superficial musculoaponeurotic system.</AbstractText>"}

Older adults often have difficulty managing this increased load of health information. Although many home healthcare nurses (HCNs) provide assistance to older adults after discharge from medical facilities, little is known about HCNs' experiences with older adults regarding the management and transfer of PHI in their homes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to 1) determine how HCNs obtain and provide health information, 2) describe the perspective of HCNs regarding older adult PHI, and 3) identify the potential role of technology in older adult health information transfer. We conducted and analyzed semistructured phone interviews with 17 HCNs from two home healthcare agencies. Five thematic areas emerged from interviews with HCNs: 1) common practices of obtaining health information; 2) barriers to obtaining health information; 3) ideal ways to obtain and provide health information; 4) use of patient portals; and 5) HCNs' use of technology for health information exchange. Most HCNs reported that it would be difficult for older adult patients to update their PHI without assistance, but HCNs lack the time and resources to assist older adults in PHI management activities.</AbstractText>"}

To explore this issue, we investigated whether a class of biologically active profibrotic lipids, the leukotrienes (LT), is part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The analysis of conditioned medium (CM), lipid extracts, and gene expression of LT biosynthesis enzymes revealed that senescent cells secreted LT, regardless of the origin of the cells or the modality of senescence induction. The synthesis of LT was biphasic and followed by antifibrotic prostaglandin (PG) secretion. The LT-rich CM of senescent lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) induced profibrotic signaling in naive fibroblasts, which were abrogated by inhibitors of ALOX5, the principal enzyme in LT biosynthesis. The bleomycin-induced expression of genes encoding LT and PG synthases, level of cysteinyl LT in the bronchoalveolar lavage, and overall fibrosis were reduced upon senescent cell removal either in a genetic mouse model or after senolytic treatment. Quantification of ALOX5+ cells in lung explants obtained from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients indicated that half of these cells were also senescent (p16Ink4a+). Unlike human fibroblasts from unused donor lungs made senescent by irradiation, senescent IPF fibroblasts secreted LTs but failed to synthesize PGs. This study demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge that senescent cells secrete functional LTs, significantly contributing to the LT pool known to cause or exacerbate IPF.</AbstractText>"}

Although many species are implicated as vectors, not all contribute equally to disease transmission, with demonstrated variation in vector efficiency between and within species. We investigated the vector efficiency of mosquitoes derived from wild-caught North Carolina populations of two known heartworm vectors: a native species, Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae), and an invasive species, Aedes albopictus (Skuse). We compared the parasite developmental times within the mosquito, mosquito longevity and fecundity, and the vector efficiency index between the two species. We found that the tested composite North Carolina population of Ae. triseriatus was an efficient vector of D. immitis under laboratory conditions, whereas the local composite population of Ae. albopictus was a competent but relatively poor vector. Compared with Ae. triseriatus, Ae. albopictus showed a longer time for parasite development, lower infection rates, and lower vector efficiency. Additionally, Ae. albopictus was the sole species to exhibit significant parasite-induced mortality. These results are in contrast to prior studies of populations of Ae. albopictus from locations outside of North Carolina, which have implicated the species as a highly competent heartworm vector. The variation seen for different strains of the same species emphasizes the heritable nature of D. immitis vector competence and highlights the need for local infection studies for accurate transmission risk assessment in a particular locale.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Rodents exhibit age-related declines in skeletal muscle function that is associated with muscle denervation and cellular senescence. Exercise training is a proven method to delay or even reverse some aging phenotypes, thus improving healthspan in the elderly. The beneficial effects of exercise to preserve muscle may be reliant on an individual's innate ability to adapt to aerobic training. To examine this question, we assessed aged rats that were selectively bred to be either minimally or highly responsive to aerobic exercise training. We specifically asked whether mild treadmill training initiated late in life would be beneficial to preserve muscle function in high response and low response trainer rats. We examined gene expression data on markers of denervation and senescence. We also evaluated measures of aerobic training and neuromuscular muscle function through work capacity, contractile properties, and endplate fragmentation for further analysis of the aging phenotype in older rodents.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

After the advent of smart wearables in the market, each individual now expects to be delivered with state-of-the-art reports about his body. The most dominant wearables in the market often focus on general metrics such as the number of steps, distance walked, heart rate, oximetry, sleep quality, and sleep stage. But, for accurately identifying the well-being of an individual, another important metric needs to be analyzed, which is the state of mind. The state of mind is a metric of an individual that boils down to the activity of all other related metrics. But, the detection of the state of mind has formed a huge challenge for the researchers as a single biosignal cannot propose a particular decision threshold for detection. Therefore, in this work, multiple biosignals from different parts of the body are used to determine the state of mind of an individual. The biosignals, blood volume pulse (BVP), and accelerometer are intercepted from a wrist-worn wearable, and electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), and respiration are intercepted from a chest-worn pod. For the classification of the biosignals to the multiple state-of-mind categories, a multichannel convolutional neural network architecture was developed. The overall model performed pretty well and pursued some encouraging results by demonstrating an average recall and precision of 97.238% and 97.652% across all the classes, respectively.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Sabyasachi Chakraborty et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Nitric oxide from inorganic nitrate supplementation has been found to have the same cardioprotective benefits of NO produced by NOS. Moreover, it can effectively compensate for declining NOS activity due to aging or NOS inhibition by oxidative stress, hypoxia, or other factors. This review covers some of the major cardiovascular regulatory actions of NO and presents evidence that NO from inorganic nitrate supplementation can provide (1) compensation when NOS activity is inadequate, and (2) cardioprotective benefits beyond that provided by a healthy NOS system.

Consuming monacolin K on a daily basis reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma levels between 15% and 25% within 6 to 8 weeks. Certainly, the decrease in LDL-cholesterol is accompanied by a similar reduction in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma apolipoprotein B, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Furthermore, the RYR lipid-lowering effect is associated with significant improvements in pulse wave velocity and endothelial function, which are validated and reliable biomarker tools able to detect vascular aging. Although it has a mechanism of action similar to statins, a daily consumption of between 3 and 10 mg monacolin K has only minimal associated risks, and mild myalgias are seen only in the frailest patients (those who also cannot tolerate minimal dosages of statin).

Serum (<i>F</i> = 10.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0030) and dietary (<i>F</i> = 5.0, <i>p</i> = 0.0325) folate concentrations were each linearly related to telomere length in women, but not in men, after controlling for age and race. Serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and telomere length had a nonsignificant, inverse relationship in women, with age and race controlled (<i>F</i> = 2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.1056), but no relation in men. Dietary vitamin B<sub>12</sub> was linearly related to telomere length in women, after adjusting for age and race (<i>F</i> = 4.3, <i>p</i> = 0.0468), but not in men. Overall, evidence indicates that folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels, especially folate, account for meaningful differences in cell aging in women, but not in men.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Larry A.

Cryoablation is a novel technique for pulmonary vein isolation and is considered equally effective as radiofrequency ablation. Some of the known complications of cryoablation include phrenic nerve damage, esophageal injury, pulmonary vein stenosis, new onset atrial flutter, pericardial effusion, and stroke. We present a case of bronchial injury immediately after cryoablation for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A 67-year-old woman underwent successful pulmonary vein isolation using cryoablation. Her post-operative period was complicated with cough and hemoptysis. During the procedure, she had an extra 3 minutes of freezing of the left inferior pulmonary vein. Her bronchoscopy examination showed blood and erythema in the left main bronchus. She was managed conservatively with cough suppressants and anticoagulation was stopped. Possible etiology of bronchial injury is likely cryoenergy transfer between the pulmonary veins and the bronchus due to their close anatomic proximity. With the increasing use of cryoablation for atrial fibrillation, more cases of bronchial injury will likely be reported in the future. Physicians including electrophysiologist and pulmonologists should be aware of this complication.</AbstractText>"}

The best-characterized non‐coding RNA family consists of about 2600 human microRNAs. Rich evidence has revealed their crucial importance in maintaining normal development, differentiation, growth control, aging, modulation of cell survival or apoptosis, as well as migration and metastasis as microRNAs dysregulation leads to cancer incidence and progression. By far, microRNAs have recently emerged as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. The rationale for developing microRNA therapeutics is based on the premise that aberrantly expressed microRNAs play a significant role in the emergence of a variety of human diseases ranging from cardiovascular defects to cancer, and that repairing these microRNA deficiencies by either antagonizing or restoring microRNA function may yield a therapeutic benefit. Although microRNA antagonists are conceptually similar to other inhibitory therapies, improving the performance of microRNAs by microRNA replacement or inhibition that is a less well- described attitude. In this assay, we have condensed the last global knowledge and concepts regarding the involvement of microRNAs in cancer emergence, which has been achieved from the previous studies, consisting of the regulation of key cancer‐related pathways, such as cell cycle control and the DNA damage response and the disruption of profile expression in human cancer. Here, we have reviewed the special characteristics of microRNA replacement and inhibition therapies and discussed explorations linked with the delivery of microRNA mimics in turmeric cells.

It draws on longitudinal qualitative research with heterosexual couples who participated in the <i>Indashyikirwa</i> programme in Rwanda. The couples followed a curriculum designed to improve relationship skills and reduce the gender-inequitable beliefs, behaviours and norms that underpin intimate partner violence. Qualitative findings show that the programme resulted in moderate, but significant, positive 'shifts' in individual beliefs and behaviours, couple relationship dynamics and levels of inequality - increasing men's engagement in domestic duties, women's participation in household decision making, and women's access to economic resources. They also suggest which parts of the couples' curriculum were most effective in catalysing these changes. However, the data also show that these 'shifts' occurred without fully transforming deeply-entrenched beliefs and norms around gender roles and male authority over economic resources. The paper suggests that the persistence of these beliefs and norms constrained the extent of changes among couples - and could potentially constrain their longevity and act as an obstacle to longer-term, larger-scale changes in gender inequalities and violence.</AbstractText>"}

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of prosthesis rehabilitation on the functional capacity of elderly with lower-limb amputation (LLA) in short and long time.<b>Materials and methods:</b> A quasi-experimental study was developed. The sample consisted of 29 elderly with LLA who finished the prosthesis rehabilitation programme. Gait capacity was evaluated by Functional Ambulation Classification Scale (FAC), ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADL) was evaluated by Barthel Index (BI) and Pfeffer Questionnaire was used to evaluate the capacity to execute instrumental ADL. Statistical inference was done by <i>t</i>-test, <i>t</i>-student test and chi-squared test.

Elderly people with a lower-limb amputation impose a heavy burden on health resources, requiring extensive rehabilitation and long term care. The specific presentation of elderly persons with lower-limb amputation, with multiple physical, psychological, cognitive, and social comorbidities, imposes unique challenges to ongoing care. The potential bias from the inclusion of younger patients into a study with an elderly population with lower-limb amputation supports the need for independent investigation.In our study we verified that although elderly with transfemoral or transtibial amputation have improved their functional independence after lower-limb prosthesis rehabilitation, they could not achieve their functional capacity before amputation. This improvement especially occurred for the basic activities of daily living, however elderly patients with transfemoral amputations presented greater difficulty in improving functional capacity.These results support that being able to better select elderly by their mobility potential and environmental barriers, is an important goal for future research to aim toward those who will achieve and maintain prosthetic walking or those who could better focus on regaining nonprosthetic mobility.</AbstractText>"}

Anti-aging properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and cardioprotective activities have been reported for various phytobioactive compounds (PBCs) including resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin, catechin, etc. However, the therapeutic potential of orally administered PBCs is limited by their poor stability, bioavailability, and solubility in the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, innovative nanotechnology-based approaches have been developed to improve the bioactivity of PBCs and enhance their potential in preventing and/or treating age-associated disorders, primarily those caused by aging-related chronic inflammation. PBC-loaded nanoparticles designed for oral administration provide many benefits over conventional formulations, including enhanced stability and solubility, prolonged half-life, improved epithelium permeability and bioavailability, enhanced tissue targeting, and minimized side effects.

Aging pipes are not water-tight anymore and they can leak untreated sewage or allow infiltration of groundwater. In the latter case, more frequent combined sewer overflows (CSOs) may occur. Generally, prompt intervention to repair damaged conduits is envisaged. However, in low-lying coastal regions, sewer systems may provide an unplanned drainage that controls the groundwater table from flooding the urban ground. Here, a study is presented to investigate the influence of the repair of damaged sewer on the water table of an urban shallow aquifer. Sewer and groundwater models were built to describe the effect of sewer replacement. Based on a real dataset, simulations were run for a city located along an estuary. Results show that the presence of infiltration into the sewer system increases the frequency of CSOs, which trigger the discharge of untreated sewage after a minor precipitation or even in dry weather conditions. As the sewer is repaired, CSO spills diminish occurring only upon significant precipitation. However, the water table rises and eventually, during the high tide, the groundwater floods the low-lying part of the city. Overall, this work highlights the susceptibility of shallow aquifers in coastal urban areas and suggests that they should be regarded in flooding predictions.</AbstractText>"}

In comparison with the wild-type Canton-S (CS) males, six characteristics of the phenotype of Dgp-1[843k] mutant were found: (1) low expression of isoform A; (2) augmented expression of isoform B; (3) reduction in the mean lifespan; (4) decrease in the running speed in 3-day-old flies; (5) maintenance of a high run frequency in senescent flies; and (6) resistance to heat stress manifested as maintenance of a high run frequency at 29 °C. After cessation of 'cantonization' process, mean lifespan of the mutant males drifted from low to high values finally exceeding that for CS. In contrast, behavioral phenotype of the mutant was robust. Using the GAL4/UAS system, we showed that neurospecific overexpression of isoform B resulted in a slight decrease of longevity and a high level of run frequency in the senescent flies, similar to that in Dgp-1[843K] mutant. In addition, a decreased level of reactive oxygen species was found in Dgp-1[843K] mutant males maintained under stress conditions. The elevated resistance to oxidative stress probably explains the two distinctive features of the mutation: resistance to aging processes and thermal stress displayed at behavioral level.</AbstractText>"}

We profiled miRNAs in hearts isolated from wild-type, CRE, Tbx5<sup>lox/+</sup>and Tbx5<sup>del/+</sup> mice using a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach. TBX5 deficiency in cardiomyocytes increased the expression of the miR-183 cluster family that is controlled by Kruppel-like factor 4, a transcription factor repressed by TBX5. MiR-182-5p, the most highly expressed miRNA of this family, was functionally analyzed in zebrafish. Transient overexpression of miR-182-5p affected heart morphology, calcium handling and the onset of arrhythmias as detected by ECG tracings. Accordingly, several calcium channel proteins identified as putative miR-182-5p targets were downregulated in miR-182-5p overexpressing hearts. In stable zebrafish transgenic lines, we demonstrated that selective miRNA-182-5p upregulation contributes to arrhythmias. Moreover, cardiac-specific down-regulation of miR-182-5p rescued cardiac defects in a zebrafish model of Holt-Oram syndrome. In conclusion, miR-182-5p exerts an evolutionarily conserved role as a TBX5 effector in the onset of cardiac propensity for arrhythmia, and constitutes a relevant target for mediating the relationship between TBX5, arrhythmia and heart development.</AbstractText>"}

Successful surgical treatment requires complete resection of tumors to reduce recurrence rates. To reach this goal, novel methods combining in vivo tumor and tumor margin detection with low invasive precision surgical tools are needed. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging is a highly promising optical tool for visualizing tumors based on characteristic changes in tissue morphology and molecular composition, while fs-laser ablation is to date the most precise surgical tool established in ophthalmology. In this contribution, CARS imaging has been combined with fs-laser ablation as a new approach for image-guided precision surgery for the first time. CARS guided fs-ablation has been applied to ablate brain, liver, skin, muscular and vascular tissues with μm-precision using sub-100 fs pulses of μJ level. We demonstrate superior imaging performance and contrast as well as detection of tissue margins by coherent Raman microscopy in comparison to laser reflectance imaging.

However, whether ageing also affects the HSC niche, and thereby impairs its capacity to support HSC function, is still widely debated. Here, by using in-vivo long-term label-retention assays we demonstrate that aged label-retaining HSCs, which are, in old mice, the most quiescent HSC subpopulation with the highest regenerative capacity and cellular polarity, reside predominantly in perisinusoidal niches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sinusoidal niches are uniquely preserved in shape, morphology and number on ageing. Finally, we show that myeloablative chemotherapy can selectively disrupt aged sinusoidal niches in the long term, which is linked to the lack of recovery of endothelial Jag2 at sinusoids. Overall, our data characterize the functional alterations of the aged HSC niche and unveil that perisinusoidal niches are uniquely preserved and thereby protect HSCs from ageing.</AbstractText>"}

These results shed light on pan-tissue mutations characteristic of field cancerization, the presence of oncogenic processes adjacent to cancer cells.</AbstractText>"}

Recent developments in 3D printing technologies by direct ink-write have opened the possibility of replacing stochastic foam parts by more controlled printed micro-structures with superior stress-distribution and longer functional life. For successful deployment as mechanical support or structural components, it is crucial to characterize the response of such printed materials to long-term external loads in terms of stress-strain behavior evolution and in terms of irreversible structural and load-bearing capacity changes over time. To this end, here we report a thermal-age-aware constitutive model for a 3D printed close-packed foam structure under compression. The model is based on the Ogden hyperfoam strain-energy functional within the framework of Tobolsky two-network scheme. It accurately describes experimentally measured stress-strain response, compression set, and load retention for various aging times and temperatures. Through the technique of time-temperature-superposition the model enables the prediction of long-term changes along with the quantification of uncertainty stemming from sample-to-sample variation and measurement noise. All aging parameters appear to possess the same Arrhenius activation barrier, which suggests a single dominant aging mechanism at the molecular/network level.</AbstractText>"}

Synaptic impairments are robust within the AD brain and better correlate with dementia severity when compared with other pathological features of the disease. Nevertheless, the series of events that promote synaptic failure still remain under debate, as potential triggers such as β-amyloid (Aβ) can vary in size, configuration and cellular location, challenging data interpretation in causation studies. Here we present data obtained using adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs that drive the expression of oligomeric Aβ either intra or extracellularly. We observed that expression of Aβ in both cellular compartments affect learning and memory, reduce the number of synapses and the expression of synaptic-related proteins, and disrupt chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). Together, these findings indicate that during the progression AD the early accumulation of Aβ inside neurons is sufficient to promote morphological and functional cellular toxicity, a phenomenon that can be exacerbated by the buildup of Aβ in the brain parenchyma. Moreover, our AAV constructs represent a valuable tool in the investigation of the pathological properties of Aβ oligomers both in vivo and in vitro.</AbstractText>"}

This review article focuses on two biomolecules called 'neuromedin U (NMU)' and 'myostatin' that are deeply involved in obesity and muscle weakness caused by modern lifestyles and aging. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study based on a biomolecule reveals the structural features required for the biological activity and gives clues leading the drug discovery process. NMU activates two types of receptors (NMUR1 and NMUR2). NMU, which is an attractive candidate for treating obesity, displays a variety of physiological actions in addition to appetite suppression. The discovery of useful receptor-selective agonists helps in elucidating the detailed roles of the respective receptors for each action and in developing therapeutic drugs based on receptor function. Hence, SAR studies focused on the amidated C-terminal heptapeptide of NMU were carried out to obtain selective agonists. Consequently, the respective hexapeptidic NMUR1 and NMUR2 agonists CPN-267 and CPN-116 were discovered. Myostatin, an endogenous negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass, is a promising target for treating muscle atrophy disorders. Focused on the inactivation mechanism of mature myostatin by the myostatin precursor-derived prodomain, a core peptide (23-mer) for effective myostatin inhibition was identified from the mouse myostatin prodomain sequence. The SAR study based on this core peptide afforded a 25-fold more potent derivative (16-mer), which increased skeletal muscle mass and hindlimb grip strength. Therefore, this derivative could be a novel platform for a peptidic drug useful in the treatment of muscle atrophy.</AbstractText>"}

The administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has been shown to mitigate aging-related dysfunctions. However, the safety of NMN in humans have remained unclear. We, therefore, conducted a clinical trial to investigate the safety of single NMN administration in 10 healthy men. A single-arm non-randomized intervention was conducted by single oral administration of 100, 250, and 500 mg NMN. Clinical findings and parameters, and the pharmacokinetics of NMN metabolites were investigated for 5 h after each intervention. Ophthalmic examination and sleep quality assessment were also conducted before and after the intervention. The single oral administrations of NMN did not cause any significant clinical symptoms or changes in heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Laboratory analysis results did not show significant changes, except for increases in serum bilirubin levels and decreases in serum creatinine, chloride, and blood glucose levels within the normal ranges, independent of the dose of NMN. Results of ophthalmic examination and sleep quality score showed no differences before and after the intervention. Plasma concentrations of N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide were significantly increased dose-dependently by NMN administration. The single oral administration of NMN was safe and effectively metabolized in healthy men without causing any significant deleterious effects. Thus, the oral administration of NMN was found to be feasible, implicating a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate aging-related disorders in humans.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we comprehensively and systematically investigated changes in blood vessel function with age using a 336-dipeptide library. In the early stage of hypertension, the most potent vasorelaxant dipeptide was Ser-Tyr (SY) in the mesenteric artery isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SY-induced vasorelaxation and anti-hypertensive effects were blocked by L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), suggesting that SY activates the NO system. On the other hand, the patterns of dipeptides with vasorelaxation activity in early and advanced stages of hypertension were different. In the advanced stage, the most potent vasorelaxing dipeptide was Asn-Ala (NA). Orally administered NA (1.5 mg/kg) reduced the blood pressure in the advanced stage, at which drugs were sometimes less effective, and the anti-hypertensive effects lasted for 6 hr. The NA-induced vasorelaxation and anti-hypertensive activity was blocked by lorglumide, an antagonist of the cholecystokinin CCK<sub>1</sub> receptor, suggesting that NA activated the CCK system.

Differential tau isoforms, expression levels, promoters, and disruption of endogenous genes in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the biological role of tau in these models. We addressed this shortcoming by characterizing the molecular and cognitive phenotypes associated with the pathogenic P301L tau mutation (rT2 mice) in relation to a genetically matched transgenic mouse overexpressing nonmutant (NM) 4-repeat (4R) human tau (rT1 mice). Both male and female mice were included in this study. Unexpectedly, we found that 4R NM human tau (hTau) exhibited abnormal dynamics in young mice that were lost with the P301L mutation, including elevated protein stability and hyperphosphorylation, which were associated with cognitive impairment in 5-month-old rT1 mice. Hyperphosphorylation of NM hTau was observed as early as 4 weeks of age, and transgene suppression for the first 4 or 12 weeks of life prevented abnormal molecular and cognitive phenotypes in rT1, demonstrating that NM hTau pathogenicity is specific to postnatal development. We also show that NM hTau exhibits stronger binding to microtubules than P301L hTau, and is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Overall, our genetically matched mice have revealed that 4R NM hTau overexpression is pathogenic in a manner distinct from classical aging-related tauopathy, underlining the importance of assaying the effects of transgenic disease-related proteins at appropriate stages in life.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Due to differences in creation of transgenic lines, the pathological properties of the P301L mutation confers to the tau protein <i>in vivo</i> have remained elusive, perhaps contributing to the lack of disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies. In an attempt to characterize P301L-specific effects on tau biology and cognition in novel genetically matched transgenic mouse models, we surprisingly found that nonmutant human tau has development-specific pathogenic properties of its own. Our findings indicate that overexpression of 4-repeat human tau during postnatal development is associated with excessive microtubule binding, which may disrupt important cellular processes, such as mitochondrial dynamics, leading to elevated stability and hyperphosphorylation of tau, and eventual cognitive impairments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and we demonstrate its benefits to diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise in promoting extended healthspan of multiple <i>C. elegans</i> tissues, underscore the potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The presence of any one such disease usually increases the risk of having others, and new approaches will be more effective at increasing an individual's health span by taking this systems-level view into account. In this study, we developed gene therapies based on 3 longevity associated genes (fibroblast growth factor 21 [FGF21], αKlotho, soluble form of mouse transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 [sTGFβR2]) delivered using adeno-associated viruses and explored their ability to mitigate 4 age-related diseases: obesity, type II diabetes, heart failure, and renal failure. Individually and combinatorially, we applied these therapies to disease-specific mouse models and found that this set of diverse pathologies could be effectively treated and in some cases, even reversed with a single dose. We observed a 58% increase in heart function in ascending aortic constriction ensuing heart failure, a 38% reduction in α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression, and a 75% reduction in renal medullary atrophy in mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction and a complete reversal of obesity and diabetes phenotypes in mice fed a constant high-fat diet. Crucially, we discovered that a single formulation combining 2 separate therapies into 1 was able to treat all 4 diseases. These results emphasize the promise of gene therapy for treating diverse age-related ailments and demonstrate the potential of combination gene therapy that may improve health span and longevity by addressing multiple diseases at once.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The consequences of an age-related reduction in muscle mass have not been fully investigated and, therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the muscle and joint contact forces using musculoskeletal modelling, during a sit-to-stand activity, to better explain difficulties in performing everyday activities for older people. A sit-to-stand activity with and without the use of arm rests was observed in ninety-five male participants, placed into groups of young (aged 18-35 years), middle-aged (aged 40-60 years) or older adults (aged 65 years and over). Older participants demonstrated significantly lower knee extensor and joint forces than the young when not using arm rests, compensating through elevated hip extensor and ankle plantarflexor muscle activity. The older group were also found to have higher shoulder joint contact forces whilst using arm rests. This tendency to reorganise muscle recruitment to include neighbouring groups or other parts of the body could make everyday activities more susceptible to age-related functional decline. Reductions in leg strength, via age- or atrophy- related means, creates increased reliance on the upper body and may result in further lower limb atrophy through disuse. The eventual decline of upper body function reduces strength reserves, leading to increased vulnerability, dependence on others and risk of institutionalisation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These are associated with loss of muscle function and accelerate rapidly from the age of 60 years, leading to the conditions of sarcopenia and frailty. As the relationship between muscle ageing and macronutrient metabolism and utilisation has seen limited research to date, this review focuses on the interactions between skeletal muscle changes during ageing, metabolism and utilisation of fat, carbohydrates and overall energy expenditure.Skeletal muscle contributes less to resting energy expenditure during ageing, potentially contributing to onset of obesity from middle age. Age-related changes to skeletal muscle lead to glucose dysregulation, with consequent reduction in glycaemic control, increased insulin resistance and ultimately onset of type-2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate that high total fat and SFA intake are detrimental to skeletal muscle, while higher intakes of PUFA are protective. Age-associated changes in skeletal muscle may also reduce total fatty acid utilisation.In conclusion, further research is needed to understand the relationships between macronutrient metabolism and utilisation and age-related changes to skeletal muscle. No dietary recommendations exist specifically for skeletal muscle health during ageing, but we advise individuals to follow healthy eating guidelines, by consuming sufficient protein, fruit and vegetables, and limited SFA and to maintain physically active lifestyles. Clinicians responsible for managing type-2 diabetes need to be aware of growing evidence relating age-related skeletal muscle changes to diabetes onset and progression.</AbstractText>"}

While this process is multifaceted, age-related changes to skeletal muscle are expected to contribute to impaired glucose metabolism. Some of these changes include sarcopenia, impaired insulin signaling, and imbalances in glucose utilization. Endurance and resistance exercise training have been endorsed as interventions to improve glucose tolerance and whole-body insulin sensitivity in the elderly. While both types of exercise generally increase insulin sensitivity in older adults, the metabolic pathways through which this occurs can differ and can be dependent on preexisting conditions including obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we will first highlight age-related changes to skeletal muscle which can contribute to insulin resistance, followed by a comparison of endurance and resistance training adaptations to insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in older adults.</AbstractText>"}

Maybe starting as an annoyance, this decline can become a major impediment to normal daily life. Recent research shows that the neurodegenerative disorders responsible for age associated cognitive dysfunction are mechanistically linked to the state of the microvasculature in the brain. When the microvasculature does not function properly, ischemia, hypoxia, oxidative stress and related pathologic processes ensue, further damaging vascular and neural function. One of the most important and specialized functions of the brain microvasculature is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which controls the movement of molecules between blood circulation and the brain parenchyma. In this review, we are focusing on tight junctions (TJs), the multiprotein complexes that play an important role in establishing and maintaining barrier function. After a short introduction of the cell types that modulate barrier function via intercellular communication, we examine how age, age related pathologies and the aging of the immune system affects TJs. Then, we review how the TJs are affected in age associated neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Lastly, we summarize the TJ aspects of Huntington's disease and schizophrenia. Barrier dysfunction appears to be a common denominator in neurological disorders, warranting detailed research into the molecular mechanisms behind it. Learning the commonalities and differences in the pathomechanism of the BBB injury in different neurological disorders will predictably lead to development of new therapeutics that improve our life as we age.</AbstractText>"}

Using the 2000 and 2010 census data at the sub-regional level, the SEM (spatial error model) estimation suggests that at least seven socio-economic factors are associated with the evolution of the ageing pattern in northeast China, including birth rate, mortality, education, healthcare conditions, the level of economic development, urbanization, and population mobility. However, these associations vary according to time and space, which are further confirmed by the geographical weighted regression (GWR). These findings imply that there are complicated and diversified factors which may be associated with the deteriorating population ageing at the local level in northeast China. Therefore, the sustainable development of the northeast region may not be delivered by dichotomous policy interventions, such as the control of birth rate or mortality rate, as many of the previous studies have focused on; instead, the implementation of ageing policy shall be consistent and complementary with the principles of social benefits, for example, providing incentives for improving regional economic structures, or by policies aimed at building up an adequate 'tolerant culture' for slowing down population outflows.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we examined whether environmental lighting conditions influence the anti-inflammatory benefits of exercise in a rat model of OA. Moderate-intensity treadmill exercise (Ex) was performed for six weeks under a 12:12 h light/dark (L/D) cycle, and compared against rats housed in a 24 h continuous light (L/L) environment. L/L conditions were associated with serological changes shortly after OA induction, which exacerbated the inflammatory microenvironment in the joint. Differentiation capacity was also impaired in bone precursor cells isolated from normal rats maintained under L/L conditions, despite elevated inflammatory responses. Exercise training under L/L conditions led to increased corticosterone levels in the blood, which exacerbated the progression of cartilaginous and synovial lesions. Osteoporotic phenomena were also observed in exercise-trained rats maintained under L/L conditions, along with inflammation-induced catabolism in the gastrocnemius muscle. Aberrant light/dark cycle conditions were also found to be associated with suppression of splenic <i>Cry1</i> expression in exercise-trained rats, leading to dysregulation of immune responses. Taken together, these data suggest that lighting condition may be an important environmental factor influencing the exercise-induced benefits on OA.</AbstractText>"}

In Parkinson's disease (PD), these strategies should aim at improving diagnosis accuracy and frequency of the clinical follow-up by means of decentralized cost-effective solutions. In this context, a system suitable for the remote monitoring of PD subjects is presented. It consists of the integration of two approaches investigated in our previous works, each one appropriate for the movement analysis of specific parts of the body: low-cost optical devices for the upper limbs and wearable sensors for the lower ones. The system performs the automated assessments of six motor tasks of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, and it is equipped with a gesture-based human machine interface designed to facilitate the user interaction and the system management. The usability of the system has been evaluated by means of standard questionnaires, and the accuracy of the automated assessment has been verified experimentally. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution represents a substantial improvement in PD assessment respect to the former two approaches treated separately, and a new example of an accurate, feasible and cost-effective mean for the decentralized management of PD.</AbstractText>"}

Seem (AS) is widely been for treating many diseases, enhancing energy, and boosting immunity; however, its protective effects against high-glucose (HG)-triggered endothelial dysfunction and the potential underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, we determined the effect of AS on senescence in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and elucidated the mechanisms underlying its anti-aging effects. The senescence model of endothelial cells (ECs) was established by culturing HUVECs in media containing HG (30 mM). We found that the proportion of senescent (senescence-associated β-galactosidase+) cells in the HG group was significantly higher than that in the control group; however, this increase was suppressed by AS treatment. Moreover, cell cycle analysis revealed that AS (20 μg/mL) significantly recovered HG-induced cell cycle arrest in ECs, and Western blot revealed that AS prevented HG-induced decreases in silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) level and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation. These results show that AS delayed HG-induced senescence in ECs by modulation of the SIRT1/5' AMP-activated protein kinase and AKT/eNOS pathways.</AbstractText>"}

Defects in heterochromatin can cause the de-repression of genes and transposons, leading to deleterious physiological changes such as aging, cancer, and neurological disorders. While the roles of topoisomerases in many DNA-based processes have been investigated and reviewed, their roles in heterochromatin formation and function are only beginning to be understood. In this review, we discuss recent findings on how topoisomerases can promote heterochromatin organization and impact the transcription of genes and transposons. We will focus on two topoisomerases: Top2α, which catenates and decatenates double-stranded DNA, and Top3β, which can change the topology of not only DNA, but also RNA. Both enzymes are required for normal heterochromatin formation and function, as the inactivation of either protein by genetic mutations or chemical inhibitors can result in defective heterochromatin formation and the de-silencing of transposons. These defects may contribute to the shortened lifespan and neurological disorders observed in individuals carrying mutations of Top3β. We propose that topological stress may be generated in both DNA and RNA during heterochromatin formation and function, which depend on multiple topoisomerases to resolve.</AbstractText>"}

Twelve older adults were recruited for walk-along interviews through the use of purposeful convenience sampling. A content analysis was conducted using NVivo 11 via an inductive approach. Research results revealed 12 categories of environmental factors that affected older adults' OOHBs: access to facilities (shops and services, public transit, and connectivity), pedestrian infrastructure (sidewalk quality, sheltered walkways, universal design, crossings, benches, and public toilets), aesthetics (natural elements, buildings, noise, and cleanliness), traffic safety (behavior of other road users and road width), safety from crime, wayfinding, familiarity (long-term residency and routine activities), weather, social contact, high-rise, high-density (lifts, population density, flat size, and privacy), affordability (shops and services, as well as transportation), and maintenance and upgrading. This analysis concluded that access to facilities and pedestrian infrastructure are important for older adults' OOHBs. Considering Singapore's weather, sheltered walkways, the proximity of facilities and connectivity should be given serious emphasis.

Considerable evidence suggests that not only the amount, but also the quality, of public green spaces in the living environment is important. The quality of public green spaces is mostly measured through expert assessments by planners, designers and developers. A disadvantage of this expert-determined approach is that it often does not consider the appraisals or perceptions of residents. Daily experience, often over long periods of time, means older residents have acquired insider knowledge of their neighbourhood, and thus, may be more qualified to assess these spaces, including measuring what makes a valued or quality public green space. The aim of this Australian pilot study on public green spaces for ageing well was to test an innovative citizen science approach to data collection using smart phones. 'Senior' citizen scientists trialed the smart phone audit tool over a three-month period, recording and auditing public green spaces in their neighbourhoods. Data collected included geocoded location data, photographs, and qualitative comments along with survey data. While citizen science research is already well established in the natural sciences, it remains underutilised in the social sciences. This paper focuses on the use of citizen science with older participants highlighting the potential for this methodology in the fields of environmental gerontology, urban planning and landscape architecture.</AbstractText>"}

A series of characterizations showed that RSV stays in the silica aerogel in two ways. First, RSV precipitates due to minimal solubility in water during the solvent replacement process. After freeze drying, the solvent evaporates and the RSV recrystallizes. It can be seen from scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images that the recrystallized RSV with micron-sized long rod-shaped is integrated with the dense silica network skeleton. Second, from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results, a portion of the RSV molecules is not crystallized and the size is extremely small. This can be attached to the primary and secondary particles of silica to enhance its network structure and inhibit shrinkage, which is why the volume and pore size of RLSA is larger. In addition, the diffusion of RSV in silica alcogel was studied by a one-dimensional model. The apparent diffusion coefficients of inward diffusion, outward diffusion and internal diffusion were calculated by fitting the time- and position-dependent concentration data. It was found that the outward diffusion coefficient (5.25 × 10<sup>-10</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s) is larger than the inward (2.93 × 10<sup>-10</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s), which is probably due to the interface effect. The diffusion coefficients obtained for different concentrations in the same process (inward diffusion) are found to be different.

Spectrophotometers were used to measure the lightness (L(*)), red green color value (a(*)) and blue yellow color value (b(*)) of all samples before and after accelerated ageing process, and the changes of color variation (ΔE) was calculated. The effect of composite ceramic thickness and resin cement color on the changes of color variation (ΔE) before and after the ageing of CAD/CAM composite ceramic/resin cement and whether there was an interaction between them were tested by two-way ANOVA. <b>Results:</b> Before and after accelerated ageing, the ΔE of CAD/CAM composite ceramic/resin cements were &lt;3.3. Two-way ANOVA showed that the thickness of CAD/CAM composite ceramics had an effect on ΔE (<i>F=</i>27.025, <i>P&lt;</i>0.001), and the color of resin cement also had an effect on ΔE (<i>F=</i>15.606, <i>P&lt;</i>0.001), but there was no interaction between them (<i>F=</i>0.534, <i>P=</i>0.829). <b>Conclusions:</b> The thickness of CAD/CAM composite ceramics and the color of resin cements could both affect the color stability of composite ceramic/resin cements combination. However, the resulted color change is within the clinically acceptable range.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, to gain an insight into the pathogenesis and the potential biomarkers of OA, we implemented a comparative urine proteomics study on OA patients and health people using iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry technology. Western blotting was used to validate the relative changes in urine protein levels for four of the identified proteins. We constructed a comprehensive urine proteome profile of the OA patients and identified 102 proteins differently changed in abundance. Forty-six proteins were upregulated and 56 proteins were significantly downregulated in OA patients. Furthermore, the proteins, COL-4, MMP9, adiponectin, and BBOX1 were validated through Western blots, which can serve as valuable candidate biomarkers and help to illustrate the pathogenesis of OA. These findings may provide clues for promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis and also offer a theoretical basis for the early treatment of OA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Firstly, we found that the expression level of SNHG14 was elevated in brain tissues of PD mice. In MN9D cells, the rotenone treatment (1μmol/L) enhanced the binding between transcriptional factor SP-1 and SNHG14 promoter, thus promoting SNHG14 expression. Interference of SNHG14 ameliorated the DA neuron injury induced by rotenone. Next, we found an interaction between SNHG14 and miR-133b. Further study showed that miR-133b down-regulated α-syn expression by targeting its 3'-UTR of mRNA and SNHG14 could reverse the negative effect of miR-133b on α-syn expression. Interference of SNHG14 reduced rotenone-induced DA neuron damage through miR-133b in MN9D cells and α-syn was responsible for the protective effect of miR-133b. Similarly, interference of SNHG14 mitigated neuron injury in PD mouse model. All in all, silence of SNHG14 mitigates dopaminergic neuron injury by down-regulating α-syn via targeting miR-133b, which contributes to improving PD.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, the clinical utility of miRNAs as biomarkers and drug targets for bone diseases certainly merits further investigation. This study describes the use of an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis to generate a comprehensive dataset on miRNA regulation in bone tissue and peripheral blood during bone loss and specifically anti-resorptive and osteo-anabolic treatment. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to SHAM surgery (n=10) or ovariectomy (OVX, n=32). Eight weeks after surgery, OVX animals were further randomized to anti-resorptive treatment with zoledronate (n=11), osteo-anabolic treatment with teriparatide (n=11), or vehicle treatment (n=10). After 12 weeks of treatment, bone and serum samples were used for microRNA analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS), mRNA levels using RT-qPCR, and bone microarchitecture analysis using nanoCT. Ovariectomy resulted in loss of trabecular bone, which was fully rescued using osteo-anabolic treatment, and partially rescued using anti-resorptive treatment. NGS revealed that both, anti-resorptive and anabolic treatment had a significant impact on miRNA levels in bone tissue and serum: out of 426 detected miRNAs, 46 miRNAs were regulated by teriparatide treatment an d 10 by zoledronate treatment (p-adj.&lt;0.1). Interestingly, teriparatide and zoledronate treatment were able to revert miRNA changes in tissue and serum of untreated OVX animals, such as the up-regulation of miR-203a-3p, a known osteo-inhibitory miRNA. We confirmed previously established mechanisms of miR-203a by analyzing its direct target Dlx5 in femoral head. Our data reveal a significant effect of ovariectomy-induced bone loss, as well as the two major types of anti-osteoporotic treatment on miRNA transcription in femoral head tissue. These changes are associated with altered activity of target genes relevant to bone formation, such as Dlx5. The observed effects of bone loss and treatment response on miRNA levels in bone are also reflected in the peripheral blood, suggesting the possibility of minimally-invasive monitoring of bone-derived miRNAs using liquid biopsies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Larger WMH volumes have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and with cognitive decline. However, the relationship between WMH volumes and cross-sectional cognitive measures has been inconsistent. We hypothesize that this inconsistency may arise from 1) the presence of AD-specific neuropathology that may obscure any WMH effects on cognition, and 2) varying criteria for creating a WMH segmentation. Manual and automated programs are typically used to determine segmentation boundaries, but criteria for those boundaries can differ. It remains unclear whether WMH volumes are associated with cognitive deficits, and which segmentation criteria influence the relationships between WMH volumes and clinical outcomes. In a sample of 260 non-demented participants (ages 55-90, 141 males, 119 females) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we compared the performance of five WMH segmentation methods, by relating the WMH volumes derived using each method to both clinical diagnosis and composite measures of executive function and memory. To separate WMH effects on cognition from effects related to AD-specific processes, we performed analyses separately in people with and without abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid levels. WMH volume estimates that excluded more diffuse, lower-intensity lesions were more strongly correlated with clinical diagnosis and cognitive performance, and only in those without abnormal amyloid levels. These findings may inform best practices for WMH segmentation, and suggest that AD neuropathology may mask WMH effects on clinical diagnosis and cognition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent behavioral research has indicated that the visual configuration of the information that is presented to older adults influences the degree to which this binding deficit is exhibited by older adults (Overman, Dennis et al, 2019; Overman, Dennis, et al., 2018). The purpose of the present study was to further clarify the neural underpinnings of the associative deficit in aging and to examine whether functional activity at encoding differs with respect to the visual configuration and the type of associative being encoded. Using both univariate and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we found differences in both the magnitude of activation and pattern of neural responses associated with the type of association encoded (item-item and item-context). Specifically, our results suggest that, when controlling for stimuli composition, patterns of activation in sensory and frontal regions within the associative encoding network are able to distinguish between different types of associations. With respect to the MTL, multivariate results suggest that only patterns of activation in the PrC in older, but not younger adults, can distinguish between associations types. These findings extend prior work regarding the neural basis of associative memory in young and older adults, and extends the predictions of the binding of item and context model (BIC; Diana, Yonelinas, Ranganath, 2007) to older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a lack of standardized techniques for this non-traditional laboratory animal. In an effort to characterize the model, we developed a chromatic pupillometry setup and analysis protocol to characterize the pupillary light reflex (PLR) in our animals. The PLR is a biomarker to detect early signs for central nervous system deterioration. Chromatic pupillometry is a non-invasive and anesthesia-free method that can evaluate different aspects of the PLR, including the response of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), the disfunction of which has been linked to various disorders. We studied the PLR of 12 degus between 6 and 48 months of age to characterize responses to LEDs of 390, 450, 500, 525 and 605 nm, and used 5 with overall better responses to establish a benchmark for healthy PLR (PLR+) and deteriorated PLR (PLR-). Degu pupils contracted up to 65% of their horizontal resting size before reaching saturation. The highest sensitivity was found at 500 nm, with similar sensitivities at lower tested intensities for 390 nm, coinciding with the medium wavelength and short wavelength cones of the degu. We also tested the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR), which is driven exclusively by ipRGCs. PIPR was largest in response to 450 nm light, with the pupil preserving 48% of its maximum constriction 9 s after the stimulus, in contrast with 24% preserved in response to 525 nm, response driven mainly by cones. PLR- animals showed maximum constriction between 40% and 50% smaller than PLR+, and their PIPR almost disappeared, pointing to a disfunction of the iPRGCs rather than the retinal photoreceptors. Our method thus allows us to non-invasively estimate the condition of experimental animals before attempting other procedures.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We established a rat model of CIRI, which exhibited higher neurological deficit scores and a greater number of apoptotic cells in the cerebral ischemic penumbra than controls. Dexmedetomidine reversed the neuronal apoptosis and improved neurological function in this model. We then examined Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) expression on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in brain tissues at different reperfusion time points. Sig-1R expression increased with CIRI and decreased with increasing reperfusion times. After 24 hours of reperfusion, dexmedetomidine upregulated Sig-1R expression, and ER stress proteins (GRP78, CHOP, JNK and Caspase-3) were detected in brain tissues with Western blotting. Moreover, GRP78 expression followed a pattern similar to Sig-1R. Dexmedetomidine induced GRP78 expression but inhibited CHOP, Caspase-3 and phosphorylated-JNK expression in brain tissues. A Sig-1R-specific inhibitor reduced GRP78 expression and partially inhibited the upregulation of GRP78 by dexmedetomidine. The inhibitor also increased CHOP and Caspase-3 expression and partially reversed the inhibitory effects of dexmedetomidine on these pro-apoptotic ER stress proteins. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine at least partially inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating Sig-1R, thereby attenuating brain damage after 24 hours of ischemia-reperfusion.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we examined whether such non-enzymatic DNA repair can be effected by the common cellular antioxidant glutathione, investigating both permanent DNA damage products and the guanine radical intermediates that form them, using the flash-quench technique to carry out the one-electron oxidation of guanine. In gel-shift assays, the presence of reduced glutathione at physiological (millimolar) concentrations strongly inhibits oxidative DNA-protein cross-linking. In contrast, the oxidized glutathione dimer affords only a minimal amount of protection, even at elevated pH where there is more of the strongly reducing thiolate form. In flash photolysis experiments, the formation and decay of the guanine neutral radical were monitored at 510 nm. Transient absorption measurements with a guanine-rich 22-mer DNA duplex on the millisecond time scale show that the yield of this long-lived signal is significantly diminished in the presence of reduced glutathione, suggesting a reduction process that is fast relative to the measurement. Indeed, transient absorption experiments carried out on faster time scales show that the microsecond decay of the guanine radical signal is visibly faster with glutathione present. Glutathione is perhaps best known as an electron source in enzymatic reactions, to maintain cysteines in reduced states in proteins and to deactivate reactive oxygen species. However, these results show that another important task for glutathione may be to directly intercept DNA radicals before permanent DNA damage can occur.</AbstractText>"}

Among the 40 genes suggested in the NGS analysis, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) subunit alpha1 S (CACNA1S), VGCC auxiliary subunit beta 1 (CACNB1), and VGCC auxiliary subunit gamma 1 (CACNG1) were increased in the lamina propria of the old rats compared to the young rats. The synthesis of collagen I and III in hVFFs decreased after si-CACNA1S and verapamil treatment. The expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and -8 were increased in hVFFs after the treatment of verapamil. However, there was no change in the expression of MMP-2 and -9. These results suggest that some calcium channels may be related with the alteration of aging-related ECM in vocal folds.

We enrolled 669 CRC cases and 826 controls in this three-center case-control study in a Chinese Han population. All individuals were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Cross-over analysis, multivariate logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression analysis were used for analysis. In this study, CD44 rs187115 polymorphism was associated with increased risk for CRC. Stratified analyses revealed that CD44 rs187115 polymorphism was correlated with increased risk for CRC in females, drinkers, smokers, and those aged ≥ 60 years. In addition, rs187115 polymorphism was significantly associated with TNM III+IV stage, lymph node metastasis and tumor size in CRC patients. Combined effects of CD44 rs187115 polymorphism (GG/AG vs. AA) and environmental factors (smoking and drinking) further increased the risk of CRC. GG genotype carriers showed poorer overall survival than AA genotype carriers. Cox regression analysis showed that drinking, CD44 rs187115 polymorphism, and TNM stage were independent prognostic factors affecting CRC.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal microbiota in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not 'common' in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

As the prevalence of many of these disorders increases with the aging global population, there is an urgent need for disease-modifying drugs that will halt or slow the progression of these devastating diseases. A summary of the scientific information needed to guide the safe and effective use of a drug is provided in the product label in which the indication section should clearly state the treatment concept, e.g., distinguish between symptomatic, preventive, and curative treatments. However, a review of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) product labels for disease-modifying multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs reveals that the indications are not aligned with the regulatory guidance on labeling. Indication claims such as 'delay of accumulation of disability' and 'slowing of disease progression' were previously accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA); however, all recently approved MS drugs include no such specification of the treatment concept in the label indication sections despite similar clinical data packages supporting the approvals. Coincidently, the FDA and EMA therapeutic guidelines pertaining to development of drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders have changed from providing recommendations for specific disease modification label claims to a more general focus on the clinical development approach. Our analysis of MS drug labels could imply that the FDA and EMA may be unlikely to accept disease modification-related indication claims for drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders in general. We envision that a potential disease-modifying effect is more likely to be inferred from the label descriptions of the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy data and trial design, and target patient population. This poses a challenge for communication of the clinical benefit in a language that can be easily understood by patients and prescribers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Morant, Jagalski and Vestergaard.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Many of these findings, however, have not yet translated into new prognostic markers or rationales for treatments. We now know that AML is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by a very low mutational burden. Interestingly, the few mutations identified mainly reside in epigenetic regulators, which shape and define leukemic cell identity. In the light of these discoveries and given the increasing number of drugs targeting epigenetic regulators in clinical development and testing, great interest is emerging for the use of small molecules targeting leukemia epigenome. Together with their effects on leukemia cell-intrinsic properties, such as proliferation and survival, epigenetic drugs may affect the way leukemic cells communicate with the surrounding components of the tumor and immune microenvironment. Here, we review current knowledge on alterations in the AML epigenetic landscape and discuss the promises of epigenetic therapies for AML treatment. Finally, we summarize emerging molecular studies elucidating how epigenetic rewiring in cancer cells may as well exert immune-modulatory functions, boost the immune system, and potentially contribute to better patient outcomes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gambacorta, Gnani, Vago and Di Micco.</CopyrightInformation>"}

They are heterogeneous and inherently radio- and chemoresistant. They have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into non-BCSCs. These determinants of BCSCs including the plasticity between the mesenchymal and epithelial phenotypes often leads to minimal residual disease (MRD), tumor relapse, and therapy failure. By studying the resistance mechanisms in BCSCs, a combinatorial therapy can be formulated to co-target BCSCs and bulk tumor cells. This review addresses breast cancer stemness and molecular underpinnings of how the cancer stemness can lead to pharmacological resistance. This might occur through rewiring of signaling pathways and modulated expression of various targets that support survival and self-renewal, clonogenicity, and multi-lineage differentiation into heterogeneous bulk tumor cells following chemotherapy. We explore emerging novel and alternative molecular targets against BC stemness and chemoresistance involving survival, drug efflux, metabolism, proliferation, cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Strategic targeting of such vulnerabilities in BCSCs may overcome the chemoresistance and increase the longevity of the metastatic breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Sridharan, Howard, Tilley, Subramaniyan, Tiwari, Ruch and Raman.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of WDG in the diet of F1 Angus-Nellore cattle on meat quality characteristics, chemical composition and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. A hundred F1 Angus-Nellore bulls, with average initial body weight (BW) of 369.5 ± 49 kg were used. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design, and the animals were divided into two blocks (light and heavy) according to the initial body weight. The animals were fed diets containing levels of 0 (control), 15, 30 and 45% of WDG replacing dry corn and soybean meal. After 129 days of feedlot, the animals were slaughtered and samples of the <i>longissimus thoracis</i> (LT) muscle were collected for quality analyzes such as shear force (3, 10 and 17 aging days), color (luminosity, red, Chroma and Hue), cooking losses, pH and chemical composition (moisture, protein, lipids and ash contents). In addition, the expression of the <i>PPAR<i>α</i>, PPAR<i>γ</i>, SREBP-1c, SCD1, LPL, FABP4, FASN, ACOX, CPT2, GPX1</i> and <i>ACACA</i> genes was investigated in the LT muscle by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

There was no interaction (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) between aging times and the inclusion of WDG in the diets on the meat quality (pH, cooking losses, coloration and tenderness). However, diets with increasing levels of WDG caused a linear reduction (<i>P</i> = 0.01) in the intramuscular fat of LT. The lipogenic genes <i>SCD1, PPAR<i>γ</i>, FASN</i> and <i>CPT2</i> were less expressed (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) in response to the inclusion of WDG.

The dog, <i>Canis familiaris</i>, has already served as a valuable model of human physiology and disease. The possible role the dog could play in aging research is still an open question, although utilization of dogs may hold great promises as they naturally develop age-related cognitive decline, with behavioral and histological characteristics very similar to those of humans.

However, we lack a framework that adequately captures how these strategies vary among species. Observations from around the world now allow us to quantify the variation observed in commonly-measured fine-root traits but it is unclear how root traits are interrelated and whether they fall along an 'economic' spectrum of acquisitive to conservative strategies. We assessed root trait variation and mycorrhizal colonization rates by leveraging the largest global database of fine-root traits (the Fine-Root Ecology Database; FRED). We also developed a heuristic model to explore the role of mycorrhizal fungi in defining belowground exploration efficiency across a gradient of thin- to thick-diameter roots. In support of the expectations of the 'root economic spectrum,' we found that root diameter was negatively related to specific root length (Pearson's <i>r</i>=-0.76). However, we found an unexpected negative relationship between root diameter and root tissue density (Pearson's <i>r</i> = -0.40), and we further observed that root nitrogen content was largely unrelated to other economic traits. Mycorrhizal colonization was most closely associated with root diameter (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.62) and was unrelated to root tissue density and root nitrogen. The heuristic model demonstrated that while thinner roots have inherently greater capacity to encounter soil resources based on higher surface area per unit mass, the potential for increased associations with mycorrhizal fungi in thicker roots, combined with greater hyphal growth, can result in equally acquisitive strategies for both thin- and thick roots. Taken together, our assessments of root trait variation, trade-offs with mycorrhizal fungi, and broader connections to root longevity allowed us to propose a series of fundamental constraints on belowground resource acquisition strategies. Physical tradeoffs based on root construction (i.e., economic traits) and functional limitations related to the capacity of a root to encounter and acquire soil resources combine to limit the two-dimensional belowground trait space. Within this trait space there remains a diversity of additional variation in root traits that facilitates a wide range of belowground resource acquisition strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 McCormack and Iversen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The longest-lived example of a viable seed of known age is the date palm, <i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> L., of which an estimated 2000-year-old seed was germinated in 2005. Seed longevity is important for agriculture and biodiversity conservation, and understanding the basis for the extraordinary longevity of seeds from botanical collections could help improve seed banking technology. In this work, we studied the viability and structural features of date palm seeds collected in Baghdad in 1873 and stored in the Economic Botany Collection (EBC) at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and seeds collected in 2004 and stored dry at -20°C in the Millennium Seed Bank (MSB). Viability was studied by attempted seed germination and <i>in vitro</i> culture of embryos, and structural features were studied by X-rays, transmission electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. We found that the seeds preserved in the MSB did not decrease in viability, with ultrastructural features similar to those in freshly harvested seeds. In contrast, the 144-year-old seeds were dead, and large ultrastructural changes were observed, particularly in the storage lipids (size, distribution, and melting properties) and other storage constituents. These results contrast with previous reports that date seeds could remain viable for ∼2000 years in uncontrolled storage environments. We did not find that the postharvest treatment of the EBC seeds in the 19th century, or their storage conditions at Kew, was more deleterious than that which was likely encountered by the ∼2000-year-old seeds. These results highlight the role of well-documented collections in establishing whether reports of extraordinary longevity are ordinarily repeatable.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Porteous, Nesbitt, Kendon, Prychid, Stuppy, Conejero and Ballesteros.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here we review the recent findings of GC action in osteoporosis, inflammatory bone diseases (rheumatoid and osteoarthritis), and bone regeneration during fracture healing. We focus on studies of pre-clinical animal models that enable dissecting the role of GC actions in innate immune cells, stromal cells, and bone cells using conditional and function-selective mutant mice of the GC receptor (GR), or mice with impaired GC signaling. Importantly, GCs do not only directly affect cellular functions, but also influence the cross-talk between mesenchymal and immune cells, contributing to both beneficial and adverse effects of GCs. Given the importance of endogenous GCs as stress hormones and the wide prescription of pharmaceutical GCs, an improved understanding of GC action is decisive for tackling inflammatory bone diseases, osteoporosis, and aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ahmad, Hachemi, Paxian, Mengele, Koenen and Tuckermann.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Alterations in the early healing response due to an aged adaptive immune system leads to impaired bone repair, delayed healing or even formation of non-union. However, immuno-senescence is not limited to the adaptive immunity, but is also described for macrophages, main effector cells from the innate immune system. Beside regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling, macrophages contribute to angiogenesis and granulation tissue maturation. Thus, it seems likely that an altered macrophage function due to aging may affect bone repair at various stages and contribute to age related deficiencies in bone regeneration. To prove this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of macrophage markers and angiogenic factors in the early bone hematoma derived from young and aged osteotomized Spraque Dawley rats. We detected an overall reduced expression of the monocyte/pan-macrophage markers CD14 and CD68 in aged rats. Furthermore, the analysis revealed an impaired expression of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage markers in hematoma from aged animals that was connected to a diminished revascularization of the bone callus. To verify that the age related disturbed bone regeneration was due to a compromised macrophage function, CD14+ macrophage precursors were transplanted locally into the osteotomy gap of aged rats. Transplantation rescued bone regeneration partially after 6 weeks, demonstrated by a significantly induced deposition of new bone tissue, reduced fibrosis and significantly improved callus vascularization.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Löffler, Sass, Filter, Rose, Ellinghaus, Duda and Dienelt.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Several studies demonstrated that iron deposition was significantly related to the severity of symptoms in patients with depression. However, whether brain iron deposits influence depressive symptoms is so far unclear in the community of older adults. We measured iron deposition in deep intracranial nucleus by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and aimed to explore the relationship between iron deposition and depressive symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed the data of a community population from CIRCLE study, which is a single-center prospective observational study that enrolled individuals above 40 years old with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), while free of known dementia or stroke. We evaluated regional iron deposits on QSM, measured the volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and assessed depressive symptoms by Hamilton depression scale (HDRS). We defined depressive symptom as HDRS &gt; 7. <b>Results:</b> A total of 185 participants were enrolled. Participants in depressive symptom group had higher QSM value in thalamus than control group (18.79 ± 14.94 vs 13.29 ± 7.64, <i>p</i> = 0.003). The QSM value in the thalamus was an independent factor for the presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.055; 95% CI: 1.011-1.100; p = 0.013). The regional QSM values in other areas were not associated with HDRS score (all p &gt; 0.05). No significant correlations were observed between WMHs volume and HDRS score (p &gt; 0.05), or regional QSM values and WMHs volume (all p &gt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study demonstrated that iron deposits in the thalamus were related to the depressive symptoms in older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Zhou, Li, Xu, Yan, Cai, Jiaerken and Lou.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recently, scholars suggested that it may be more productive to ask when and <i>via</i> which mechanisms such effects are observed. Following, the current study examines if parental Holocaust-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are linked with the aging processes of their middle-aged offspring. Beyond this association, we also suggested a putative mediation path, indicating three underlying mechanisms by which parental trauma lingers on: perceived parent-child role reversal, secondary traumatization, and depressive symptoms. Using a convenience sample of 682 community-dwelling participants, comprising 341 older adult parent-middle-aged offspring dyads (<i>M</i> age = 81.71 and 54.58 for parents and offspring, respectively) to address this issue. Parents reported PTSD with the valid measure of PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition. OHS reported perceived parent-child role reversal, secondary traumatization, depressive symptoms, and completed indices of successful aging. Based on parents' reports, we divided the parent-offspring dyads into three groups: OHS whose parents had probable PTSD (<i>n</i> dyads = 43), OHS whose parents did not have PTSD (<i>n</i> dyads = 161), and comparison with parents who did not undergo the Holocaust (<i>n</i> dyads = 137). Findings reveal that OHS with parents suffering from probable PTSD aged less successfully than comparisons. Serial mediation analyses validated the aforementioned putative pathway (perceived parent-child role reversal, secondary traumatization, and depression) linking parental PTSD with offspring successful aging. Our findings are discussed through a vignette depicting a fictional OHS character. These underlying mechanisms suggest that different types of interventions, each geared towards a specific mechanism, may mitigate the lingering effect of parental PTSD on diminished OHS successful aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Hoffman and Shrira.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of age, body composition, and running speed with muscle strength and flexibility of recreational marathon runners. Male marathon runners (<i>n</i> = 130, age 44.1 ± 8.6 years, height 176 ± 6 cm, body mass 77 ± 9 body mass index 24.7 ± 2.6 kg.m<sup>-2</sup>, and race speed 10.29 ± 1.87 km/h) were separated into eight age groups (&lt;30, 30-35, 55-60, &gt;60 years). Four weeks before competing in a marathon, participants performed the sit-and-reach test (SAR), squat jumps (SJ), and countermovement jumps (CMJ), and four isometric muscle strength tests (right and left handgrip, lifting with knees extended and flexed), providing an index of overall isometric muscle strength in absolute (kg) relative to body mass values (kg.kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass). Afterward, participants competed and finished the Athens Classic Marathon (2017), and race speed was used as an index of running performance. As an average for the whole sample, SAR was 17.6 ± 8.5 cm, SJ was 24.3 ± 4.2 cm, CMJ was 25.8 ± 4.8 cm, overall isometric muscle strength was 386 ± 59 kg in absolute values and 5.06 ± 0.78 kg/kg of body mass in relative terms. The older age groups had the lowest scores in SJ (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.298) and CMJ (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.304), whereas no age-related difference in SAR (<i>p</i> = 0.908, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.022), absolute (<i>p</i> = 0.622, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.042) and relative isometric muscle strength (<i>p</i> = 0.435, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.055) was shown. Race speed correlated moderately with relative isometric strength (<i>r</i> = 0.42, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but not with the other neuromuscular measures (<i>r</i> &lt; 0.13,<i>p</i> &gt; 0.130). In summary, age-related differences were shown in jumping ability, but not in flexibility and isometric muscle strength. Although these parameters - except relative strength - did not relate to running speed, they were components of health-related physical fitness. Consequently, coaches and runners should consider exercises that include stretching and strengthening in their weekly program to ensure adequate levels for all components of health-related physical fitness.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Nikolaidis, Del Coso, Rosemann and Knechtle.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We have measured physiological and molecular parameters (differentiating high- and low responders) and their correlation with PA (sedentary status). Cluster analysis helped to distinguish individuals with high- or low PA and differentiate high- and low-responders of each parameter. The assessed cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, 6-min walking distance, relative VO<sub>2</sub>max), body composition parameters (body fat and muscle mass percentage) metabolic parameters (glucose, insulin, HDL, LDL), immune parameters (cortisol, CRP, lymphocyte counts, hTREC) all showed improvement. Artificial neural network analysis (ANN) showed correlation efficiencies of physiological and molecular parameters using a concept-free approach. ANN analysis appointed PA as the mastermind of molecular level changes. Besides sedentary status, insulin and hTREC showed significant segregation. Biostatistics evaluation also supported the schism of participants for their sedentary status, insulin concentration and hTREC copy number. In the future ANN and biostatistics, may predict individual responses to regular exercise. Our program reveals that high responder individuals of certain parameters may be low responders of others.

Ang II acts on Ang II type 1 receptors promoting sodium retention and vasoconstriction. However concurrently, the ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis and the expression of kallikrein and medullary prostaglandins counteract the effects of Ang II, promoting natriuresis and vasodilation. Human studies demonstrate that dietary potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) intake lowers blood pressure. In this report we evaluate the expression of AGT, ACE, medullary prorenin/renin, ACE2, kallikrein and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in Ang II-infused rats fed with high K<sup>+</sup> diet (2%) for 14 days. Dietary K<sup>+</sup> enhances diuresis in non-infused and in Ang II-infused rats. The rise in systolic blood pressure in Ang II-infused rats was attenuated by dietary K<sup>+</sup>. Ang II-infused rats showed increased renal protein levels of AGT, ACE and medullary prorenin and renin. This effect was attenuated in the Ang II + K<sup>+</sup> group. Ang II infusion decreased ACE2 compared to the control group; however, K<sup>+</sup> diet prevented this effect in the renal medulla. Furthermore, medullary COX-2 was dramatically induced by K<sup>+</sup> diet in non-infused and in Ang II infused rats. Dietary K<sup>+</sup> greatly increased kallikrein immunostaining in normotensive rats and in Ang II-hypertensive rats. These results indicate that a high K<sup>+</sup> diet attenuates Ang II-dependent hypertension by preventing the induction of ACE, AGT and collecting duct renin and by enhancing medullary COX-2 and ACE2 protein expression in the kidney.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gonzalez, Gallardo, Cespedes and Vio.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Cerovic, Forloni and Balducci.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Their adoption has triggered major advancements in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the past years. For instance, the analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging changes indicative of neuronal loss and amyloid deposition has led to the understanding that AD is characterized by a long preclinical phase. It is also supporting the transition towards a biology-grounded framework and definition of the disease. Nevertheless, though sufficient evidence exists about the <i>analytical validity</i> (i.e., accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility) of the candidate AD biomarkers, their <i>clinical validity</i> (i.e., how well the test measures the clinical features, and the disease or treatment outcomes) and <i>clinical utility</i> (i.e., if and how the test improves the patient's outcomes, confirms/changes the diagnosis, identifies at-risk individuals, influences therapeutic choices) have not been fully proven. In the present review, some of the methodological issues and challenges that should be addressed in order to better appreciate the potential benefits and limitations of AD biomarkers are discussed. The ultimate goal is to stimulate a constructive discussion aimed at filling the existing gaps and more precisely defining the directions of future research. Specifically, four main aspects of the clinical validation process are addressed and applied to the most relevant CSF biomarkers: (1) the definition of reference values; (2) the identification of reference standards for the disease of interest (i.e., AD); (3) the inclusion within the diagnostic process; and (4) the statistical process supporting the whole framework.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Canevelli, Bacigalupo, Gervasi, Lacorte, Massari, Mayer, Vanacore and Cesari.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is unclear if primary aging is associated with reductions in CVR because previous studies often include participants with vascular risk factors. Additionally, the inconsistency in the literature may be due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying intracranial cerebral blood flow and CVR. To address these limitations, we determined the effect of age on CVR in the large intracranial vessels in adults with low vascular risk using state-of-the-art MRI techniques. We also determined if the effect of age on CVR was sex-specific. Young (<i>n</i> = 20; 25 ± 3 years) and older (<i>n</i> = 19; 61 ± 5 years) healthy, physically active adults participated in the study. CVR was measured in response to hypercapnia using 4D flow MRI, which allows for simultaneous angiographic and quantitative blood flow measurements in the intracranial arteries. Older adults had lower global CVR and CVR in multiple intracranial arteries [right and left internal carotid arteries (ICA), right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA), and basilar artery (BA)] compared with young adults (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for all). In addition, the MCA dilated significantly in response to hypercapnia in young (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), but not older adults. Young men demonstrated higher global CVR and CVR in multiple intracranial arteries (ICAs, MCAs, and BA) compared with young women and older men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for both); however, CVR did not differ between young women and older women. Our results demonstrate that, using 4D flow MRI, primary aging is associated with lower CVR in adults with low vascular risk. In addition, the effect of age on CVR may be driven by men. The 4D flow MRI technique may provide a promising new alternative to measure cerebrovascular physiology without the limitations of commonly used techniques. Future studies could utilize this MRI technique to examine interventions to maintain CVR with advancing age.

In particular, this technique of simultaneously probing the whole brain has found high interest in monitoring brain wide effects of cerebral disease and in evaluating therapeutic strategies. Such studies, applied in preclinical experimental mouse models, often require long-term observations. In particular during regeneration studies, easily several months of continuous monitoring are required to detect functional improvements. These long periods of following the functional deficits during disease evolution as well as the functional recoveries during therapeutic interventions represent a substantial fraction of the life span of the experimental animals. We have therefore aimed to decipher the role of healthy aging alone for changes in functional neuronal networks in mice, from developmental adolescence <i>via</i> adulthood to progressing aging. For this purpose, four different groups of C57Bl6 mice of varying age between 2 and 13 months were studied twice with 4 weeks separation using resting state fMRI at 9.4T. Dedicated data analysis including both Independent Component Analysis (ICA) followed by seed-based connectivity matrix compilation resulted in an inverse U-shape curve of functional connectivity (FC) strength in both the sensorimotor and default mode network (DMN). This inverse U-shape pattern presented a distinct maximum of FC strength at 8-9 months of age, followed by a continuous decrease during later aging phases. At progressed aging at 12-13 months, the reduction of connectivity strength varied between 25% and 70% with most connectivities showing a reduction in strength by approximately 50%. We recommend that these substantial age-dependent changes in FC strength must be considered in future longitudinal studies to discriminate focused disease-based functional deficits and therapy-related functional improvements from underlying independent age effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Egimendia, Minassian, Diedenhofen, Wiedermann, Ramos-Cabrer and Hoehn.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We captured selective changes in task activation during the untrained tasks after task-switching training compared to an active control group. Results revealed changes at the neural level that were not evident from only behavioral data. Importantly, neural changes in the transient-sensitive context updating task were found on the same timescale but in a different region (i.e., in the left inferior parietal lobule) than in the task-switching training task (i.e., ventrolateral PFC, inferior frontal junction, superior parietal lobule), only pointing to temporal overlap, while neural changes in the sustained-sensitive delayed-recognition task overlapped in both timescale and region with the task-switching training task (i.e., in the basal ganglia), pointing to spatio-temporal overlap.

It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve of 98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs subjects which are high relative to single modality results and other state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, combined multimodal methods have improved the classification performance over the unimodal classification.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gupta, Lama, Kwon and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, its variability with respect to gender and age, particularly in the resting state, remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study we systematically investigated gender- and age-related differences in the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) seeded from core regions of this network, namely posterior mid-cingulate gyrus (pMCC), left amygdala, right anterior and left posterior insula, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), using a large cross-sectional adulthood sample. Results revealed that each of the seeded connectivity maps engaged in at least one of the large-scale brain networks including sensorimotor, attentional, basal ganglia, limbic, and default mode networks (DMN). In the early-adulthood stage, females had stronger negative rsFC in pMCC and right anterior INS (aINS) with the medial DMN than males, possibly reflecting their greater suppression of the sympathoexcitation associated with sex hormonal estrogen. Whereas in the late-adulthood stage, they showed stronger positive rsFC in pMCC with postcentral gyrus and weaker negative rsFC with the most DMN, possibly relating to their higher risk of depression, anxiety, and dementia than males after menopause. Moreover, females demonstrated reduced negative rsFC in pMCC with dorsal PCUN/PCC and left AG with advancing age, whereas males showed the opposite pattern, namely increased positive rsFC, in pMCC with right SMG, and in vmPFC with ventral PCUN. We interpret these results as their differences of altered autonomic regulation associated with pain experience and reflective movement, respectively, due to aging. In sum, our findings add in literature that autonomic responses can be also represented intrinsically in the resting brain, and gender- and age-related differences might be associated with sex hormones and sensorimotor abilities, respectively.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Sie, Chen, Shiau and Chu.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The underlying neural correlates have remained speculative however, in spite of known white matter degradation seen in conjunction with elevated inconsistency in related operationalizations of intraindividual variability. Consistently, these operationalizations have controlled for artifactual age-related variance to increase measurement sensitivity of CNS dysfunction. In this study, dispersion was examined alongside composite scores of memory and executive functioning from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Forty-four healthy older adults (<i>M</i> = 72.0, <i>SD</i> = 6.4) underwent Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological testing spanning a range of cognitive domains. The results replicated previous findings, demonstrating reduced microstructural integrity with advanced age and increased integrity in high memory and executive functioning performers, across all major white matter tracts. With age first regressed from the composite scores, significant associations remained between greater executive functioning scores and greater microstructural integrity in the genu of the corpus callosum, right anterior corona radiata, anterior, posterior and rentrolenticular parts of right internal capsule, as well as right posterior thalamic radiation. With age regressed from the dispersion scores, greater values were primarily associated with decreased white matter integrity in the body and genu of corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata bilaterally and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Dispersion is easily computed across speeded and accuracy-based measures and shows promise in detecting white matter damage, beyond that seen in the typical aging process. This appears to be the first investigation of neural correlates associated with increased dispersion.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Halliday, Gawryluk, Garcia-Barrera and MacDonald.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Aging also impacts processes involved in online language comprehension, including the ability to form integrated, message-level representations. These changes in comprehension processes could impact older adults' associative memory performance, perhaps by reducing or altering the effectiveness of encoding strategies that encourage semantic integration. The present study examined age differences in the use of a strategy termed conceptual combination, which involves integrating two words (e.g., 'winter' and 'salad') into a single concept ('a salad for winter'). We recorded ERPs while participants studied unrelated noun pairs using a strategy that either did or did not encourage conceptual combination. We also varied the concreteness of the first noun in each pair in order to measure compositional concreteness effects, or ERP differences at the second noun due to the concreteness of the first noun. At the first nouns, older adults showed word-level concreteness effects that were similar to those of younger adults. However, compositional concreteness effects were diminished in older adults, consistent with reduced semantic integration. Older adults' associative memory performance was better for word pairs studied during the conceptual combination task versus the non-combinatory encoding task; however, the magnitude of the age-related associative memory deficit did not differ between tasks. Finally, analyses of both memory accuracy and trial-by-trial ratings of perceived combination success suggested that older adults had disproportionate difficulty applying the conceptual combination strategy to word pairs that began with abstract nouns. Overall, these results indicate that changes to integrative language processing that occur with age are not independent of - and may sometimes exacerbate - age-related memory decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Lucas, Gupta, Hubbard and Federmeier.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, it has been unclear what contributions the different parts of the vestibular system - the semi-circular canals and otoliths - make to these processes. The advent of mutant otolith-deficient mice has made it possible to isolate the relative contributions of the otoliths, the utricle and saccule. A number of studies have now indicated that the loss of otolithic function impairs normal spatial memory and also impairs the normal function of head direction cells in the thalamus and place cells in the hippocampus. Epidemiological studies have also provided evidence that spatial memory impairment with aging, may be linked to saccular function. The otoliths may be important in spatial cognition because of their evolutionary age as a sensory detector of orientation and the fact that velocity storage is important to the way that the brain encodes its place in space.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Smith.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We investigate the structural and functional plasticity of auditory neurons in response to various auditory experiences during development, adulthood, and aging. Using electrophysiology, computer simulation, and immunohistochemistry, we study the structural plasticity of the axon initial segment (AIS) in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) from the auditory brainstem of the mice (either sex), in different ages and auditory environments. The structure and spatial location of the AIS of MNTB neurons depend on their functional topographic location along the tonotopic axis, aligning high- to low-frequency sound-responding neurons (HF or LF neurons). HF neurons dramatically undergo structural remodeling of the AIS throughout life. The AIS progressively shortens during development, is stabilized in adulthood, and becomes longer in aging. Sound inputs are critically associated with setting and maintaining AIS plasticity and tonotopy at various ages. Sound stimulation increases the excitability of auditory neurons. Computer simulation shows that modification of the AIS length, location, and diameter can affect firing properties of MNTB neurons in the developing brainstem. The adaptive capability of axonal structure in response to various auditory experiences at different ages suggests that sound input is important for the development and maintenance of the structural and functional properties of the auditory brain throughout life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Kim, Feng, Santamaria and Kim.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Currently, three of four AD drugs act by inhibiting the acetylcholine (ACh) degrading enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Efficacy of these drugs depends on available amount of ACh, which is biosynthesized by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). We investigated whether treatment with a cholinesterase-inhibitor, galantamine, alters the relative levels of AChE to ChAT in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether levels of these CSF biomarkers correlate with <i>in vivo</i> AChE activity and nicotinic binding sites in the brain assessed by positron emission tomography (PET). Protein concentrations and activities of ChAT and AChE were measured in CSF of 18 patients with mild AD prior to and after 3 months of treatment with galantamine (<i>n</i> = 12) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 6), followed by nine additional months of galantamine treatment in all patients. A Cholinergic index was defined as the ratio of ChAT to AChE in CSF and was evaluated in relation to the <i>in vivo</i> AChE activity, the nicotinic binding sites and different measures of cognition. Besides an expected inhibition of AChE activity, galantamine treatment was accompanied by a mild increase in CSF ChAT activity. Thereby, the Cholinergic index was significantly increased in the <i>Galantamine group</i> (60% ± 14) after 3 months compared to baseline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0023) or (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0004). This index remained high in <i>the Galantamine group</i> compared to baseline (54% ± 11) at 12 months follow-up, while it showed an increase in <i>the Placebo group</i> when they switched to active galantamine treatment (44% ± 14 vs. baseline, 61% ± 14 vs. 3 months, all <i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the <i>in vivo</i> brain AChE activity (assessed by PET) correlated with the CSF Cholinergic index at 12 months (<i>r</i> = 0.98, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The CSF Cholinergic index also correlated with ADAS-Cog and some other neuropsychological tests at 12 months. This is the first study assessing a CSF Cholinergic index in relation to treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor. The treatment-specific increase in CSF ChAT activity suggests that cholinesterase-inhibitors may also increase the ACh-biosynthesis capacity in the patients. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of the CSF Cholinergic index as a biomeasure of therapeutic effect in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Karami, Eriksdotter, Kadir, Almkvist, Nordberg and Darreh-Shori.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Older dropouts had lower memory performance and higher dementia risk, and hyper-activated right anterior and posterior hippocampus during memory encoding. During encoding, the dropouts also activated right prefrontal regions that instead were active during retrieval in younger and older remainers. Moreover, the dropouts showed altered frontal-hippocampal functional connectivity, notably elevated right PFC to anterior hippocampus (aHC) connectivity during encoding.

We measured concentration changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin and differential effects in 18 healthy adults during sustained attention and working memory performance, before and after laser of the right prefrontal cortex.

Sham control data served to rule out that the laser effects were due to pre-post task repetition or other non-specific effects.

The pathogenesis of brain impairment caused by chronic hyperglycemia is complex and includes mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters' alteration, and vascular disease, which lead to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic plasticity, brain aging, and dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut released hormone, is attracting attention as a possible link between metabolic and brain impairment. Several studies have shown the influence of GPL-1 on neuronal functions such as thermogenesis, blood pressure control, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, retinal repair, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, modulation of GLP-1 activity can influence amyloid β peptide aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dopamine (DA) levels in Parkinson's disease (PD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) showed beneficial actions on brain ischemia in animal models, such as the reduction of cerebral infarct area and the improvement of neurological deficit, acting mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They might also exert a beneficial effect on the cognitive impairment induced by diabetes or obesity improving learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides this, there are growing evidences on neuroprotective effects of these agonists in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, regardless of diabetes. In PD animal models, GPL-1RAs were able to protect motor activity and dopaminergic neurons whereas in AD models, they seemed to improve nearly all neuropathological features and cognitive functions. Although further clinical studies of GPL-1RAs in humans are needed, they seem to be a promising therapy for diabetes-associated cognitive decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Grieco, Giorgi, Gentile, d’Erme, Morano, Maras and Filardi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The device consists of a dual-drive stimulator equipped with two pneumatic cylinders, which are separately programed to apply pressure waveforms to the entire foot sole. In a sample of nine healthy younger adults, the pressure curve applied to the foot sole closely correlated with that experienced during over ground walking (<i>r</i> = 0.811 ± 0.043, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01).

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal microbiota induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health <i>via</i> IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty acid into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

The properties of young and old erythrocytes differ with young erythrocytes being functionally much more versatile than old erythrocytes, which have higher haemoglobin content. Factors which affect the formation and breakdown of erythrocytes are reviewed. Erythropoiesis in fish is largely similar to that in mammals. However, definitive erythrocytes are mainly formed in the anterior part of the kidney, and erythropoietin is secreted mainly from the heart. Senescence of erythrocytes in fish has not been studied in detail, and consecutively the factors causing aging of erythrocytes in man are discussed. A major factor causing aging of erythrocytes is oxidative stress, which is also a major effect of toxicants on fish erythrocytes. Consequently, apparent age distribution of circulating erythrocytes will be affected by environmental pollution. At present, it is completely unknown, if the changes in age distribution of erythrocytes play a role in pollutant responses or if the age distribution of erythrocytes is actively regulated during environmental adaptation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The segregation of chromosomes is driven by interactions between spindle microtubules and kinetochores. Kinetochores in mammalian oocytes are subjected to special challenges: they need to withstand microtubule pulling forces over multiple hours and are built on centromeric chromatin that in humans is decades old. In meiosis I, sister kinetochores are paired and oriented toward the same spindle pole. It is well established that they progressively separate from each other with advancing female age. However, whether aging also affects the internal architecture of centromeres and kinetochores is currently unclear. Here, we used super-resolution microscopy to study meiotic centromere and kinetochore organization in metaphase-II-arrested eggs from three mammalian species, including humans. We found that centromeric chromatin decompacts with advancing maternal age. Kinetochores built on decompacted centromeres frequently lost their integrity and fragmented into multiple lobes. Fragmentation extended across inner and outer kinetochore regions and affected over 30% of metaphase-II-arrested (MII) kinetochores in aged women and mice, making the lobular architecture a prominent feature of the female meiotic kinetochore. We demonstrate that a partial cohesin loss, as is known to occur in oocytes with advancing maternal age, is sufficient to trigger centromere decompaction and kinetochore fragmentation. Microtubule pulling forces further enhanced the fragmentation and shaped the arrangement of kinetochore lobes. Fragmented kinetochores were frequently abnormally attached to spindle microtubules, suggesting that kinetochore fragmentation could contribute to the maternal age effect in mammalian eggs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This study presents a more accessible method for researchers to optimise sclera material parameters for use in finite element studies where macroscale sclera displacements are required. Five human donor sclerae aged between 36 and 72 years were subjected to cycles of internal pressure up to 61 mmHg using a custom-built inflation rig. Displacements were measured using a laser beam and two cameras through a digital image correlation algorithm. Specimen-specific finite element models incorporating regional thickness variation and sclera surface topography were divided into six circumferential regions. An inverse finite element procedure was used to optimise Ogden material parameters for each region. The maximum root mean squared (RMS) error between the numerical and experimental displacements within individual specimens was 17.5 µm. The optimised material parameters indicate a gradual reduction in material stiffness (as measured by the tangent modulus) from the equator to the posterior region at low-stress levels up to 0.005 MPa. The variation in stiffness between adjacent regions became gradually less apparent and statistically insignificant at higher stresses. The study demonstrated how inflation testing combined with inverse modelling could be used to effectively characterise regional material properties capable of reproducing global sclera displacements. The material properties were found to vary between specimens, and it is expected that age could be a contributing factor behind this variation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, quantifying trailing limb propulsion requires sophisticated measurement equipment at significant expense that fundamentally limits clinical translation for diagnostics or gait rehabilitation. As a component of joint power, our purpose was to determine if shank acceleration estimated via accelerometers during push-off can serve as a clinically feasible surrogate for ankle power output and peak anterior ground reaction forces (GRF) during walking. As hypothesized, we found that young adults modulated walking speed via changes in peak anterior GRF and peak ankle power output that correlated with proportional changes in shank acceleration during push-off, both at the individual subject (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.80, p &lt; 0.01) and group average (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.74, p &lt; 0.01) levels. In addition, we found that unilateral deficits in trailing limb propulsion induced via a leg bracing elicited unilateral and relatively proportional reductions in peak anterior GRF, peak ankle power, and peak shank acceleration. These unilateral leg bracing effects on peak shank acceleration correlated with those in peak ankle power (braced leg: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43, p = 0.028) but those effects in both peak shank acceleration and peak ankle power were disassociated from those in peak anterior GRF.

Here, we attempted to ameliorate the age-related decline in HSC function by modulating Bmi1 expression. The forced expression of Bmi1 did not attenuate myeloid-biased differentiation of aged HSCs. However, single cell transplantation assays revealed that the sustained expression of Bmi1 augmented the multi-lineage repopulating capacity of aged HSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs.

We aimed to determine whether ECMO in adults hospitalized with cardiac arrest is associated with improved survival compared with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a nationally representative sample. The U.S. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2006 to 2014) was utilized to identify a cohort of adults hospitalized with cardiac arrest at ECMO-capable facilities (defined by the presence of at least 1 ECMO procedure at the facility during the study period of 2006 to 2014). In-hospital mortality was compared between the ECMO and non-ECMO groups using generalized estimating equations with and without coarsened exact matching analysis. Of 273,690 hospitalizations for adults with cardiac arrest, 33,274 occurred at 363 ECMO-capable facilities, of which 775 (2.3%) involved the use of ECMO. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between patients who received ECMO versus those who did not (60.1% vs 57.2%, p = 0.106). In the risk-adjusted analysis, the presence of ECMO was associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality in the overall sample [odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 1.85] and the coarsened exact matching sample (n = 1,068 with 534 adults in each group; odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.88). In this cohort of hospitalizations for cardiac arrest at ECMO-capable centers in the U.S., adults who received ECMO had significantly higher mortality than those who did not receive ECMO.

Only a few amino acid changes in the haemagglutinin on the surface of avian influenza viruses (AIV) can cause a switch from avian to human receptor specificity, and the individuals with pathognostic chronic diseases might be more susceptible to AIV due to the decreased expression level of terminal α2-3-linked SA in their saliva. Here, using lectin and virus histochemical staining, we observed the higher expression levels of α2-3/6-linked SA influenza virus receptors in the airway of HBV-transgenic mice compared with that of control mice due to the significant decrease in control mice during ageing, which imply that this is also a risk factor for individuals with pathognostic chronic diseases susceptible to influenza viruses.

Being the major, if not only, cellular bulk-degradation mechanism, macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) declines with age in multiple tissues and organisms. Spermidine is an endogenous polyamine metabolite that also declines with age. It prolongs lifespan and improves tissue functions of model organisms in an autophagy-dependent manner. We report that autophagic flux is significantly reduced in B cells from old mice. Spermidine induces autophagy and improves the function of both old mouse and old human B cells. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies (hypusinates) the translation factor EIF5A. Hypusinated EIF5A specifically regulates the synthesis of the master autophagy and lysosome transcription factor, TFEB (transcription factor EB).

Administration of HcEAE significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and lowered the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in brains and sera of mice in a dose-dependent manner. A histopathology assessment indicated that the HcEAE could ameliorate the anile condition of the model mice. These results suggest that the HcEAE has potent antioxidant activity and could minimize the occurrence of age-associated disorders associated with free radicals.</AbstractText>"}

Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapeutic agents are widely used treatment options, in addition to minimally invasive new therapeutical approaches developed in the past decade. Unfortunately, we are still a long way from preventing mortality due to urological cancers or to achieving long-term progression-free disease control. Extensive research in recent years has established the presence of a relatively small population of cancer stem cells, which may be targeted to reach these goals. Mounting evidence points to the role of CSCs in metastasis, treatment resistance, and recurrence. In this chapter, we review the presence of CSCs in bladder, prostate, and kidney cancers with emphasis on their identification and clinical relevance.</AbstractText>"}

One of the first immune cell types to encounter danger is the macrophage. Macrophages sense danger signals such as extracellular ATP or bacterial toxins, derived from tissue damage or infection, and initiate the activation of an intracellular molecular complex called the inflammasome. The inflammasome consists of a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, an adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and the protease caspase-1. Assembly of the complex leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1 that triggers processing and release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, and ultimately cell death via the process of pyroptosis. The ability to sense and respond to danger appropriately is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of inflammasomes contributes to the progression of chronic diseases prevalent in the ageing population, such as Alzheimer's disease, COPD and metabolic disease; hence, it is critical that activation of the inflammatory response and inflammasome activation are tightly regulated. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as ubiquitination have recently emerged as important regulators of inflammasome assembly. However, the mechanisms by which PTMs regulate the inflammasome are still not understood. This review aims to summarize our knowledge to date on how the ubiquitin system controls inflammasome activation and where this area of research is heading.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Strong evidence demonstrates that age-related cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction and consequential impairment of NVC responses contribute importantly to cognitive decline. Recent studies demonstrate that NAD<sup>+</sup> availability decreases with age in the vasculature and that supplemental NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors can ameliorate cerebrovascular dysfunction, rescuing NVC responses and improving cognitive performance in aged mice. The mechanisms underlying the age-related decline in [NAD<sup>+</sup>] in cells of the neurovascular unit are likely multifaceted and may include increased utilization of NAD<sup>+</sup> by activated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of PARP-1 activity may confer protective effects on neurovascular function in aging, similar to the recently demonstrated protective effects of treatment with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). To test this hypothesis, 24-month-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with PJ-34, a potent PARP inhibitor, for 2 weeks. NVC was assessed by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) in the somatosensory whisker barrel cortex evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that NVC responses were significantly impaired in aged mice. Treatment with PJ-34 improved NVC responses by increasing endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation, which was associated with significantly improved spatial working memory. PJ-34 treatment also improved endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced relaxation of aorta rings. Thus, PARP-1 activation, likely by decreasing NAD<sup>+</sup> availability, contributes to age-related endothelial dysfunction and neurovascular uncoupling, exacerbating cognitive decline. The cerebromicrovascular protective effects of pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 highlight the preventive and therapeutic potential of treatments that restore NAD+ homeostasis as effective interventions in patients at risk for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI).</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we use a patient-specific fluid structure interaction AVG model to assess whether AVG haemodynamics and mechanical loading can be optimised by using novel electrospun polyurethane (ePU) grafts, since their compliance can be better tuned to match that of the native veins, compared to gold standard, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts.

Yet few studies have examined the effects of exposure to protests on population well-being even though such exposure may have profound and lasting effects, especially if experienced at critical stages of development over the life course. The aim of our study is to estimate the effects of exposure to political protests on the human capital accumulation and well-being of youth during the tumultuous political transition experienced in Egypt from 2011 to 2014. For a nationally representative panel of youth captured in the 2009 and 2013/2014 waves of the Survey of Young People in Egypt (SYPE), we exploit exogenous geospatial variation in the occurrence of political protests from the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data (ACLED) Project to estimate individual-level changes in social trust, uncertainty, education, and health outcomes for youth exposed to protests. In our panel, 31.1% of the sample lived in districts where riots or protests occurred. Exposure to protests increased overall perceptions of uncertainty about the future. Young men ever exposed to protests were slightly more likely to report good overall health, but experienced sizable worsening in mental health compared to young women ever exposed. Differences by own and family participation in protest events were found for perceptions of uncertainty and mental health. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring and other mass protest movements around the globe, these findings highlight the importance of examining the population-level impacts of different forms of political conflict, particularly as substantial numbers of youth in Middle East and North Africa and elsewhere progress to adulthood under conditions of political instability.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Among them, kaempferol has been reported to assist bone formation in vitro and in vivo, but its precise mechanism of action for stimulating bone forming abilities of osteoblasts remained elusive. In SaOS-2 osteoblasts, treatment of kaempferol increased early and late osteogenic parameters significantly, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen synthesis, and mRNA expression levels of Runx2, osterix, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Interestingly, kaempferol promoted osteoblastic differentiation via the activation of the WNT signaling pathway. The stimulation of SaOS-2 cells by kaempferol resulted in an increased activity of WNT signaling responsive reporter construct, Axin-2, and, subsequently, stabilization of WNT signaling mediated transcription factor β-catenin, probably leading to the activation of WNT-targeted genes for osteogenesis. In corroboration, the kaempferol-induced ALP activity was fully abolished by FH 535, an inhibitor of WNT signaling pathway. Kaempferol mediated activation of WNT signaling pathway through estrogen signaling pathway, as the application of ICI 182,780 (an inhibitor for estrogen receptors) markedly inhibited kaempferol-induced WNT signaling activation and osteogenic marker like ALP activity in SaOS-2 cells. Immunohistochemical studies in drill-hole defect model showed increased expression of Runx2 and β-catenin staining after kaempferol treatment. Thus, it may be concluded that kaempferol stimulates estrogen signaling followed by WNT signaling pathway activation to achieve its potential for bone-sparing effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In order to effectively develop new targets for osteoporosis, a preclinical model of the age-related loss in fracture resistance needs to be established beyond known age-related decreases in bone mineral density and bone volume fraction. To that end, we examined long bones of male and female BALB/c mice at 6-mo. and 20-mo. of age and assessed whether material and matrix properties of cortical bone significantly differed between the age groups. The second moment of area of the diaphysis (minimum and maximum principals for femur and radius, respectively) as measured by ex vivo micro-computed tomography (μCT) was higher at 20-mo. than at 6-mo. for both males and females, but ultimate moment as measured by three-point bending tests did not decrease with age. Cortical thickness was lower with age for males, but higher for old females. Partially accounting for differences in structure, material estimates of yield, ultimate stress, and toughness (left femur) were 12.6%, 11.1%, and 40.9% lower, respectively, with age for both sexes. The ability of the cortical bone to resist crack growth (right femur) was also 18.1% less for the old than for the young adult mice. These decreases in material properties were not due to changes in intracortical porosity as pore number decreased with age. Rather, age-related alterations in the matrix were observed for both sexes: enzymatic and non-enzymatic crosslinks by high performance liquid chromatography increased (femur), volume fraction of bound water by <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry decreased (femur), cortical tissue mineral density by μCT increased (femur and radius), and an Amide I sub-peak ratio I<sub>1670</sub>/I<sub>1640</sub> by Raman spectroscopy increased (tibia).

Furthermore, most people with type 2 diabetes are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72 h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28 mM glucose, 200 µM palmitic acid, and 200 µM oleic acid as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on insulin secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and insulin secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased insulin secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of insulin secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type 2 diabetes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with high penetrance and often exhibit working memory deficits coupled with degeneration of LC-NE neurons early in the progression of AD pathology. Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are chemogenetic tools that allow targeted manipulation of discrete neuronal populations in the brain without the confounds of off-target effects. We utilized male Ts65Dn mice (a mouse model for DS), and male normosomic (NS) controls to examine the effects of inhibitory DREADDs delivered via an AAV vector under translational control of the synthetic PRSx8, dopamine β hydroxylase (DβH) promoter. This chemogenetic tool allowed LC inhibition upon administration of the inert DREADD ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). DREADD-mediated LC inhibition impaired performance in a novel object recognition task and reversal learning in a spatial task. DREADD-mediated LC inhibition gave rise to an elevation of α-adrenoreceptors both in NS and in Ts65Dn mice. Further, microglial markers showed that the inhibitory DREADD stimulation led to increased microglial activation in the hippocampus in Ts65Dn but not in NS mice. These findings strongly suggest that LC signaling is important for intact memory and learning in Ts65Dn mice and disruption of these neurons leads to increased inflammation and dysregulation of adrenergic receptors.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

This review is focused on phytocompounds (PHYTOCs)-based cosmeceuticals, an established segment of cosmetic industry, due to the great demand for vitamins and plant-derived products. PHYTOCs beauty and health-related applications are due to their anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, wound-healing, anti-aging, sun protection, cytoprotective, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. However, PHYTOCs present disadvantages, precisely the poor solubility, instability, reduced skin permeation and low skin retention time, which strongly restrict their topical application. Therefore, and since the cosmetic industry constantly pursues groundbreaking technological products, nanotechnology emerges as an innovative strategy to tackle the PHYTOCs recognized limitations. Nanotechnology manipulates and reduces materials size to 1 and 100 nm, creating structures able to encapsulate active ingredients, such as PHYTOCs, with the purpose of overcoming their limitations and delivering them in a controlled manner to the skin. This review highlights the potential properties of PHYTOCs loaded in several types of nanocarriers (liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, transferosomes, cubosomes, phytosomes, nanoemulsions, nanocrystals, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and dendrimers) used to overcome PHYTOCs free form limitations and potentiate their cosmeceutical properties. An approach to the 'green' chemical synthesis of metallic nanoparticles taking advantage of PHYTOCS as natural reducing agents is exposed as well.

To interpret the cortical reconstruction and the motor improvement after the middle trunk transfer, we explored the distribution of CSNs connecting to the middle, upper, and lower trunk of the brachial plexus by retrograde trans-neuronal tracing using pseudorabies virus (PRV-EGFP or PRV-mRFP).

We sought to determine the association between PFC based WM processing and LTM in the visuospatial domain. In contrast to prior work, we aimed to query if WM was involved in learning and free recall trials as measured by standard neuropsychological tests of LTM. Forty-three older adults (24 with a diagnosis of amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and 19 elderly controls) were included in the analysis. Patients completed a fMRI task of visuospatial maintenance WM in which they were required to match a previously studied complex shape with one of two probes. Extent of activity in the right PFC during the WM task was tabulated for each patient. Hippocampal volume was quantified from T1 scans. On a separate day patients completed neuropsychological testing, including the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test- Revised (BVMT-R), which includes learning trials (total recall), delayed free recall, and recognition. Right PFC activity was associated with performance on BVMT-R total recall and delayed recall.

Emerging evidence suggests that the desmosomal adhesion protein Desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) functions beyond the desmosomal adhesion and plays a role in regulating the fundamental pathways that govern cell fate decisions in response to environmental chemical and mechanical stresses. In this study, we explored the role of Dsg3 on dome formation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in MDCK cells, a kidney epithelial cell model widely used to study cell differentiation and tight junction formation and integrity. We show that overexpression of Dsg3 constrained nuclear ROS production and cellular doming in confluent cell cultures and these features coincided with augmented TER and enhanced tight junction integrity. Conversely, cells expressing dominant-negative Dsg3ΔC mutants exhibited heightened ROS production and accelerated doming, accompanied by increased apoptosis, as well as cell proliferation, with massive disruption in F-actin organization and accumulation, and alterations in tight junctions. Inhibition of actin polymerization and protein synthesis was able to sufficiently block dome formation in mutant populations. Taken together, these findings underscore that Dsg3 has a role in controlling cellular viability and differentiation as well as the functional integrity of tight junctions in MDCK cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Most aortic aneurysms evolve from mechanosignaling deregulation, converging to impaired vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) force-generating capacity accompanied by synthetic phenotype switch. However, little is known on VSMC mechanoresponses in MFS pathophysiology. Here, we investigated traction force-generating capacity in aortic VSMC cultured from 3-month old mg∆<sup>lpn</sup> MFS mice, together with morpho-functional and proteomic data. Cultured MFS-VSMC depicted marked phenotype changes vs. wild-type (WT) VSMC, with overexpressed cell proliferation markers but either lower (calponin-1) or higher (SM alpha-actin and SM22) differentiation marker expression. In parallel, the increased cell area and its complex non-fusiform shape suggested possible transition towards a mesenchymal-like phenotype, confirmed through several markers (e.g. N-cadherin, Slug). MFS-VSMC proteomic profile diverged from that of WT-VSMC particularly regarding lower expression of actin cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins. Accordingly, MFS-VSMC displayed lower traction force-generating capacity and impaired contractile moment at physiological substrate stiffness, and markedly attenuated traction force responses to enhanced substrate rigidity. Such impaired mechanoresponses correlated with decreased number, altered morphology and delocalization of focal adhesions, as well as disorganized actin stress fiber network vs. WT-VSMC. In VSMC cultured from 6-month-old mice, phenotype changes were attenuated and both WT-VSMC and MFS-VSMC generated less traction force, presumably involving VSMC aging, but without evident senescence. In summary, MFS-VSMC display impaired force-generating capacity accompanying a mesenchymal-like phenotype switch connected to impaired cytoskeleton/focal adhesion organization. Thus, MFS-associated TAAD involves mechanoresponse impairment common to other TAAD types, but through distinct mechanisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The current study examined whether such a mechanism was also engaged during retrieval of real-world negative events. In a scanned autobiographical memory task, 56 participants (ages 18-83) were presented with images associated with the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. Images fell into three categories: primarily positive, primarily negative, and mixed-valence. Participants retrieved a personal memory associated with each image, elaborated on that memory in as much detail as possible, and rated memory positivity and memory negativity. Unlike in recent episodic memory studies, young and older adults did not differ in how prefrontal regions contributed to retrieval of autobiographical memories associated with primarily negative images. However, there was an age-related reversal in the role of dorsomedial prefrontal recruitment during retrieval of autobiographical memories associated with mixed-valence images: Activity was associated with increased negativity ratings in young adults and decreased negativity in older adults. These findings are the first evidence that older adults engage a prefrontally-mediated mechanism at the time of retrieval to reduce the negativity of memories for real-world emotional events, and further suggest that they may only do so in the case of emotional ambiguity. Such a mechanism could have important implications for understanding how older adults may respond to and evaluate negative events in their daily lives.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, we focused on 13 different disease traits and on 2 longevity definitions: length of productive life (LPL) and stayability (STAY). The LPL was defined as the interval in days from first calving to culling. For LPL, we considered 90,215 cows with known culling dates. For binary STAY, we defined 3 survival stages in the first 3 lactations: from calving to DIM 59, from DIM 60 to DIM 299, and from DIM 300 to the next calving date. Due to the earlier trait recording possibilities, 129,386 cows were considered for the STAY analysis. Accordingly, the presence or absence of diseases in lactation stages were defined as binary traits. A further data set for the 90,215 cows with a culling date included the subjective culling reasons defined by farmers. Comparison of culling reasons, as defined by farmers, with diagnoses from the disease data set indicated some disagreements. For example, only 18.71% of the cows with the farmer culling reason 'metabolic diseases' were diagnosed with a metabolic disorder. Better agreements were identified for mastitis (84.09%). Phenotypically, in most cases, occurrence of diseases at different lactation stages had negative influence on LPL and STAY. In this regard, we identified strong detrimental effects of clinical mastitis and of metabolic disorders from early lactation stages on longevity traits. For example, the presence of clinical mastitis in the first stage of first lactation was associated with LPL decrease of 95.35 d. Using generalized linear mixed models for binary health disorders, heritabilities ranged from &lt;0.01 (±0.079 standard error) for ruminal acidosis early in first, second, and third lactation to 0.24 (±0.039) for interdigital hyperplasia from the last stage in third lactation. Heritabilities from single-trait and bivariate animal models ranged from 0.03 (±0.003) to 0.10 (±0.007) for LPL, and from 0.01 (±0.002) to 0.06 (±0.007) for STAY. Genetic correlations between longevity traits and health disorders were mostly negative (i.e., favorable in a breeding sense). For improvements to longevity genetic evaluations for young bulls with a limited number of daughter culling dates, we suggest consideration of health traits from a well-organized co-operator herd monitoring system as early longevity predictors, especially for censored data. Genetic correlations between mastitis from different lactation stages with LPL and STAY ranged from -0.28 (±0.07) to -0.69 (±0.05), and from -0.26 (±0.08) to -0.77 (±0.08), respectively. Interestingly, only diagnoses for dermatitis digitalis showed opposite results phenotypically and genetically. Strong genetic associations between ruminal acidosis and STAY were observed (genetic correlations: -0.48 ± 0.18 to -0.98 ± 0.31), supporting the inferred phenotypic associations. Genetic correlations between longevity traits LPL and STAY were quite large, between 0.77 (±0.11) and 0.94 (±0.02) for the different lactation stages, suggesting utility of early STAY information when attempting genetic improvements for longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

In particular, age-dependent androgens deficiency causes cognitive impairments. Several enzymes like protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in memory deficiency. Indeed, PKC regulatory process mediates α-secretase activation to cleave APP in β-amyloid cascade and tau proteins phosphorylation mechanism.  Androgens and cortisol regulate PKC signaling pathways, affecting the modulation of receptor for activated C kinase 1. Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK signaling pathway depends on CREB activity in hippocampal neurons and is involved in regulatory processes via PKC and androgens. Therefore, testosterone and PKC contribute in the neuronal apoptosis. The present review summarizes the current status of androgens, PKC, and their influence on cognitive learning. Inconsistencies in experimental investigations related to this fundamental correlation are also discussed, with emphasis on the mentioned contributors as the probable potent candidates for learning and memory improvement.</AbstractText>"}

As a result of the growth of the older population, it is expected that an increasing number of older people will need treatment. Depression can be effectively treated-but fewer than half of those who are affected receive treatment. Barriers to receiving treatment are lack of resources and trained healthcare providers, social stigma, incorrect diagnoses and long distances to treatment facilities. There is an increased need for alternative ways of treating patients with depression. The use of video consultations has shown to be a viable option for delivering mental health care to older patients. Use of video consultations allows patients to receive treatment in their own homes. None of the existing reviews have focused on satisfaction with the use of video consultations amongst older people with depression. This paper provides knowledge regarding the use of video consultations, especially for older people with depression. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: No previous review has sought to understand the use of video consultations in mental health care to older patients with depression. The results show that video consultations support mental health practice, especially as a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible. An initial scepticism from participants quickly disappeared when video consultations were experienced in action. The challenges associated with the use of video consultations seem to consist of technical problems and lack of support from staff. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health practitioners should consider the use of video consultations because it can support mental health practice, especially as a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible. ABSTRACT: Introduction Depression is the leading cause of mental illness amongst an ageing population and fewer than half of those who are affected receive treatment. There is an increased need for alternative ways of treating patients; the use of video consultations has been shown to be a viable option for delivering mental health care. However, none of the existing reviews have focused on satisfaction with the use of video consultations amongst older people with depression and providers. Aim To conduct a systematic review of the existing literature focusing on patients' and providers' experiences of video consultations for depression. Method Eight scientific databases were searched. In all, 3,537 articles were identified and, of these, 21 peer-reviewed articles were included in this review. Results The results show that video consultations support mental health practice, especially as a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible. Any initial scepticism quickly disappeared when video consultations were experienced in action. The challenges seem to consist of technical problems and lack of support from staff. Discussion The experiences and satisfaction of older people with depression seem to be positive, although methodological limitations and deficiencies of the reviewed articles should be considered. More qualitative research is needed, and future studies should focus on specific diagnoses and providers' experiences. Implications for practice Video consultations support mental health practice, especially as a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We assessed the individual and joint predictive performance of methylation, GRS, and environmental risk factors for BC incidence in a prospective cohort study. In a cohort of 5462 women aged 50-75 from Germany, 101 BC cases were identified during 14 years of follow-up and were compared to 263 BC-free controls in a nested case-control design. Three previously suggested methylation risk scores (MRSs) based on methylation of 423, 248, and 131 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) loci, and a GRS based on the risk alleles from 269 recently identified single nucleotide polymorphisms were constructed. Additionally, multiple previously proposed environmental risk scores (ERSs) were built based on environmental variables. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were estimated for evaluating BC risk prediction performance. MRS and ERS showed limited accuracy in predicting BC incidence, with AUCs ranging from 0.52 to 0.56 and from 0.52 to 0.59, respectively. The GRS predicted BC incidence with a higher accuracy (AUC = 0.61). Adjusted odds ratios per standard deviation increase (95% confidence interval) were 1.07 (0.84-1.36) and 1.40 (1.09-1.80) for the best performing MRS and ERS, respectively, and 1.48 (1.16-1.90) for the GRS. A full risk model combining the MRS, GRS, and ERS predicted BC incidence with the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.64) and might be useful for identifying high-risk populations for BC screening.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we aimed at characterizing the initial events in the molecular pathogenesis of T-PLL and particularly, at determining the point in T-cell differentiation when the hallmark oncogenic events, that is, inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) and t(X;14)(q28;q11) occur. To this end, we mined whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data of 17 and 11 T-PLL cases, respectively. Mapping of the 14q32.1 locus breakpoints identified only TCL1A, which was moreover significantly overexpressed in T-PLL as compared to benign CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, as the only common oncogenic target of aberrations. In cases with t(14;14), the breakpoints mapped telomeric and in cases with inv(14) centromeric or in the 3'-untranslated region of TCL1A. Regarding the T-cell receptor alpha (TRA) locus-TCL1A breakpoint junctions, all 17 breakpoints involved recombination signal sequences and 15 junctions contained nontemplated (N-) nucleotides. All T-PLL cases studied carried in-frame TRA rearrangements on the intact allele, which skewed significantly toward usage of distal/central TRAV/TRAJ gene segments as compared to the illegitimate TRA rearrangements. Our findings suggest that the oncogenic TRA-TCL1A/MTCP1 rearrangements in T-PLL occur during opening of the TRA locus, that is, during the progression from CD4+ immature single positive to early double positive thymocyte stage, just before physiologic TCL1A expression is silenced. The cell carrying such an oncogenic event continues maturation and rearranges the second TRA allele to achieve a functional T-cell receptor. Thereafter, it switches off RAG and DNTT expression in line with the mature T-cell phenotype at presentation of T-PLL.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Indeed, observations across mammalian studies have revealed the existence of longevity and health disparities between sexes, including in humans (i.e. with a female or male advantage). However, the underlying mechanisms for these sex differences in health and lifespan remain poorly understood, and it is unclear which aspects of this dimorphism stem from hormonal differences (i.e. predominance of estrogens vs. androgens) or from karyotypic differences (i.e. XX vs. XY sex chromosome complement). In this review, we discuss the state of the knowledge in terms of sex dimorphism in various aspects of aging and in human age-related diseases. Where the interplay between sex differences and age-related differences has not been explored fully, we present the state of the field to highlight important future research directions. We also discuss various dietary, drug or genetic interventions that were shown to improve longevity in a sex-dimorphic fashion.

Short peptides had geroprotective properties and stimulated stem cell differentiation. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the role of AEDG and KED peptides in maintaining oral hMSCs morphology and functions over long-term expansion. 2 types of hMSCs were investigated: human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPLSCs) and human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs). Cells at the 25th passage were divided into 3 groups: 1 - control (without adding peptide), 2 - treated with AEDG peptide, 3 - treated with KED peptide. Cell cultures were analyzed by an immunofluorescence method and RT-PCR on the p16 and p21 senescence markers expression. AEDG peptide decreased p16 and p21 mRNA expression by 1.56-2.44 times in comparison with the control group. KED peptide decreased p16 and p21 mRNA expression by 1.82-3.23 times in comparison with the control group. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescent visualization. AEDG and KED peptides could be used as supplementary substances in a culture medium to delay the expression of senescence markers in long term stem cell cultivation in order to promote the large-scale in vitro expansion necessarily required for stem cell therapy clinical application.

NVC is a critical homeostatic mechanism in the brain, responsible for adjustment of local cerebral blood flow to the energetic needs of the active neuronal tissue. Recent progress in geroscience has led to the identification of critical cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in neurovascular aging, identifying these pathways as targets for intervention. In order to translate the preclinical findings to humans, there is a need to assess NVC in geriatric patients as an endpoint in clinical studies. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that enables the investigation of local changes in cerebral blood flow, quantifying task-related changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations.

Increasing evidence, however, demonstrates that LDs fulfill a pleiotropy of additional functions. Among them is the modulation of protein as well as lipid homeostasis. Under unfavorable pro-oxidative conditions, proteins can form aggregates which may exceed the overall proteolytic capacity of the proteasome. After stress termination LDs can adjust and support the removal of these aggregates. Additionally, LDs interact with mitochondria, specifically take over certain proteins and thus prevent apoptosis. LDs, which are loaded with these harmful proteins, are subsequently eliminated via lipophagy. Recently it was demonstrated that this autophagic process is a modulator of longevity. LDs do not only eliminate potentially dangerous proteins, but they are also able to prevent lipotoxicity by storing specific lipids. In the present study we used the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to compare the proteome as well as lipidome of mitochondria and LDs under different conditions: replicative aging, stress and apoptosis. In this context we found an accumulation of proteins at LDs, supporting the role of LDs in proteostasis. Additionally, the composition of main lipid classes such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerols, triacylglycerols, ceramides, phosphatidic acids and ergosterol of LDs and mitochondria changed during stress conditions and aging.</AbstractText>"}

Four-, 8-, and 16-month-old rats, with or without 40% CR for a duration of 14 weeks, were sacrificed after an overnight fasting. Total protein content and the phosphorylation level of AKT, mTOR, S6K, and 4EBP1 and protein content of key markers in the UPP (FOXO3a, atrogin, MuRF1, ubiquitinated proteins, proteasome subunits alpha 7 and beta 5) were determined. Unlike younger rats, CR decreased the content of phosphorylated mTOR, S6K, phosphorylated S6K, FOXO3a, and ubiquitinated proteins in middle-aged rats. In conclusion, CR-induced reduction of content/ phosphorylation levels of key proteins in mTOR signaling and the UPP occurred in the middle-aged rats but not younger rats. The age-dependent effects of CR on mTOR signaling and the UPP indirectly explained the age-related effects of CR on muscle mass of animals.</AbstractText>"}

For specific stem cell types, distinctive nutritional and signaling components are required to maintain the proliferation capacity and differentiation potential in cell culture. Various vitamins play essential roles in stem cell culture to modulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Besides their common nutritional functions, specific vitamins are recently shown to modulate signal transduction and epigenetics. In this article, we will first review classical vitamin functions in both somatic and stem cell cultures. We will then focus on how stem cells could be modulated by vitamins beyond their nutritional roles. We believe that a better understanding of vitamin functions will significantly benefit stem cell research, and help realize their potentials in regenerative medicine.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated to what extent gene expression profiling of nasal brushings is similar to that of bronchial brushings. We performed genome wide gene expression profiling on matched nasal and bronchial epithelial brushes from 77 respiratory healthy individuals. To investigate differences and similarities among regulatory modules, network analysis was performed on correlated, differentially expressed and smoking-related genes using Gaussian Graphical Models. Between nasal and bronchial brushes, 619 genes were correlated and 1692 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate &lt;0.05, |Fold-change|&gt;2). Network analysis of correlated genes showed pro-inflammatory pathways to be similar between the two locations. Focusing on smoking-related genes, cytochrome-P450 pathway related genes were found to be similar, supporting the concept of a detoxifying response to tobacco exposure throughout the airways. In contrast, cilia-related pathways were decreased in nasal compared to bronchial brushes when focusing on differentially expressed genes. Collectively, while there are substantial differences in gene expression between nasal and bronchial brushes, we also found similarities, especially in the response to the external factors such as smoking.</AbstractText>"}

Neuronal autophagy is particularly important, as it affects the development and function of the nervous system, and is heavily implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Nonetheless, how autophagy is regulated in neurons remains poorly understood. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we demonstrate that the primary initiator of autophagy, the UNC-51/ULK kinase, is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1. RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase activity restricts UNC-51 and autophagosome formation within specific axonal compartments, and exerts effects broadly across the nervous system. By restraining UNC-51 activity, RPM-1 inhibits autophagosome formation to affect axon termination, synapse maintenance and behavioral habituation. These results demonstrate how UNC-51 and autophagy are regulated subcellularly in axons, and unveils a mechanism for restricting initiation of autophagy across the nervous system. Our findings have important implications beyond nervous system development, given growing links between altered autophagy regulation and neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>"}

In the case of metallic glasses, this general behavior across different temperatures and alloys has been used to establish an empirical universal superposition principle of time, waiting time, and temperature. Here we demonstrate that the application of a mechanical stress within the elastic regime breaks this universality. Using in-situ x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) experiments, we show that strong fluctuations between slow and fast structural dynamics exist, and that these generally exhibit larger relaxation times than in the unstressed case. On average, relaxation times increase with stress magnitude, and even preloading times of several days do not exhaust the structural dynamics under load. A model Lennard-Jones glass under shear deformation replicates many of the features revealed with XPCS, indicating that local and heterogeneous microplastic events can cause the strongly non-monotonous spectrum of relaxation times.</AbstractText>"}

Local cellular senescence together with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) are the main contributors to inflamm-aging. However, little is known about their involvement in diabetic periodontitis. Gingiva is the first line of host defense in the periodontium, and macrophages are key SASP-carrying cells. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism by which hyperglycemia drives the inflamm-aging in the gingival tissue of diabetic mice and macrophages. We demonstrated that hyperglycemia increased the infiltrated macrophage senescence in gingival tissue of diabetic mice. Simultaneously, hyperglycemia elevated the local burden of senescent cells in gingival tissue and induced the serum secretion of SASP factors <i>in vivo</i> Moreover, <i>in vitro</i>, high glucose induced macrophage senescence and SASP factors secretion through phosphorylation of NLRC4, which further stimulated the NF-κB/Caspase-1 cascade via an IRF8-dependent pathway. Deletion of NLRC4 or IRF8 abolished hyperglycemia-induced cellular senescence and SASP in macrophages. In addition, we found that treatment with metformin inhibited NLRC4 phosphorylation and remarkably decreased cellular senescence and SASP in the context of hyperglycemia. Our data demonstrated that hyperglycemia induces the development of inflamm-aging in gingival tissue and suggested that NLRC4 is a potential target for treatment of diabetes-associated complications.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Zhang et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

After behavioral phenotyping (grip strength, beam walking and rotarod tests), autophagy (LC3-II/actin) and oxidative stress were tested in the cerebral cortex and gastrocnemius muscle. The latter parameter was indirectly assessed by evaluating carbonyl groups added to proteins as a result of oxidative reactions, in addition to central levels of NRF2 protein, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes. In comparison with sex-matched controls, trehalose-treated males performed better in motor planning and coordination tasks. This behavioral phenotype was associated with an activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy and antioxidant defences in cerebral cortex. Independently from trehalose administration, females were characterized by better motor performance and showed higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins and NRF2 in cerebral cortex, suggesting an up-regulation of basal antioxidant defences.

Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma where the treatment paradigm is focused on managing IOP using medications, laser, or surgery regimens. However, notwithstanding IOP and other clinical parameters, patient-reported outcomes, including daily functioning, emotional well-being, symptoms, mobility, and social life, remain the foremost concerns for people being treated for glaucoma. These outcomes are measured using objective patient-centered outcome measures (PCOMs) and subjective patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Studies using PCOMs have shown that people with glaucoma have several mobility, navigational and coordination challenges; reading and face recognition deficits; and are slower in adapting to multiple real-world situations when compared to healthy controls. Similarly, studies have consistently demonstrated, using PROMs, that glaucoma substantially and negatively impacts on peoples' self-reported visual functioning, mobility, independence, emotional well-being, self-image, and confidence in healthcare, compared to healthy individuals, particularly in those with late-stage disease undergoing a heavy treatment regimen. The patient-centred effectiveness of current glaucoma treatment paradigms is equivocal due to a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials; short post-treatment follow-up periods; an inappropriate selection or availability of PROMs; and/or an insensitivity of currently available PROMs to monitor changes especially in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage glaucoma. We provide a comprehensive, albeit non-systematic, critique of the psychometric properties, limitations, and recent advances of currently available glaucoma-specific PCOMs and PROMs. Finally, we propose that item banking and computerized adaptive testing methods can address the multiple limitations of paper-pencil PROMs; customize their administration; and have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for people with glaucoma.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously reported that urocortin 2 (Ucn2) gene transfer increases heart function in mice with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Here, we test the hypotheses that (1) Ucn2 gene transfer will increase LV function in aged mice and that (2) Ucn2 gene transfer given in early life will prevent age-related LV dysfunction. Nineteen-month-old (treatment study) and 3-month-old (prevention study) mice received Ucn2 gene transfer or saline. LV function was examined 3-4 months (treatment study) or 20 months (prevention study) after Ucn2 gene transfer or saline injection. In both the treatment and prevention strategies, Ucn2 gene transfer increased ejection fraction, reduced LV volume, increased LV peak -dP/dt and peak +dP/dt, and reduced global longitudinal strain. Ucn2 gene transfer-in both treatment and prevention strategies-was associated with higher levels of LV SERCA2a protein, reduced phosphorylation of LV CaMKIIa, and reduced LV α-skeletal actin mRNA expression (reflecting reduced cardiac stress). In conclusion, Ucn2 gene transfer restores normal cardiac function in mice with age-related LV dysfunction and prevents development of LV dysfunction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Mouse models which express DPRs at repeat lengths found in human disease are urgently required to investigate this. We aimed to generate transgenic mice expressing DPRs at repeat lengths of &gt;1000 using alternative codon sequences, to reduce the repetitive nature of the insert. We found that although these inserts did integrate into the mouse genome, the alternative codon sequences did not protect from instability between generations. Our findings suggest that stable integration of long DPR sequences may not be possible.

Here, we report the first study of aging transition in mixed active and inactive fractional-order oscillators. It has been demonstrated that while the heterogeneity is caused by the distance parameter, both the coupling strength and the fractional-order derivative can modulate the critical ratio at which aging transition occurs. In addition, a small fractional-order derivative may ruin the ability of oscillation and, thus, reduce the critical ratio in globally coupled fractional-order Stuart-Landau oscillators. Remarkably, the larger the natural frequency is the more easily the aging transition occurs in coupled fractional-order oscillators. Further studies have shown that, being diverse from an integer-order Stuart-Landau oscillator, the natural frequency may induce a Hopf bifurcation in a fractional-order Stuart-Landau oscillator, accordingly, introducing a new heterogeneity in the coupled fractional-order Stuart-Landau oscillators. Therein, a counterintuitive phenomenon has been found that the critical ratio depends unmonotonously on the coupling strength, which implies that the coupled fractional-order Stuart-Landau oscillators possess the weakest robustness of oscillation at a certain level of coupling strength.</AbstractText>"}

We retrospectively identified seven MM-type sCJD cases with both fine vacuole-type spongiform (FV) and large confluent vacuole-type spongiform change (LCV) among 49 sCJD cases. We reviewed clinical features, pathological findings, and radiological abnormalities in these seven cases. We also conducted a regional systemic study with five brains to associate the spongiform-change pattern with hyperintensity on magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using the signal intensity index (SII). In the case series study, the one patient with dominant LCV showed longer disease duration, later onset of typical symptoms, no periodic sharp wave complexes in electroencephalography, and negative 14-3-3 protein findings compared to the six FV-dominant patients. LCV-dominant lesions tended to show higher intensity on DWI than did the FV-dominant lesions in respective patients. In the regional systemic study, LCV-dominant regions showed significantly higher SII on DWI than did the FV-dominant regions. In conclusion, mixed MM-type sCJD generally showed the clinical features of the phenotype that was dominant in pathological distribution.

Recently, interest in therapeutically targeting senescence to improve healthy aging and age-related disease, otherwise known as senotherapy, has been growing rapidly. Thus, the accurate detection of senescent cells, especially in vivo, is essential. Here, we present a consensus from the International Cell Senescence Association (ICSA), defining and discussing key cellular and molecular features of senescence and offering recommendations on how to use them as biomarkers. We also present a resource tool to facilitate the identification of genes linked with senescence, SeneQuest (available at http://Senequest.net). Lastly, we propose an algorithm to accurately assess and quantify senescence, both in cultured cells and in vivo.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as reliable cell sources for stem cell transplantation and are currently being tested in numerous clinical trials. However, the effects of autophagy on MSC senescence and corresponding mechanisms have not been fully evaluated. Several studies demonstrated that autophagy level increases in aging MSCs and the downregulation of autophagy can delay MSC senescence, which is inconsistent with most studies that showed autophagy could play a protective role in stem cell senescence. To further study the relationship between autophagy and MSC senescence and explore the effects and mechanisms of premodulated autophagy on MSC senescence, we induced the up- or down-regulation of autophagy by using rapamycin (Rapa) or 3-methyladenine, respectively, before MSC senescence induced by D-galactose (D-gal). Results showed that pretreatment with Rapa for 24 hours remarkably alleviated MSC aging induced by D-gal and inhibited ROS generation. p-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p-38 expression were also clearly decreased in the Rapa group. Moreover, the protective effect of Rapa on MSC senescence can be abolished by enhancing the level of ROS, and p38 inhibitor can reverse the promoting effect of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> on MSC senescence. In summary, the present study indicates that autophagy plays a protective role in MSC senescence induced by D-gal, and ROS/JNK/p38 signalling plays an important mediating role in autophagy-delaying MSC senescence.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women aged 60 to 85 years were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error &lt; 5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (aged 75.4 ± 5.9 years, body mass index [BMI] 29.5 ± 5.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B = 84.08 [27.56], p = 0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B = 129.17 [55.96], p = 0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension, and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Seed longevity is a key trait in agriculture, which directly influences seed germination and ultimately determines crop productivity and hence food security. Numerous studies have demonstrated that seed deterioration is regulated by complex interactions between diverse endogenous genetically controlled factors and exogenous environmental cues, including temperature, relative humidity, and oxygen partial pressure during seed storage. The endogenous factors, including the chlorophyll concentration, the structure of the seed coat, the balance of phytohormones, the concentration of reactive oxygen species, the integrity of nucleic acids and proteins and their associated repair systems, are also involved in the control of seed longevity. A precise understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying seed longevity is becoming a hot topic in plant molecular biology. In this review, we describe recent research into the regulation of seed longevity and the interactions between the various environmental and genetic factors. Based on this, the current state-of-play regarding seed longevity regulatory networks will be presented, particularly with respect to agricultural seed storage, and the research challenges to be faced in the future will be discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this work we investigate the expression of age-related changes in the whole-body image. A large dataset of about 32,000 subjects scanned from neck to knee and aged 44-82 years from the UK Biobank study was used for a machine-based analysis. We trained a convolutional neural network based on the VGG16 architecture to predict the age of a given subject based on image data from these scans. In 10-fold cross-validation on 23,000 of these images the network reached a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.49 years (R2=0.83) and showed consistent performance on a separate test set of another 8,000 images. On a second test set of 100 images the network outperformed the averaged estimates given by three experienced radiologists, which reached an MAE of 5.58 years (R2=0.08), by more than three years on average. In an attempt to explain these findings, we employ saliency analysis that opens up the image-based criteria used by the automated method to human interpretation. We aggregate the saliency into a single anatomical visualization which clearly highlights structures in the aortic arch and knee as primary indicators of age.</AbstractText>"}

Extant subfield segmentation protocols have been based on neuroanatomical references, but these references often give limited information on anatomical variability. Moreover, there is generally a mismatch between the orientation of the histological sections and the often anisotropic coronal sections on in vivo MRI. To address these issues, we provide a detailed description of hippocampal anatomy using a postmortem dataset containing nine specimens of subjects with and without dementia, which underwent a 9.4 T MRI and histological processing. Postmortem MRI matched the typical orientation of in vivo images and segmentations were generated in MRI space, based on the registered annotated histological sections. We focus on the following topics: the order of appearance of subfields, the location of subfields relative to macroanatomical features, the location of subfields in the uncus and tail and the composition of the dark band, a hypointense layer visible in T2-weighted MRI. Our main findings are that: (a) there is a consistent order of appearance of subfields in the hippocampal head, (b) the composition of subfields is not consistent in the anterior uncus, but more consistent in the posterior uncus, (c) the dark band consists only of the CA-stratum lacunosum moleculare, not the strata moleculare of the dentate gyrus, (d) the subiculum/CA1 border is located at the middle of the width of the hippocampus in the body in coronal plane, but moves in a medial direction from anterior to posterior, and (e) the variable location and composition of subfields in the hippocampal tail can be brought back to a body-like appearance when reslicing the MRI scan following the curvature of the tail.

White matter hyperintensity (WMH), a common sign of WM vascular damage in the elderly, is closely related to slower psychomotor processing speed. In this study, we investigated the association between WMH and psychomotor speed changes through a comprehensive assessment of brain structural and functional features. Multi-modal MRIs were acquired from 60 elderly adults. Psychomotor processing speeds were assessed using the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A). Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between TMT-A and brain features, including WMH volumes in five cerebral regions, diffusivity parameters in the major WM tracts, regional gray matter volume, and brain activities across the whole brain. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to demonstrate the contribution of each index to slower psychomotor processing speed. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that WMH volume in the occipital lobe and fractional anisotropy of the forceps major, an occipital association tract, were associated with TMT-A. Besides, resting-state brain activities in the visual cortex connected to the forceps major were associated with TMT-A. Hierarchical regression showed fractional anisotropy of the forceps major and regional brain activities were significant predictors of TMT-A. The occurrence of WMH, combined with the disruption of passing-through fiber integrity and altered functional activities in areas connected by this fiber, are associated with a decline of psychomotor processing speed. While the causal relationship of this WMH-Tract-Function-Behavior link requires further investigation, this study enhances our understanding of these complex mechanisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

MDD patients have a significantly impaired quality of life and reduced life expectancy compared to unaffected individuals, the latter being largely accounted for by an increased incidence of suicide and cardiovascular disorders. The premature mortality observed in MDD has been considered a signature of accelerated aging, a hypothesis supported by data showing altered functioning and morphology of several brain regions that are typically present in the aging population. Telomere shortening is a hallmark of cellular aging, and as such several studies explored the involvement of disrupted telomere dynamics in MDD, reporting contrasting findings. In the current study, we measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in a sample of 54 MDD patients and 47 non-psychiatric controls characterized for response to antidepressant treatment. After correcting for age, sex, and body mass index, we showed significantly reduced LTL in affected individuals compared to controls (beta = -.22, p = .02). There was no difference in LTL between treatment resistant or responsive MDD patients. Moreover, we observed no correlation between lifetime exposure to antidepressants and LTL. Our study showed that MDD patients have shorter telomeres compared to controls, supporting the hypothesis of accelerated aging in this disorder. However, LTL seemed not to be influenced by antidepressant treatment or to correlate with clinical response to these antidepressants. Further investigations in larger samples and possibly with longitudinal design are warranted to elucidate the role of altered telomere dynamics in MDD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is therefore timely to consider multi-morbidity in PKU and the effects of ageing, in parallel with the wider benefits of emerging treatment options in addition to dietary relaxation. We have conducted the first literature review of co-morbidity and ageing in the context of PKU. Avenues explored have emerged from limited study of multi-morbidity to date and the knowledge and critical enquiry of the authors. Findings suggest PKU to have a wider impact than brain development, and result in several intriguing questions that require investigation to attain the best outcomes for people with PKU in adulthood moving through to older age. We recognise the difficulty in studying longitudinal outcomes in rare diseases and emphasise the necessity to develop PKU registries and cohorts that facilitate well-designed studies to answer some of the questions raised in this review.

This may not be the case, however, for omnivorous predators, which are at risk of extended exposure to systemically applied pesticides through ingestion while feeding on treated plants for nutrients or water. Such exposure may kill or have sublethal consequences for these natural enemies, compromising their role as biocontrol agents of agricultural pest species. The spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae: Asopinae), is an important zoophytophagous biocontrol agent (i.e., able to substitute zoophagy by phytophagy for survival) that may be exposed to systemic insecticides in many agricultural systems. We, therefore, examined effects on P. maculiventris following exposure to cabbage plants subject to soil-drench treatments with imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide. Predator survival, development, body weight, and reproduction were recorded. Imidacloprid significantly affected nymph survival and adult emergence, but not duration of the nymphal period or adult body weight. At one-twentieth the recommended field rate for whitefly and aphid management, imidacloprid treatments reduced longevity, fecundity, and fertility of female predators. These findings demonstrate that soil treatments with systemic insecticide can negatively impact zoophytophagous natural enemies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The MCAdv deficit was positively associated with the center of pressure displacement vector-average using repeated-measures correlation (repeated-measures correlation coefficient = 0.56, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). An a posteriori analysis identified a sub-group of participants that showed an exaggerated increase in MCAdv deficit and greater postural instability in both the anterior-posterior (<i>P</i> = 0.002) and medial-lateral (<i>P</i> = 0.021) directions in response to the interventions. These findings support the theory that individuals who experience greater initial cerebral hypoperfusion on standing may be at a greater risk for falls.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Dizziness and risk for falls after standing might link directly to reduced delivery of oxygen to the brain. By introducing challenges that increased the drop in brain blood flow in healthy young adults, we have shown for the first time a direct link to greater postural instability. These results point to a need to measure cerebral blood flow and/or oxygenation after postural transitions in populations, such as older adults, to assist in fall risk assessment.</AbstractText>"}

Possible explanations include the lack of quantitative and validated biomarkers, the subjective nature of many clinical endpoints, and complex pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships, but also the possibility that highly selective drugs in the CNS do not reflect the complex interactions of different brain circuits. Although computational systems pharmacology modeling designed to capture essential components of complex biological systems has been increasingly accepted in pharmaceutical research and development for oncology, inflammation, and metabolic disorders, the uptake in the CNS field has been very modest. In this article, a cross-disciplinary group with representatives from academia, pharma, regulatory, and funding agencies make the case that the identification and exploitation of CNS therapeutic targets for drug discovery and development can benefit greatly from a system and network approach that can span the gap between molecular pathways and the neuronal circuits that ultimately regulate brain activity and behavior. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), convened a workshop to explore and evaluate the potential of a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) approach to CNS drug discovery and development. The objective of the workshop was to identify the challenges and opportunities of QSP as an approach to accelerate drug discovery and development in the field of CNS disorders. In particular, the workshop examined the potential for computational neuroscience to perform QSP-based interrogation of the mechanism of action for CNS diseases, along with a more accurate and comprehensive method for evaluating drug effects and optimizing the design of clinical trials. Following up on an earlier white paper on the use of QSP in general disease mechanism of action and drug discovery, this report focuses on new applications, opportunities, and the accompanying limitations of QSP as an approach to drug development in the CNS therapeutic area based on the discussions in the workshop with various stakeholders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Our understanding of the regulation and function of these organelles is of great interest to scientists and clinicians across many disciplines within our healthcare system. Skeletal muscle is a useful model tissue for the study of mitochondrial adaptations because of its mass and contribution to whole body metabolism. The remarkable plasticity of mitochondria allows them to adjust their volume, structure and capacity under conditions such as exercise, which is useful or improving metabolic health in individuals with various diseases and/or advancing age. Mitochondria exist within muscle as a functional reticulum which is maintained by dynamic processes of biogenesis and fusion, and is balanced by opposing processes of fission and mitophagy. The sophisticated coordination of these events is incompletely understood, but is imperative for organelle function and essential for the maintenance of an interconnected organelle network that is finely tuned to the metabolic needs of the cell. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial turnover in muscle could offer potential therapeutic targets for the advancement of health and longevity among our ageing populations. As well, investigating exercise modalities that are both convenient and capable of inducing robust mitochondrial adaptations are useful in fostering more widespread global adherence. To this point, exercise remains the most potent behavioural therapeutic approach for the improvement of mitochondrial health, not only in muscle, but potentially also in other tissues.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Opposition to gun rights requires organization, attention, and political activity, whereas visible support for gun rights can be as simple as owning a firearm; the expression of advocacy for this issue is inherently asymmetric. This paper presents seven decades of persistent national polling (N = 79,608) alongside Congressional voting records that portray steady partisan divergence and asymmetric support slowly shifting towards gun rights, away from gun control.

Epigenetics describes mechanisms of (heritable) regulation of gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetics is strongly related to aging, is cell-type specific, and includes DNA methylation, noncoding RNAs, and histone modifications.<b>Areas covered</b>: This review summarizes recent epigenetic studies of childhood asthma in humans, which mostly involve studies of DNA methylation published in the recent five years. Environmental exposures, in particular cigarette smoking, have significant impact on epigenetic changes, but few of these epigenetic signals are also associated with asthma. Several asthma-associated genetic variants relate to DNA methylation. Epigenetic signals can be better understood by studying their correlation with gene expression, which revealed higher presence and activation of blood eosinophils in asthma. Strong associations of nasal methylation signatures and atopic asthma were identified, which were replicable across different populations.<b>Expert commentary</b>: Epigenetic markers have been strongly associated with asthma, and might serve as biomarker of asthma. The causal and longitudinal relationships between epigenetics and disease, and between environmental exposures and epigenetic changes need to be further investigated.

Polyanions promote prion aggregation in vitro, yet the cofactors that modulate prion assembly in vivo remain largely unknown. Here we report that the endogenous glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS), impacts prion propagation kinetics and deposition sites in the brain. Exostosin-1 haploinsufficient (Ext1<sup>+/-</sup>) mice, which produce short HS chains, show a prolonged survival and a redistribution of plaques from the parenchyma to vessels when infected with fibrillar prions, and a modest delay when infected with subfibrillar prions. Notably, the fibrillar, plaque-forming prions are composed of ADAM10-cleaved prion protein lacking a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, indicating that these prions are mobile and assemble extracellularly. By analyzing the prion-bound HS using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we identified the disaccharide signature of HS differentially bound to fibrillar compared to subfibrillar prions, and found approximately 20-fold more HS bound to the fibrils. Finally, LC-MS of prion-bound HS from human patients with familial and sporadic prion disease also showed distinct HS signatures and higher HS levels associated with fibrillar prions. This study provides the first in vivo evidence of an endogenous cofactor that accelerates prion disease progression and enhances parenchymal deposition of ADAM10-cleaved, mobile prions.</AbstractText>"}

This study assesses the effects of temperature over hatching success, oncomiracidia longevity, and infection success. The experimental design consisted of culturing the parasite at temperatures ranging between 16 and 32 °C. The oncomiracidia infection success, time to sexual maturity, and size at sexual maturity of Neobenedenia sp. were examined only at three temperatures (20 °C, 24 °C, and 30 °C). Experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in the laboratory. The oncomiracidia development was found to be faster at warmer temperatures (4-5 days between 24 and 30 °C) than in colder treatments (7-11 days between 18 and 20 °C). Hatching success and oncomiracidia longevity were higher at 24 °C and 26 °C. At 20 °C, 24 °C, and 30 °C, infection success was greater than 90%. Additionally, the laid eggs were observed at 9, 12, and 15 days at 30 °C, 24 °C, and 30 °C, respectively. The results of this study will allow for improving the temporal schedule of applications of treatments against Neobenedenia sp. by the function of temperatures. In conclusion, it is recommended to treat fish more frequently if the temperature in cultures is higher than 24 °C, because Neobenedenia sp. development is faster. As an alternative, the fish could be moved to deeper and cooler waters.</AbstractText>"}

The groups use competing frailty measures, but the premise is similar: in a validation dataset, model the frailty measure vs. claims variables; in the primary dataset, impute frailty status from claims variables and conduct inference with those imputed values in place of the unobserved frailty measure. Potential use cases include risk prediction, confounding control, and prevalence estimation. In this commentary, we describe validity issues underlying these approaches, focusing mainly on risk prediction. Our main concern is that these approaches do not permit valid estimation of associations between the reference standard frailty measure (i.e., 'frailty') and health outcomes. We argue that Segal's approach is akin to multiple imputation, but with the outcome variable omitted from the imputation model, while Kim's is akin to regression calibration but with many variables improperly treated as surrogates.

The aims of this commentary are to discuss the increased variability in old age which intensifies the risk of baseline inequalities, to elaborate on the need to estimate potential baseline group differences in small samples of older participants in exercise intervention, to discuss alternative procedures for creating equal groups at baseline and to provide specific guidelines for selecting the design of small studies.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Main body' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>Small groups with increased inter-individual differences may lead to reduced power, thus differences that truly exist may not be detected, or false group differences may appear in the outcome following the treatment.

Indeed, unusually slow psychomotor speed, a measure predictive of behavioural performance and health outcomes, is found with obesity and ageing, two conditions also associated with chronic inflammation. Yet whether inflammation is the mediating factor remains unclear. Here, we assessed inflammation by indexing interleukin-6 level in blood and measured psychomotor speed as well as indices of selective visual attention in young (mean = 26 years) or old (mean = 71 years) adults (N = 83) who were either lean or currently significantly overweight (mean body mass index = 22.4 and 33.8, respectively). Inflammation was positively and significantly correlated with psychomotor speed, age, and body mass index but not with attention measures. Using mediation analyses we show for the first time that inflammation fully accounts for the significant psychomotor slowing found in those with high BMI. Moreover, we further show that age-related psychomotor slowing is partially mediated by inflammation. These findings support the proposal that reducing inflammation may mitigate weight- and age-related cognitive decline and thereby improve performance on daily tasks and health outcomes more generally.</AbstractText>"}

It evolved largely through the exaptation of pre-existing smaller submodules, each of which are comprised of ancient sets of proteins that are conserved in modern animals and other eukaryotes. Although these ancient submodules themselves have non-neural roles, it has been hypothesized that they may mediate environmental sensing behaviors in aneural animals, such as sponges. Here we identify orthologues in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica of genes encoding synaptic submodules in neural animals, and analyse their cell-type specific and developmental expression to determine their potential to be co-regulated. We find that genes comprising certain synaptic submodules, including those involved in vesicle trafficking, calcium-regulation and scaffolding of postsynaptic receptor clusters, are co-expressed in adult choanocytes and during metamorphosis. Although these submodules may contribute to sensory roles in this cell type and this life cycle stage, total synaptic gene co-expression profiles do not support the existence of a functional synapse in A. queenslandica. The lack of evidence for the co-regulation of genes necessary for pre- and post-synaptic functioning in A. queenslandica suggests that sponges, and perhaps the last common ancestor of sponges and other extant animals, had the ability to promulgate sensory inputs without complete synapse-like functionalities. The differential co-expression of multiple synaptic submodule genes in sponge choanocytes, which have sensory and feeding roles, however, is consistent with the metazoan ancestor minimally being able to undergo exo- and endocytosis in a controlled and localized manner.</AbstractText>"}

Quantitative proteomics identified sequences of hyperphosphorylated and three-repeat tau in transgenic mice, along with signs of RNA missplicing, ribosomal dysregulation and disturbed energy metabolism.

Herein, the longevity effect of KRG was investigated in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> by feeding KRG extracts, and the molecular mechanism of lifespan extension was elucidated by using longevity-related mutant flies. KRG extended the lifespan of <i>Drosophila</i> when administrated at 10 and 25 μg/mL, and the longevity benefit of KRG was not due to reduced feeding, reproduction, and/or climbing ability in fruit flies, indicating that the longevity benefit of KRG is a direct effect of KRG, not of a secondary artifact. Diet supplementation with KRG increased the lifespan of flies on a full-fed diet but not of those on a restricted diet, and the longevity effect of KRG was diminished by the mutation of <i>dSir2</i>, a deacetylase known to mediate the benefits of dietary restriction. Similarly, the longevity effect of KRG was mediated by the reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling.

Oxidative stress in cells arises from both external agents and endogenous processes that generate reactive species, either purposely (<i>e.g.</i> during pathogen killing or enzymatic reactions) or accidentally (<i>e.g.</i> exposure to radiation, pollutants, drugs, or chemicals). As proteins are highly abundant and react rapidly with many oxidants, they are highly susceptible to, and major targets of, oxidative damage. This can result in changes to protein structure, function, and turnover and to loss or (occasional) gain of activity. Accumulation of oxidatively-modified proteins, due to either increased generation or decreased removal, has been associated with both aging and multiple diseases. Different oxidants generate a broad, and sometimes characteristic, spectrum of post-translational modifications. The kinetics (rates) of damage formation also vary dramatically. There is a pressing need for reliable and robust methods that can detect, identify, and quantify the products formed on amino acids, peptides, and proteins, especially in complex systems. This review summarizes several advances in our understanding of this complex chemistry and highlights methods that are available to detect oxidative modifications-at the amino acid, peptide, or protein level-and their nature, quantity, and position within a peptide sequence. Although considerable progress has been made in the development and application of new techniques, it is clear that further development is required to fully assess the relative importance of protein oxidation and to determine whether an oxidation is a cause, or merely a consequence, of injurious processes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Hawkins and Davies.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim was to develop a rational therapeutic approach to SjS patients useful for healthcare professionals, physicians undergoing specialist training, medical students, the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory organisations following the 2014 EULAR standardised operating procedures. The Task Force (TF) included specialists in rheumatology, internal medicine, oral health, ophthalmology, gynaecology, dermatology and epidemiology, statisticians, general practitioners, nurses and patient representatives from 30 countries of the 5 continents. Evidence was collected from studies including primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002/2016 criteria; when no evidence was available, evidence from studies including associated SjS or patients fulfilling previous sets of criteria was considered and extrapolated. The TF endorsed the presentation of general principles for the management of patients with SjS as three overarching, general consensus-based recommendations and 12 specific recommendations that form a logical sequence, starting with the management of the central triplet of symptoms (dryness, fatigue and pain) followed by the management of systemic disease. The recommendations address the use of topical oral (saliva substitutes) and ocular (artificial tear drops, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical corticosteroids, topical CyA, serum tear drops) therapies, oral muscarinic agonists (pilocarpine, cevimeline), hydroxychloroquine, oral glucocorticoids, synthetic immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide and mycophenolate), and biological therapies (rituximab, abatacept and belimumab). For each recommendation, levels of evidence (mostly modest) and TF agreement (mostly very high) are provided. The 2019 EULAR recommendations are based on the evidence collected in the last 16 years in the management of primary 2002 SjS patients and on discussions between a large and broadly international TF. The recommendations synthesise current thinking on SjS treatment in a set of overarching principles and recommendations. We hope that the current recommendations will be broadly applied in clinical practice and/or serve as a template for national societies to develop local recommendations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

This difference is determined by their diet through development. Whereas workers live for weeks (normally 2-6 weeks), queens can live for years. Unfertilised eggs also develop through the same stages but result in a short-lived male caste (drones). Workers and drones are fed pollen throughout their late larval and adult life stages, while queens are fed exclusively on royal jelly and do not eat pollen. Pollen has a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) while royal jelly has a negligible amount of PUFA. To investigate the role of dietary PUFA lipids and their oxidation in the longevity difference of honey bees, membrane fatty acid composition of the three castes was characterised at six different life-history stages (larva, pupa, emergent and different adult stages) through mass spectrometry. All castes were found to share a similar membrane phospholipid composition during early larval development. However, at pupation, drones and workers increased their level of PUFA, whilst queens increased their level of monounsaturated fatty acids. After emergence, worker bees further increased their level of PUFA by 5-fold across most phospholipid classes. In contrast, the membrane phospholipids of adult queens remained highly monounsaturated throughout their adult life. We postulate that this diet-induced increase in membrane PUFA results in more oxidative damage and is potentially responsible for the much shorter lifespan of worker bees compared with long-lived queens.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

Studies show that elasmobranch and teleost fishes generate water currents as a 'hydrodynamic tongue' that presumably transports food towards and into the esophagus. However, it remains largely unknown how specific musculoskeletal motions during transport correspond to food motion. Previous studies of white-spotted bamboo sharks (<i>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</i>) hypothesized that motions of the hyoid, branchial arches and pectoral girdle, generate caudal motion of the food through the long oropharynx of modern sharks. To test these hypotheses, we measured food and cartilage motion with XROMM during intra-oropharyngeal transport and swallowing (<i>N</i>=3 individuals, 2-3 trials per individual). After entering the mouth, food does not move smoothly toward the esophagus, but rather moves in distinct steps with relatively little retrograde motion. Caudal food motion coincides with hyoid elevation and a closed mouth, supporting earlier studies showing that hyoid motion contributes to intra-oropharyngeal food transport by creating caudally directed water currents. Little correspondence between pectoral girdle and food motion was found, indicating minimal contribution of pectoral girdle motion. Transport speed was fast as food entered the mouth, slower and step-wise through the pharyngeal region and then fast again as it entered the esophagus. The food's static periods in the step-wise motion and its high velocity during swallowing could not be explained by hyoid or girdle motion, suggesting these sharks may also use the branchial arches for intra-oropharyngeal transport and swallowing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

However, often a medical concept (e.g. diagnosis, prescription, symptom) is described in various synonyms across different EHR systems, hindering data integration for signal enhancement and complicating dimensionality reduction for knowledge discovery. Despite existing ontologies and hierarchies, tremendous human effort is needed for curation and maintenance - a process that is both unscalable and susceptible to subjective biases.

To this end, we simultaneously assessed how metal pollution and proximity to roads affect body condition and telomere shortening between days 8 and 15 of age in nestling great tits (Parus major), a common urban bird. We employed a repeated-measures sampling design to compare telomere shortening and body condition between nestlings from four urban study sites south of Antwerp, Belgium, which are located at different distances from a metal pollution point source. In addition, we explored associations between metal exposure and telomere dynamics on the individual level by measuring blood concentrations of five metals/metalloids, of which lead, copper and zinc were present at concentrations above the limit of detection. To assess whether roadway-associated stressors (e.g. noise and air pollution) might affect nestling condition and telomere shortening, we measured the proximity of nest boxes to roads. Metal exposure was not associated with nestling telomere length or body condition, despite elevated blood lead concentrations close to the metal pollution source (mean ± SE = 0.270 ± 0.095 μg/g wet weight at the most polluted study site), suggesting that nestlings may have some capacity to detoxify metals. However, nestlings from nest boxes near roads exhibited more telomere shortening between days 8 and 15 of age, and shorter telomeres at day 15. Nestlings in poorer condition also had shorter telomeres, but proximity to the road was unrelated to body condition. Thus, nutritional stress is unlikely to mediate the relationship between proximity to roads and telomere length. Rather, proximity to roads could have affected telomere shortening by exposing nestlings to air or noise pollution. Our study highlights that traffic-related pollution, which is implicated in human health problems, might also affect urban wildlife.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Former professional American-style football players are hesitant to seek help for mental health problems, but may be more willing to report cognitive symptoms. We sought to assess the association between cognitive symptoms and diagnosed mental health problems and quality of life among a cohort of former professional players. In a cross-sectional design, we assessed self-reported cognitive function using items from the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) Item Bank. We then compared mental health diagnoses and quality of life, assessed by items from the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS<sup>®</sup>), between former professional players reporting daily problems in cognitive function and former players not reporting daily cognitive problems. Of the 3758 former professional players included in the analysis, 40.0% reported daily problems due to cognitive dysfunction. Former players who reported daily cognitive problems were more likely to also report depression (18.0% vs. 3.3%, odds ratio [OR] = 6.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] [4.90-8.40]) and anxiety (19.1% vs. 4.3%, OR = 5.29, 95% CI [4.14-6.75]) than those without daily cognitive problems. Further, former players reporting daily cognitive problems were more likely to report memory loss and attention deficit(/hyperactivity) disorder and poorer general mental health, lower quality of life, less satisfaction with social activities and relationships, and more emotional problems. These findings highlight the potential of an assessment of cognitive symptoms for identifying former players with mental health, social, and emotional problems.</AbstractText>"}

Using data from the 2011 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we investigated the validity of a continuum of healthy aging definitions. We found that definitions of healthy aging that emphasize disease of 'significance' and functional health offer a valid and practical approach to the assessment of healthy aging. Results of multilevel logistic regression analyses indicate that socio-structural characteristics of individuals (age, gender, education, and pension status), their households (structure and wealth), and communities (infrastructure and geographic region) are significantly associated with the odds of healthy aging. Policy-level interventions are needed to enable individuals, regardless of their gender, socioeconomic status, and place of residence to experience a healthy old age.</AbstractText>"}

This biological feature could be caused by the chemical differences in phenolic composition. Mango seed was especially rich in monogalloyl compounds, tetra- and penta-galloylglucose, ellagic acid, mangiferin, and benzophenones such as maclurin derivatives and iriflophenone glucoside. Mangiferin showed an inhibitory effect of 31%, suggesting its key role as one of the main contributors to the antiplatelet activity of mango seed.

Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid-vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and metabolic proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of immunity, infection, cholesterol and drug metabolism, while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG pathways of HIF-1 signalling and glycolysis. The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia. The identification of post-translational deimination of critical immunological and metabolic markers contributes to the current understanding of protein moonlighting functions, via post-translational changes, in the longevity and cancer resistance of naked mole-rats.</AbstractText>"}

The formation of this proteinaceous cytomatrix at the AZ (CAZ) depends on precise homo- and hetero-oligomerizations of distinct CAZ proteins. The CAZ protein CAST1/ERC2 contains four coiled-coil (CC) domains that interact with other CAZ proteins, but also promote self-assembly, which is an essential step for its integration during AZ formation. The self-assembly and synaptic recruitment of the <i>Drosophila</i> protein Bruchpilot (BRP), a partial homolog of CAST1/ERC2, is modulated by the serine-arginine protein kinase (SRPK79D). Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the vertebrate SRPK2 regulates the self-assembly of CAST1/ERC2 in HEK293T, SH-SY5Y and HT-22 cells and the CC1 and CC4 domains are involved in this process. Moreover, the isoform SRPK2 forms a complex with CAST1/ERC2 when co-expressed in HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells. More importantly, SRPK2 is present in brain synaptic fractions and synapses, suggesting that this protein kinase might control the level of self-aggregation of CAST1/ERC2 in synapses, and thereby modulate presynaptic assembly.</AbstractText>"}

Platelets adhesion on amyloid plaques also increases the risk of cerebral microcirculation disorders. Moreover, activated platelets release soluble adhesion molecules that cause migration, adhesion/activation of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which may damage blood brain barrier and destroy brain parenchyma. The present study examined the effects of intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training (IHHT) on elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor of AD. Twenty-one participants (age 51-74 years) were divided into three groups: Healthy Control (<i>n</i> = 7), MCI+Sham (<i>n</i> = 6), and MCI+IHHT (<i>n</i> = 8). IHHT was carried out five times per week for three weeks (total 15 sessions). Each IHHT session consisted of four cycles of 5-min hypoxia (12% F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and 3-min hyperoxia (33% F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Cognitive parameters, Aβ and amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, microRNA 29, and long non-coding RNA in isolated platelets as well as NETs in peripheral blood were investigated. We found an initial decline in cognitive function indices in both MCI+Sham and MCI+IHHT groups and significant correlations between cognitive test scores and the levels of circulating biomarkers of AD. Whereas sham training led to no change in these parameters, IHHT resulted in the improvement in cognitive test scores, along with significant increase in APP ratio and decrease in Aβ expression and NETs formation one day after the end of three-week IHHT. Such effects on Aβ expression and NETs formation remained more pronounced one month after IHHT. In conclusion, our results from this pilot study suggested a potential utility of IHHT as a new non-pharmacological therapy to improve cognitive function in pre-AD patients and slow down the development of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Increased sympathetic drive is a hallmark of HF and is associated with disease progression and higher mortality risk. Several mechanisms contribute to enhanced sympathetic activity in HF, but these pathways are still incompletely understood. Previous work suggests that inflammation and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) increases sympathetic drive. Importantly, chronic inflammation in several brain regions is commonly observed in aged populations, and a growing body of evidence suggests neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in HF. In animal models of HF, central inhibition of RAS and pro-inflammatory cytokines normalizes sympathetic drive and improves cardiac function. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to neuroinflammation and its effect on HF progression remain undetermined. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the field of neuroinflammation and autonomic control in HF. In addition, it focuses on cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation in HF and in particular on brain regions involved in sympathetic control. Finally, we will comment on what is known about neuroinflammation in the context of preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction HF.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The gene-by-environment (GxE) study design can be used to determine whether the genetic instrument affects the outcome through pathways other than via the exposure of interest (horizontal pleiotropy). MR phenome-wide association studies (MR-pheWAS) search for the effects of an exposure, and can be conducted in UK Biobank using the PHESANT package. In this proof-of-principle study, we introduce the novel GxE MR-pheWAS approach, that combines MR-pheWAS with the use of GxE interactions. This method aims to identify the presence of effects of an exposure while simultaneously investigating horizontal pleiotropy. We systematically test for the presence of causal effects of smoking heaviness-stratifying on smoking status (ever versus never)-as an exemplar. If a genetic variant is associated with smoking heaviness (but not smoking initiation), and this variant affects an outcome (at least partially) via tobacco intake, we would expect the effect of the variant on the outcome to differ in ever versus never smokers. We used PHESANT to test for the presence of effects of smoking heaviness, instrumented by genetic variant rs16969968, among never and ever smokers respectively, in UK Biobank. We ranked results by the strength of interaction between ever and never smokers. We replicated previously established effects of smoking heaviness, including detrimental effects on lung function. Novel results included a detrimental effect of heavier smoking on facial aging. We have demonstrated how GxE MR-pheWAS can be used to identify potential effects of an exposure, while simultaneously assessing whether results may be biased by horizontal pleiotropy.</AbstractText>"}

Different stimuli can trigger senescence but excessive production or impaired clearance of these cells can lead to their accumulation during aging with deleterious effects. Despite this potential negative side of cell senescence, its physiological role as a pro-regenerative and morphogenetic force has emerged recently after the identification of programmed cell senescence during embryogenesis and during wound healing and limb regeneration. Here, we explored the conservation of tissue injury-induced senescence in a model of complex regeneration, the zebrafish. Fin amputation in adult fish led to the appearance of senescent cells at the site of damage, and their removal impaired tissue regeneration. Despite many conceptual similarities, this tissue repair response is different from developmental senescence. Our results lend support to the notion that cell senescence is a positive response promoting tissue repair and homeostasis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

On average, LLE had exercised ~5 days/wk for ~7 h/wk over the past 48 ± 2 yr. Each subject had a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy to examine myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa single-muscle fiber size and function (strength, speed, power). MHC I fiber size was similar across all three cohorts (YE = 5,178 ± 157, LLE = 4,983 ± 184, OH = 4,902 ± 159 µm<sup>2</sup>). MHC IIa fiber size decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) 36% with aging (YE = 4,719 ± 164 vs. OH = 3,031 ± 153 µm<sup>2</sup>), with LLE showing a similar 31% reduction (3,253 ± 189 µm<sup>2</sup>).

These data indicate that lifelong exercise did not benefit MHC I or IIa muscle fiber size. However, LLE had contractile function adaptations that enhanced MHC I fiber power and preserved MHC IIa fiber power through different contractile mechanisms (strength vs. speed).

Nearly 50 yr of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise training resulted in enhanced slow-twitch fiber power primarily by increasing force production, whereas fast-twitch fiber power was preserved primarily by increasing contractile speed. These unique muscle fiber power profiles helped offset the effects of fast-twitch fiber atrophy and highlight the benefits of lifelong aerobic exercise for myocellular health.</AbstractText>"}

Yet, there is little understanding of how older adults' preferences for different emotion regulation strategies may buffer or exacerbate effects of daily interpersonal tensions on emotional well-being. The present study examined links between interpersonal tensions and daily emotional well-being and whether those links were exacerbated or buffered by general emotion regulation strategy preferences. Participants were from the Daily Experiences and Well-Being Study, which included 293 older adults (aged 65 + years old) who completed baseline interviews, followed by 5-6 days of ecological momentary assessments, and a leave-behind questionnaire regarding emotion regulation strategies. Interpersonal tensions predicted poorer emotional well-being throughout the day and even more so for oldest-old individuals (aged 80 +) compared to young-old individuals. The effects of tensions on emotional well-being were attenuated among adults who generally preferred reappraisal and exacerbated among people who generally preferred avoidance. Reappraisal was particularly important for buffering the effects of tensions among individuals with poorer self-reported health. The findings regarding active coping were more nuanced and varied by age. The current study advances previous research on emotion regulation and social relations by examining older adults and revealing that links between interpersonal tensions, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional well-being vary on the basis of age and self-rated health. This study highlights the importance of considering how personal characteristics may shape later-life well-being in the context of coping with interpersonal tensions.

Many scientific advances have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD. However, the clinical diagnosis of AD remains difficult, with only post-mortem assays confirming its definitive diagnosis. There is a crucial need for an early and accurate detection of AD related symptoms. To date, current diagnosis techniques are costly or invasive. Finding a peripheral biomarker that could provide a sensitive, reproducible, and accurate detection prior to the onset of the AD clinical symptoms will allow identification of 'at risk' individuals, thereby facilitating early initiation of treatments that may prove more effective. Salivary glands contain stem cells, which are affected by aging, suggesting that tissue samples from these glands may reveal a stem cell biomarker of AD, but also stem cells may be harvested from these glands, with proper timing and isolation technique, for cell-based regenerative medicine. Alternatively, instead of the salivary glands, saliva may represent an attractive source for biomarkers due to minimal discomfort to the patient, non-invasive collection, and the possibility of cost-effective screening large populations, encouraging greater compliance in clinical trials and frequent testing. In addition, salivary glands contain stem cells, which are likely also present in the saliva, making these cells as potentially sensitive cellular biomarker of and a therapeutic agent for AD. The aim of this review is to critically analyze the use of saliva for the identification of circulating biological markers to help the diagnosis of early cognitive impairment associated with AD and to generate insights into the potential application of stem cells derived from salivary glands or saliva as therapeutics (i.e., stem cell transplantation) for the disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we confirm that exposing wild-type mice to an enriched environment (EE) facilitates signaling in the hippocampus that promotes long-term potentiation (LTP). Exposing the hippocampus of mice kept in standard housing to soluble Aβ oligomers impairs LTP, but EE can fully prevent this. Mechanistically, the key molecular features of the EE benefit are an upregulation of miRNA-132 and an inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) signaling. Specifically, soluble Aβ oligomers decreased miR-132 expression and increased HDAC3 levels in cultured primary neurons. Further, we provide evidence that HDAC3 is a direct target of miR-132. Overexpressing miR-132 or injecting an HDAC3 inhibitor into mice in standard housing mimics the benefits of EE in enhancing hippocampal LTP and preventing hippocampal impairment by Aβ oligomers in vivo. We conclude that EE enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity by upregulating miRNA-132 and reducing HDAC3 signaling in a way that counteracts the synaptotoxicity of human Aβ oligomers. Our findings provide a rationale for prolonged exposure to cognitive novelty and/or epigenetic modulation to lessen the progressive effects of Aβ accumulation during human brain aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The specificity, which includes the recognition of post-translational modifications, and capacity for engineering that characterize these antibody fragments can be especially well-focused when the genes encoding only the binding sites of the antibody are expressed intracellularly. Multifunctional constructs use fusions with peptides that can re-target antigen-antibody complexes to enhance both pharmacodynamic activity and intracellular solubility simultaneously. Fusions with proteolytic targeting signals, such as the PEST degron, greatly enhance potency in some cases. Stem cell transplants can be protected from exogenous misfolded proteins by stable transfection with intrabodies. Tandem expression to target two or more misfolding proteins in one treatment may be especially valuable for proteostatic disruptions due to genetic, aging, or toxic triggers. Advances in bioinformatics, screening protocols, and especially gene therapy are showing great promise for intrabody/ nanobody treatments of a full range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and related tau dementias, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body diseases, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, among others.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrated the longevity and amyloid-β toxicity attenuating activity of B. utilis ethanolic extract (BUE) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan of the worms was observed under both the standard laboratory and stress (oxidative and thermal) conditions. Effect of BUE was also observed on the attenuation of age-dependent physiological parameters. Further, gene-specific mutants and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strains were used to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects mediated by BUE supplementation. Our results showed that BUE (50 μg/ml) extended the mean lifespan of C. elegans by 35.99% and increased its survival under stress conditions. The BUE also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 22.47%. A delayed amyloid-β induced paralyses was observed in CL4176 transgenic worms. Interestingly, the BUE supplementation was also able to reduce the α-synuclein aggregation in NL5901 transgenic strain. Gene-specific mutant studies suggested that the BUE-mediated lifespan extension was dependent on daf-16, hsf-1, and skn-1 but not on sir-2.1 gene. Furthermore, transgenic reporter gene expression assay showed that BUE treatment enhanced the expression of stress-protective genes such as sod-3 and gst-4. Present findings suggested that ROS scavenging activity, together with multiple longevity mechanisms, were involved in BUE-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, BUE might have potential to increase the lifespan and to attenuate neuro-related disease progression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the growing number of apps on the topic 'diabetes &amp; pregnancy', a smartphone app offering comprehensive and individualized information to both women (before and during gestation) and their healthcare professionals was still missing. To overcome this lack, the Italian Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group conceived and realized in 2016 a novel mobile app called 'MySweetGestation'. It is designed to be an interactive educational tool for both patients and physicians not expert in the field. Through an interactive way of learning, it provides validated information to the user, focusing on different area of interest: from prevention and risk factors for developing diabetes during pregnancy to treatment and follow-up strategies after gestation. Three years since its publication, MySweetGestation has been downloaded in different western and eastern countries worldwide, suggesting a widespread social impact. Easily accessible personalized information made available via mHealth technology may be of great importance to spread controlled information among the pregnant population.

IVD degeneration (IVDD), which mimics disc ageing but at an accelerated rate, is a common and chronic process that results in severe spinal symptoms, such as lower back pain. It is generally assumed that lower back pain caused by IVDD can also develop secondary conditions, including spinal canal stenosis, spinal segmental instability, osteophyte formation, disc herniation and spinal cord and nerve root compression. Over the past few years, many researchers around the world have widely studied the relevance between oestrogen and IVDD, indicating that oestrogen can effectively alleviate IVDD development by inhibiting the apoptosis of IVD cells. Oestrogen can decrease IVD cell apoptosis in multiple ways, including the inhibition of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, reducing catabolism because of inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, upregulating integrin α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and IVD anabolism, activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, decreasing oxidative damage and promoting autophagy.

Reduced osteogenesis and increased oxidative stress have been implicated in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) derived from OP patients. Melatonin has shown positive effects on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation; however, it was unknown whether melatonin could restore OP-impaired osteogenic potential of BMMSCs and what the underlying mechanisms entailed. The objective of this study is to investigate (1) whether melatonin can restore the impaired osteogenic potential of OP BMMSCs by preserving their antioxidant functions, and if so, (2) whether intravenous administration of melatonin can prevent OP-induced bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Ovariectomies were performed in female rats and BMMSCs were isolated from the osteoporotic rats 3 months later. In vitro treatment with melatonin successfully improved the osteogenic differentiation of OP BMMSCs, as evidenced by increased levels of matrix mineralization and osteoblast-specific genes. In melatonin-treated OP BMMSCs, intracellular oxidative stress was significantly attenuated, while levels of intracellular antioxidant enzymes were noticeably up-regulated - particularly superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1). Silent information regulator type 1 (SIRT1) was involved in the melatonin-mediated recovery of osteogenesis and antioxidant functions. Meanwhile, in vivo injections of melatonin via the tail vein successfully ameliorated the bone micro-architecture in ovariectomized rat femurs. Further experiments confirmed that BMMSCs derived from melatonin-treated OVX rats exerted well-preserved antioxidant properties and osteogenic potential. Our findings demonstrate that the administration of melatonin is a promising strategy for treating patients with postmenopausal OP by preserving the antioxidant properties and osteogenic potential of their BMMSCs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These investigations have provided pivotal insights into regional brainstem atrophy but have not addressed microstructural age differences. However, growing evidence indicates the sensitivity of quantitative MRI to microstructural tissue changes in the brain. These studies have largely focused on the cerebrum, with very few MR investigations addressing age-dependent differences in the brainstem, in spite of its central role in the regulation of vital functions. Several studies indicate early brainstem alterations in a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. The paucity of MR-focused investigations is likely due in part to the challenges imposed by the small structural scale of the brainstem itself as well as of substructures within, requiring accurate high spatial resolution imaging studies. In this work, we applied our recently developed approach to high-resolution myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping, a proxy for myelin content, to investigate myelin differences with normal aging within the brainstem. In this cross-sectional investigation, we studied a large cohort (n = 125) of cognitively unimpaired participants spanning a wide age range (21-94 years) and found a decrease in myelination with age in most brainstem regions studied, with several regions exhibiting a quadratic association between myelin and age. We believe that this study is the first investigation of MWF differences with normative aging in the adult brainstem.

In the present study, a p38 MAPK gene (MpP38) was identified from the clam Meretrix petechialis. The full-length cDNA of MpP38 measures 1,720 bp, consisting of a 134-bp 5'-UTR, a 1,095-bp ORF and a 491-bp 3'-UTR. Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of MpP38 increased after Vibrio challenge, implying that MpP38 is involved in clam immunity. Based on our previous study, a transcription factor activated by p38 MAPK, i.e. microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), participated in clam immunity by regulating the expression of phenoloxidase (PO). Coupled with other related reports, the mechanism underlying the involvement of MpP38 in clam immunity is most likely that pathogen stimuli induce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and thus activate MITF to regulate the expression of the immune-related gene PO. The results obtained in this study support this mechanism. First, we found that the MpP38 phosphorylation level increased in response to Vibrio challenge. Second, as revealed by a yeast two-hybrid assay, there was a direct interaction between MpP38 and MITF. Meanwhile, inhibiting the phosphorylation of MpP38 decreased the phosphorylation level of MpMITF, implying that MpP38 phosphorylation is required for MpMITF activation. Additionally, our results showed that there was a regulatory relationship between MpP38 phosphorylation level and PO expression level. With increased MpP38 phosphorylation level, the PO expression level was also increased after Vibrio challenge; when MpP38 phosphorylation was inhibited, the PO expression level was significantly decreased. This study describes the immune function of p38 MAPK in the clam for the first time and analyses its potential underlying mechanism, which will help to elucidate the immune mechanism in the clam M. petechialis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Backscattered electron scans of the block face provide a stack of high-resolution two-dimensional images, which can be used to visualise and quantify cells and organelles in 3D. High-resolution 3D images of biological tissues from SBF SEM have been exploited considerably to date in the neuroscience field. However, non-brain samples, in particular hard biological tissues, have appeared more challenging to image by SBF SEM due to the difficulties of sectioning and rendering the samples conductive.

Previous studies have indicated that genetic mutations in various components of the niche can affect hematopoiesis and promote hematologic abnormalities, but the impact of abnormal BM endothelial cells (BMECs), a crucial niche component, on hematopoiesis remains incompletely understood. To dissect how genetic alterations in BMECs could affect hematopoiesis, we have employed a novel inducible Tie2-CreERT2 mouse model, with a tdTomato fluorescent reporter, to introduce an oncogenic KRas<sup>G12D</sup> mutation specifically in the adult endothelial cells. Tie2-CreERT2;KRas<sup>G12D</sup> mice had significantly more leukocytes and myeloid cells in the blood with mostly normal BM HSPC populations and developed splenomegaly. Genotyping polymerase chain reaction revealed KRas<sup>G12D</sup> activation in BMECs but not hematopoietic cells, confirming that the phenotype is due to the aberrant BMECs. Competitive transplant assays revealed that BM cells from the KRas<sup>G12D</sup> mice contained significantly fewer functional hematopoietic stem cells, and immunofluorescence imaging showed that the hematopoietic stem cells in the mutant mice were localized farther away from BM vasculature and closer to the endosteal area. RNA sequencing analyses found an inflammatory gene network, especially tumor necrosis factor α, as a possible contributor.

Ten Italian Simmental calves were used for the experiment and were offered 6 L of bulk whole milk/d from an open-bucket starting at day 2 from birth and through 5 weeks. Blood samples were collected at birth and weekly to assess biochemical indicators related to energy metabolism and liver function, minerals, markers of inflammation, and oxidative stress. Body weight (BW), heart girth (HG), and solid feed intake were positively affected by aging. Calves increased solid feed intake consumption after 2 week and reached a BW gain of 28.16 kg at 5 weeks. Most of blood biomarkers were affected by age, mostly concerned the period after birth and day 1, whereas no changes were observed for haptoglobin, urea, β-hydroxybutyrate, Na, and K. The amount of milk fed to calves throughout this study contributes to the maintenance of glucose concentration over time, coupled also with a considerable amount of starter intake. Glucose levels associated to the high ADG (0.89 ± 0.09 kg/d, mean ± SEM) suggest that calves experienced a positive energy balance throughout the entire pre-weaning period. Similar levels of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, together with a gradual increase of albumin, reflect good liver functionality and a stable condition regarding the inflammatory status. These results suggest that blood biomarkers of Simmental calves in the pre-weaning phase vary with growing stages.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

High arsenic groundwater and its resulting local arsenic poisoning have caused a great threat to human life and health. The permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is an underground in-situ remediation technology, which has the advantages of high efficiency, low energy consumption, long aging, low operating and maintenance costs. By studying the arsenic removal effects of different materials, this paper selected natural manganese ore, manganese ore granulation, loaded manganese ore and mixed manganese ore as fillers for PRB. And it conducted a simulated experiment to study the feasibility of actual PRB engineering to repair arsenic-containing groundwater. The experiment proves that the removal rate of arsenic by four manganese ore materials exceeds 90%. After examining the geographical location and hydrogeological conditions of the PRB project, the Dengjiatang area of Chenzhou City, Hunan Province was selected as the construction area. Studies show that after the completion of PRB, the arsenic content of the effluent at each monitoring point is below 10 μg/L. It indicates that all four fillers achieve the purpose of removing arsenic, and can be applied to the project according to actual needs. Finally, the safety evaluation of the PRB project was carried out. And FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O was selected as the base curing material and cement was as the process auxiliary stabilizer to solidify the arsenic-containing waste residue. The arsenic concentration in the leaching solution of the arsenic slag after curing is only 1 μg/L.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we report that overexpressing full-length wild-type human tau (hTau) in mouse hippocampus induces learning and memory deficits with remarkably reduced levels of multiple synapse- and memory-associated proteins. Overexpressing hTau inhibits the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and decreases the phosphorylation level of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), GluA1, and TrkB with reduced BDNF mRNA and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. Simultaneously, overexpressing hTau increased PKAR2α (an inhibitory subunit of PKA) in nuclear fraction and inactivated proteasome activity. With an increased association of PKAR2α with PA28γ (a nuclear proteasome activator), the formation of PA28γ-20S proteasome complex remarkably decreased in the nuclear fraction, followed by a reduced interaction of PKAR2α with 20S proteasome. Both downregulating PKAR2α by shRNA and upregulating proteasome by expressing PA28γ rescued hTau-induced PKA inhibition and CREB dephosphorylation, and upregulating PKA improved hTau-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Together, these data reveal that intracellular tau accumulation induces synapse and memory impairments by inhibiting PKA/CREB/BDNF/TrkB and PKA/GluA1 signaling, and deficit of PA28γ-20S proteasome complex formation contributes to PKAR2α elevation and PKA inhibition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Mitochondrial dynamics, regulated by mitochondrial fission, fusion, and trafficking, ensure restructuring of this complex reticulum in response to nutrient availability, molecular signals, and cellular stress. Aberrant mitochondrial structures have long been observed in aging and age-related diseases indicating that mitochondrial dynamics are compromised as cells age. However, the specific mechanisms by which aging affects mitochondrial dynamics and whether these changes are causally or casually associated with cellular and organismal aging is not clear. Here, we review recent studies that show specifically how mitochondrial fission, fusion, and trafficking are altered with age. We discuss factors that change with age to directly or indirectly influence mitochondrial dynamics while examining causal roles for altered mitochondrial dynamics in healthy aging and underlying functional outputs that might affect longevity. Lastly, we propose that altered mitochondrial dynamics might not just be a passive consequence of aging but might constitute an adaptive mechanism to mitigate age-dependent cellular impairments and might be targeted to increase longevity and promote healthy aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Perivascular astrocyte end-feet take up glucose via glucose transporter 1 to actively regulate glycogen stores, such that high ambient glucose upregulates glycogen and low levels of glucose deplete glycogen stores. A rapid breakdown of glycogen into lactate during increased neuronal activity or low glucose conditions becomes essential for maintaining axon function. However, it fails to benefit axon function during an ischemic episode in white matter (WM). Aging causes a remarkable change in astrocyte architecture characterized by thicker, larger processes oriented parallel to axons, as opposed to vertically-transposing processes. Subsequently, aging axons become more vulnerable to depleted glycogen, although aging axons can use lactate as efficiently as young axons. Lactate equally supports function during aglycemia in corpus callosum (CC), which consists of a mixture of myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Moreover, axon function in CC shows greater resilience to a lack of glucose compared to optic nerve, although both WM tracts show identical recovery after aglycemic injury. Interestingly, emerging evidence implies that a lactate transport system is not exclusive to astrocytes, as oligodendrocytes support the axons they myelinate, suggesting another metabolic coupling pathway in WM. Future studies are expected to unravel the details of oligodendrocyte-axon lactate metabolic coupling to establish that all WM components metabolically cooperate and that lactate may be the universal metabolite to sustain central nervous system function.</AbstractText>"}

Glycogen has gained relevance as a key player in brain function. In this regard, genetically modified animals have allowed researchers to unravel new roles of this polysaccharide in the brain. Remarkably, mice in which glycogen synthase is abolished in the brain, and thus devoid of brain glycogen, are viable, thereby indicating that the polysaccharide in this organ is not a requirement for survival. While there was growing evidence supporting a role of glycogen in learning and memory, these animals have now confirmed that glycogen participates in these two processes.The association of epilepsy with brain glycogen has also attracted attention. Analysis of genetically modified mice indicates that the relation between brain glycogen and epilepsy is complex. While the formation of glycogen aggregates clearly underlies epilepsy, as in Lafora Disease (LD), the absence of glycogen also favors the occurrence of seizures.LD is a rare genetic condition that affects children. It is characterized by epileptic seizures and neurodegeneration, and it develops rapidly until finally causing death. Research into this disease has unveiled new aspects of glycogen metabolism. Animal models of LD accumulate polyglucosan bodies formed by aberrant glycogen aggregates, called Lafora bodies (LBs). The abolition of glycogen synthase (GS) prevents the formation of LBs and the development of LD, thereby indicating that glycogen accumulation underlies this disease and the associated symptoms, and thus establishing a clear relation between the accumulation of glycogen aggregates and the incidence of seizures.Although it was initially accepted that LBs were essentially neuronal, it is now evident that astrocytes also accumulate polyglucosan aggregates in LD. However, the appearance and composition of these deposits differs from that observed in neurons. Of note, the astrocytic aggregates in LD models show remarkable similarities with corpora amylacea (CA), a type of polyglucosan aggregate observed in the brains of aged mice and humans. The abolition of GS in mice also impedes the formation of CA with age and at the same time prevents the formation of a number of protein aggregates associated with aging. Therefore CA may play a role in age-related neurological decline.</AbstractText>"}

Additionally, the transcription of vvnoxa, vvrac1, vvbema and vvcdc24 could be repressed when the intracellular ROS were eliminated by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) chloride and reduced glutathione (GSH) treatments. These results indicated a positive feedback loop involving NADPH oxidase and intracellular ROS, which might be the reason for the oxidative burst during injury stress.</AbstractText>"}

A pathological ultrastructural disease hallmark is the presence of NOTCH3-protein containing deposits called granular osmiophilic material (GOM), in small arteries. How these GOM deposits develop over time and what their role is in disease progression is largely unknown. Here, we studied the progression of GOM deposits in humanized transgenic NOTCH3<sup>Arg182Cys</sup> mice, compared them to GOM deposits in patient material, and determined whether GOM deposits in mice are associated with a functional CADASIL phenotype. We found that GOM deposits are not static, but rather progress in ageing mice, both in terms of size and aspect. We devised a GOM classification system, reflecting size, morphology and electron density. Six-month-old mice showed mostly early stage GOM, whereas older mice and patient vessels showed predominantly advanced stage GOM, but also early stage GOM. Mutant mice did not develop the most severe GOM stage seen in patient material. This absence of end-stage GOM in mice was associated with an overall lack of histological vascular pathology, which may explain why the mice did not reveal functional deficits in cerebral blood flow, cognition and motor function. Taken together, our data indicate that GOM progress over time, and that new GOM deposits are continuously being formed. The GOM staging system we introduce here allows for uniform GOM deposit classification in future mouse and human studies, which may lead to more insight into a potential association between GOM stage and CADASIL disease severity, and the role of GOM in disease progression.</AbstractText>"}

However, the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) treated with the DOACs is unknown. With the adoption of the Villalta scale, we assessed the rate of PTS at the end of the follow-up period in a consecutive series of 309 outpatients with acute proximal DVT who had received at least 3 months of treatment with a DOAC and had been followed-up for up to 3 years. The rate of PTS development was compared with that recorded in a historical cohort of 1036 consecutive patients who had been treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and had received a similar follow-up examination. Logistic regression analysis, including propensity scoring to adjust for differing probabilities of undergoing VKA/DOAC, was used to identify predictors of PTS. PTS developed in 87 patients (28.2%) treated with the DOACs (severe in 12), and in 443 patients (42.8%) treated with VKAs (severe in 61). After adjusting for estimated propensity score, age, gender, concomitant symptoms of pulmonary embolism, duration of anticoagulation and development of residual vein thrombosis, the risk of PTS in the DOAC-treated patients was reduced by 54% in comparison to patients treated with conventional anticoagulation (odds ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.63).

Here, we showed for the first time that a chronic exposure of mice to HHE could be a unique tool for NMR-like metabolic remodeling, resulting in a long-term and substantial decrease in metabolic rate, body temperature, and food consumption, without significant changes in expression of stress-related genes. Unexpectedly, the HHE accelerated skin wound healing, despite the lower energy expenditure. The self-produced HHE could be considered a model of voluntary calorie restriction.

The G1/S genes encode factors required for DNA synthesis and the G2/M genes contribute to mitosis. The Retinoblastoma protein (RB) and DREAM complex (DP, RB-like, E2F4 and MuvB) cooperate to repress all cell cycle genes during G1 and inhibit entry into the cell cycle. DNA damage activates p53 leading to increased levels of p21 and inhibition of cell cycle progression. Whether the G1/S and G2/M genes are differentially repressed by RB and the RB-like proteins p130 and p107 in response to DNA damage is not known. We performed gene expression profiling of primary human fibroblasts upon DNA damage and assessed the effects on G1/S and G2/M genes. Upon p53 activation, p130 and RB cooperated to repress the G1/S genes. In addition, in the absence of RB and p130, p107 contributed to repression of G1/S genes. In contrast, G2/M genes were repressed by p130 and p107 after p53 activation. Furthermore, repression of G2/M genes by p107 and p130 led to reduced entry into mitosis. Our data demonstrates specific roles for RB, p130-DREAM, and p107-DREAM in p53 and p21 mediated repression of cell cycle genes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Pairs of neuronavigated TMS pulses (10-ms interval) were delivered over two frontoparietal nodes of the gf network, based on individual functional magnetic resonance imaging data and in accordance with cognitive models of information processing across the prefrontal and parietal lobe. cc-PAS enhanced accuracy at gf tasks, with parieto-frontal and fronto-parietal stimulation significantly increasing logical and relational reasoning, respectively.

However, health span-'healthy aging'-has paradoxically lagged to parallel this increase. Consequently, aging-associated illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease and aging frailty, are having a growing impact on patients, their families, and entire health-care systems. Typically, such disorders have been treated as isolated disease entities. However, the inextricable links between aging-associated disorders and the aging process itself have become increasingly recognized, leading to formation of the field of geroscience. The geroscience concept is that treating the aging process itself should lead to treatment and prevention of aging-related disorders. However, the aging process is complex, dictated by highly interrelated pleiotropic processes. As such, therapeutics with pleiotropic mechanisms of action (either alone, or as part of combinatorial strategies) will be required for preventing and treating both aging and related disorders. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have multiple mechanisms of action that make these highly promising geroscience therapeutic candidates. These cells have a high safety profile for clinical use, are amenable to allogeneic use since tissue-type matching is not required, and can have sustained activity after transplantation. Herein, we review preclinical and clinical data supporting the utility of allogeneic MSCs as a geroscience therapeutic candidate.</AbstractText>"}

In adults, skeletal progenitors proliferate and differentiate into bone-forming osteoblasts in response to increasing mechanical stimuli, though the effects of aging on this response are not well-understood. Here we show that both adult and aged mice exhibit load-induced periosteal bone formation, though the response is significantly attenuated with age. We also show that the acute response of adult bone to loading involves expansion of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Prrx1<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>-</sup>Prrx1<sup>+</sup> cells in the periosteum. On the endosteal surface, loading enhances proliferation of both these cell populations, though the response is delayed by 2 days relative to the periosteal surface. In contrast to the periosteum and endosteum, the marrow does not exhibit increased proliferation of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Prrx1<sup>+</sup> cells, but only of Sca-1<sup>-</sup>Prrx1<sup>+</sup> cells, underscoring fundamental differences in how the stem cell niche in distinct bone envelopes respond to mechanical stimuli. Notably, the proliferative response to loading is absent in aged bone even though there are similar baseline numbers of Prrx1 + cells in the periosteum and endosteum, suggesting that the proliferative capacity of progenitors is attenuated with age, and proliferation of the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Prrx1<sup>+</sup> population is critical for load-induced periosteal bone formation.

The public health system seeks collaborative synergies with the private health system to achieve better health care results, cut waiting lists and cope with financial pressure. The private health sector currently owns 452 hospitals in Spain (57% of the country's total). This paper analyses the financial statements of hospital companies in the Spanish private healthcare system, using compositional data (CoDa) methodology. It identifies a significant relationship between financial statement structure and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Relevant CSR indicators include a sustainability report according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), accreditation by the Joint Commission International (JCI) and ISO 14001, 50001 and 26000 accreditations. These indicators reduce asset turnover and increase debt quality: the proportion of long-term debt within total liability. From a methodological perspective, the paper proposes the first application CoDa in statistical models to predict financial statements from non-financial variables, and the first use of CoDa in partial-least-squares structural equation models (PLS-SEM).

Labord's chameleon (<i>Furcifer labordi</i>) is the tetrapod with the shortest known life span. To investigate to which extent immunosenescence influences the die-off of these chameleons when they are only about 6 months old, we examined the gastrointestinal-, blood- and ectoparasite burden in <i>F. labordi</i> in Kirindy Forest (western Madagascar) and compared them with sympatric and longer living <i>F.</i> cf. <i>nicosiai</i>. Moreover, we included data from wild <i>F. labordi</i> that were singly housed under ambient conditions with daily food and water supply. Gastrointestinal parasite prevalence of wild <i>F. labordi</i> increased dramatically during the last 3 months of their lives, which include the reproductive period. <i>Furcifer</i> cf. <i>nicosiai</i> was found to have a belated increase in gastrointestinal parasites compared to <i>F. labordi</i>. In <i>F</i>. cf. <i>nicosiai</i> higher prevalence of blood parasites were found, which probably result from the longer exposure to the arthropod intermediate host. Both species showed infestations with ectoparasites, which peaked in the rainy season but disappeared towards the dry season. Male <i>F. labordi</i> showed a significantly higher prevalence of gastrointestinal - and ectoparasites and higher intensities of coccidians and ectoparasites than females.

The current study aimed at assessing the relationship between social support and general self-efficacy with social participation. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 456 (male: 237, female: 219) older adults, aged 60-74 years, who were the member of community centers in Tehran, Iran, in 2016. The multi-stage cluster sampling method was employed to select the participants. Primarily, Tehran was divided into five areas (i e, North, South, East, West, and Center). Then, two community centers were randomly selected from each area. Participants with the ability to perform their daily activities independently were enrolled in the study. Participants responded to four self-report questionnaires: socio-demographic, social participation, social support, and general self-efficacy. The majority of the participants were within the age range of 62-68 years with the maximum proportion of social participation (mean ± standard deviation (SD): 37.69 ± 8.34). Findings of the current study indicated that gender, education level, reading books, newspapers, or magazines (p &lt;0.001), living area, living arrangement, and occupational status (p&lt;0.05) were associated with social participation. Multiple linear regression adjusted for living area, sex, and educational level showed that self-efficacy (β= .08; p&lt;.001) and social support (β= .64; p&lt;.001) predicted social participation. Findings showed the importance of social support and self-efficacy in social participation. Also enhancing the literacy of seniors should be given priority.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>©Carol Davila University Press.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We studied the renal and immune phenotypes of miR-146a<sup>+/+</sup> and miR-146a<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 12 months of age, and the results showed that miR-146a<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed autoimmunity during aging, as demonstrated by circulating antibodies targeting double-stranded DNA and an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis associated with a mild renal immune infiltrate. In addition, miR-146a<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed reduced expression of the transmembrane protein Kim1/Tim1, a key regulator of regulatory B cell (Breg) homeostasis, in the kidney and the immune cells. The numbers of memory B cells and plasmablasts were increased in miR-146a<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with the numbers in wild-type mice, whereas Bregs were decreased in number and displayed an altered capacity to produce IL-10. Finally, we showed that miR-146a<sup>-/-</sup> mice develop an autoimmune syndrome with increasing age, and this syndrome includes immune complex glomerulonephritis, which might be due to altered B cell responses associated with Kim1/Tim1 deficiency. This study unravels a link between miR-146a and Kim1 and identifies miR-146a as a significant player in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis pathogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Although research in neuroscience suggests that the values of hedonic and utilitarian goods are similarly represented, it remains largely unknown how these values are mapped during purchasing decisions or task-irrelevant judgments. It has been suggested that people rely more on hedonic (vs. utilitarian) factors when making task-irrelevant judgments, and that this is amplified by trait-reward seeking. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can directly measure the mental processes involved in explicit or task-irrelevant value judgments. Using fMRI, we found that the explicit value of hedonic and utilitarian goods was commonly processed in the ventral striatum. In contrast, no significant results were obtained in common neural processing of task-irrelevant hedonic and utilitarian value. Additionally, we did not find any evidence that trait-reward seeking modulates task-irrelevant hedonic (vs. utilitarian) value processing. Our findings show that the value of both hedonic and utilitarian goods is commonly represented in the ventral striatum, and indicate that the value construct underlying consumer purchases is unidimensional.</AbstractText>"}

Early flowering plants may face advantages of low competition for pollinators and disadvantages of low pollinator abundances and unfavourable weather conditions. However, it is unknown how this trade-off changes over the season and how the timing affects reproductive success. On eight grasslands we recorded intra-seasonal changes in pollinators, co-flowering plants, weather conditions, flower visitation rates, floral longevity and seed set of Pulsatilla vulgaris. Although bee abundances and the number of pollinator-suitable hours were low at the beginning of the season, early flowers of P. vulgaris received higher flower visitation rates and estimated total number of bee visits than later flowers, which was positively related to seed set. Flower visitation rates decreased over time and with increasing number of co-flowering plants, which competed with P. vulgaris for pollinators. Low interspecific competition for pollinators seems to be a major driver for early flowering dates. Thus, non-synchronous temporal shifts of co-flowering plants as they may occur under climate warming can be expected to strongly affect plant-pollinator interactions and the fitness of the involved plants.</AbstractText>"}

However, renal damage often occurs as a side effect because vancomycin is mainly excreted via the kidneys. The mechanism of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is thought to involve the elevation of oxidative stress in the kidneys. Vitamin C (VC) has strong antioxidant properties; therefore, we evaluated the effect of high-dose VC preadministration on vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity. Vancomycin was intraperitoneally injected into mice once daily for 7 d. Additionally, high-dose VC was intraperitoneally injected into mice at 30 min before vancomycin administration for 7 d. The plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were increased by vancomycin treatment; however, high-dose VC preadministration suppressed the increase in these levels. Histological examination also revealed that high-dose VC preadministration reduced the characteristics of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity, such as dilated renal tubules with casts, the dilation of renal proximal tubules, and tubular epithelial desquamation. Furthermore, high-dose VC preadministration reduced the appearance of apoptotic cells presumably derived from the epithelial cells in the dilated proximal tubules. Thus, intraperitoneally injected high-dose VC preadministration reduced vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity in mice. These novel findings may indicate that vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity in humans may be reduced by high-dose VC preadministration.</AbstractText>"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to delay IDD, but the mechanisms by which MSCs attenuate senescence-related degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) remain uncertain. The present study employed a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture system to explore the influence of MSCs on NPC degeneration induced by TNF-α in rat cells. We found that co-culture with bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) reduced senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression, increased cell proliferation, decreased matrix metalloproteinase 9, increased Coll-IIa production, and reduced TGFβ/NF-κB signaling in senescent NPCs. In addition, expression of zinc metallopeptidase STE24 (ZMPSTE24), whose dysfunction is related to premature cell senescence and aging, was decreased in senescent NPCs but restored upon BMSC co-culture. Accordingly, ZMPSTE24 overexpression in NPCs inhibited the pro-senescence effects of TGFβ/NF-κB activation upon TNF-α stimulation, while both CRISPR/Cas9-mediated silencing and pharmacological ZMPSTE24 inhibition prevented those effects. Ex-vivo experiments on NP explants provided supporting evidence for the protective effect of MSCs against NPC senescence and IDD. Although further molecular studies are necessary, our results suggest that MSCs may attenuate or prevent NP fibrosis and restore the viability and functional status of NPCs through upregulation of ZMPSTE24.</AbstractText>"}

Then, interviews and a focus group meeting were conducted with professionals involved in the adaptation process and older clients. The research findings showed that the current number of housing adaptations is relatively small in most local authorities, compared with the potential demand of an aging population. They also revealed some inconsistencies and deficiencies in the system, leading to ineffective and inefficient adaptation service process.

It remains unclear whether this reflects a specific change to episodic memory or a broader alteration to autobiographical narration. To explore age differences across different types of autobiographical narration, we created a lifetime period narrative task that involves describing extended events. For comparison, participants also described unique life events. All autobiographical narratives were scored for episodic, semantic, and other detail generation. Relative to young adults, older adults generated more detailed narratives for remote and recent lifetime periods, which was driven by their increased retrieval of personal and general semantic details. Older adults also generated more semantic details for unique life event narratives, along with reduced episodic detail. More broadly, in both groups lifetime period narratives were largely based on semantic details, whereas episodic details were more prominent in the descriptions of unique life events. These findings indicate that the elevated generation of semantic details associated with normal cognitive aging is reflected in multiple types of autobiographical narration. We suggest that lifetime period narration is a spared aspect of autobiographical memory among older adults.</AbstractText>"}

In recent decades, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) antidepressants have been linked to reduced bone mineral density and increased risk of fragility fracture. However, up to one-third of antidepressant prescriptions are for classes other than SSRIs. Older patients, who are particularly vulnerable to osteoporosis and its clinical and psychosocial consequences, may be prescribed non-SSRI antidepressants preferentially because of increasing awareness of the risks SSRIs pose to bone health. However, to date, the skeletal effects of non-SSRI antidepressants have not been comprehensively reviewed. In this article, we collate and review the available data and discuss the findings. Based on the current literature, we tentatively suggest that tricyclic antidepressants may increase the risk of fracture via mechanisms other than a direct effect on bone mineral density. The risk is apparently confined to current users only and is greatest in the earliest stage of treatment, diminishing thereafter. There is, as yet, insufficient data to conclusively determine the effects of other antidepressant classes on bone. Judicious prescribing of antidepressants among higher risk groups necessitates a thorough review of the individual's risk factors for osteoporosis as well as attention to their falls risk. Further longitudinal, rigorously controlled studies are needed to answer some of the remaining questions on the effects of non-SSRI antidepressants on bone and the mechanisms by which they are exerted.</AbstractText>"}

Exploration of such data in an integrative manner offers excellent possibilities for gaining insights into the molecular effects of food compounds and bioactive molecules at the cellular level. Here we present NutriGenomeDB, a web-based application that hosts manually curated gene sets defined from gene expression signatures, after differential expression analysis of nutrigenomics experiments performed on human cells available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository.

ARHGAP27P1 is a pseudogene-derived lncRNA, and it has been found to be associated with GC in our preliminary study, but this association has not been studied further. Herein, we confirmed that ARHGAP27P1 was significantly downregulated in GC tissues, plasma and cells. Low expression of ARHGAP27P1 was closely associated with advanced TNM stage, increased invasion depth and lymphatic metastasis. Low ARHGAP27P1 expression also predicted a poor prognosis in GC patients. Functionally, overexpression of ARHGAP27P1 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration in GC cells, while silencing of ARHGAP27P1 showed the opposite effects. Mechanistic investigations showed that ARHGAP27P1 had a key role in G0/G1 arrest. We further demonstrated that ARHGAP27P1 was associated with Jumonji-domain containing 3 (JMJD3) and that this association was required for the demethylation of H3K27me3, thereby epigenetically activating expression of p15, p16 and p57. Moreover, knockdown of JMJD3, p15, or p16 consistently reversed the inhibitory effects of ARHGAP27P1 in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Taken together, these results suggest that lncRNA ARHGAP27P1, as a novel cell cycle regulator, may serve as a potential target for GC prevention and treatment in human GC.</AbstractText>"}

However, the poor mobility and aqueous corrosion of NZVI in the porous subsurface have hindered its practical applications. In this research, the NZVI surface was coated with a novel Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> shell (NZVI@Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>) to improve the feasibility of NZVI for remediation. In the column tests for continuous removal of Cr(VI) from the flowing water, the Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> shell greatly improved the delivery of NZVI into the sand columns. Coating NZVI with Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> shell also showed considerably greater chemical stability than bare NZVI and thus greater resistance to aqueous corrosion. In addition, the dissolution of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> allowed the reactivity to be gradually recovered along the sand column for Cr(VI) reduction. As a result, compared to bare NZVI in the columns, NZVI@Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> significantly prolonged the breakthrough period of Cr(VI) and hence increased the columns' Cr(VI) removal capacity. Moreover, the Cr(III) produced was effectively immobilized by NZVI@Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, even under an acidic condition (pH 4.0). The results show that Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> coating is a promising technique to improve the longevity and capacity of NZVI for full-scale in-situ soil and groundwater remediation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study, for the first time, details a methodology to estimate both EC and MRC for Japan, focusing on petrochemicals and woody products utilizing the time series input-output table, physical value tables and the national survey of family income and expenditure, leveraging time series input-output-based material flow analysis (IO-MFA), and structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Findings elucidated hot spots of deleterious consumption by age of householder and the critical factors which underpin them including intensity effects, pattern effects, and demographic shifts over time. Although demographic shifts associated with an aging, shrinking population in Japan decreased EC and MRC, the negative effect reduced in size over time during 1990-2005. Policy implications identify the potential to mitigate approximately 21% of required household emission reductions by 2030 through strategies including recycling initiatives and the recovery of carbon from products covered within current recycling laws and hot spot sectors which are not currently considered such as apparel.</AbstractText>"}

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","Date":"Oct 30 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The gut microbiome (GM) represents a large and very complex ecosystem of different microorganisms. There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their microbiome has not been studied. To determine the role of microbiota on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the microbiota by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut microbiota plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Despite prior work suggesting that distinct neural networks underlie these cognitive operations, there has been little study of these networks in Parkinson's disease, and their relationship to inter-individual differences in impulsivity. High-resolution diffusion MRI data were acquired from 57 individuals with Parkinson's disease (19 females, mean age 62, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.6) prior to surgery for deep brain stimulation. Reward evaluation and response inhibition networks were reconstructed with seed-based probabilistic tractography. Impulsivity was evaluated using two approaches: (i) neuropsychiatric instruments were used to assess latent constructs of impulsivity, including trait impulsiveness and compulsivity, disinhibition, and also impatience; and (ii) participants gambled in an ecologically-valid virtual casino to obtain a behavioural read-out of explorative, risk-taking, impulsive behaviour. Multivariate analyses revealed that different components of impulsivity were associated with distinct variations in structural connectivity, implicating both reward evaluation and response inhibition networks. Larger bet sizes in the virtual casino were associated with greater connectivity of the reward evaluation network, particularly bilateral fibre tracts between the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, weaker connectivity of the response inhibition network was associated with increased exploration of alternative slot machines in the virtual casino, with right-hemispheric tracts between the subthalamic nucleus and the pre-supplementary motor area contributing most strongly. Further, reduced connectivity of the reward evaluation network was associated with more 'double or nothing' gambles, weighted by connections between the subthalamic nucleus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Notably, the variance explained by structural connectivity was higher for behavioural indices of impulsivity, derived from clinician-administered tasks and the gambling paradigm, as compared to questionnaire data. Lastly, a clinically-meaningful distinction could be made amongst participants with a history of impulse control behaviours based on the interaction of their network connectivity with medication dosage and gambling behaviour. In summary, we report structural brain-behaviour covariation in Parkinson's disease with distinct reward evaluation and response inhibition networks that underlie dissociable aspects of impulsivity (cf. choosing and stopping). More broadly, our findings demonstrate the potential of using naturalistic paradigms and neuroimaging techniques in clinical settings to assist in the identification of those susceptible to harmful behaviours.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

Increased life-expectancy coupled with multimorbidity and polypharmacy leads to an increased incidence of MRH, especially in older adults: at a cost of approximately £400 million to the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Harm from medicines has long been recognised by geriatricians, and strategies have been developed to mitigate harm. In general, these have focused on the challenges of polypharmacy and appropriateness of medicines, but impact on the quality of life, clinical and economic outcomes has been variable and often disappointing. The problem of MRH in older adults will continue to grow unless a new approach is adopted. Emerging evidence suggests that we need to take a broader approach as described in our conceptual model, where well-recognised physiological changes are incorporated, as well as other rarely considered psychosocial issues that influences MRH. Parallels may be drawn between this approach and the management of geriatric syndromes. We propose there must be a greater emphasis on MRH, and it, of itself, should be considered as a geriatric syndrome, to bring the spotlight onto the problem and to send a clear signal from geriatric experts that this is an important issue that needs to be addressed using a co-ordinated and tailored approach across health and social care boundaries. This requires a more proactive approach to monitor and review the medicines of older adults in response to their changing need.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

{"PMID":31665145,"Title":"Chronic stability of single-channel neurophysiological correlates of gross and fine reaching movements in the rat.","Journal":"PloS one","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>While substantial task-related neural activity has been observed during motor tasks in rodent primary motor cortex and premotor cortex, the long-term stability of these responses in healthy rats is uncertain, limiting the interpretability of longitudinal changes in the specific patterns of neural activity associated with learning or motor recovery following injury. This study examined the stability of task-related neural activity associated with execution of two distinct reaching tasks in healthy rodents. A novel automated rodent behavioral apparatus was constructed and rats were trained to perform a reaching task combining a 'gross' lever press and a 'fine' pellet retrieval. In each animal, two chronic microelectrode arrays were implanted in motor cortex spanning the caudal forelimb area (rodent primary motor cortex) and the rostral forelimb area (rodent premotor cortex). We recorded multiunit spiking and local field potential activity from 10 days to 7-10 weeks post-implantation to characterize the patterns of neural activity observed during each task component and analyzed the consistency of channel-specific task-related neural activity. Task-related changes in neural activity were observed on the majority of channels. While the task-related changes in multi-unit spiking and local field potential spectral power were consistent over several weeks, spectral power changes were more stable, despite the trade-off of decreased spatial and temporal resolution. These results show that neural activity in rodent primary and premotor cortex is associated with specific phases of reaching movements with stable patterns of task-related activity across time, establishing the relevance of the rodent for future studies designed to examine changes in task-related neural activity during recovery from focal cortical lesions.</AbstractText>"}

We distinguish loci with DNA methylation-dependent (canonical) and independent (non-canonical) imprinting by assaying hybrid embryos with ablated maternally inherited DNA methylation. We find that non-canonical imprints are localized to endogenous retrovirus-K (ERVK) long terminal repeats (LTRs), which act as imprinted promoters specifically in extra-embryonic lineages. Transcribed ERVK LTRs are CpG-rich and located in close proximity to gene promoters, and imprinting status is determined by their epigenetic patterning in the oocyte. Finally, we show that oocyte-derived H3K27me3 associated with non-canonical imprints is not maintained beyond pre-implantation development at these elements and is replaced by secondary imprinted DNA methylation on the maternal allele in post-implantation ExE, while being completely silenced by bi-allelic DNA methylation in the epiblast.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS'>This study reveals distinct epigenetic mechanisms regulating non-canonical imprinted gene expression between embryonic and extra-embryonic development and identifies an integral role for ERVK LTR repetitive elements.</AbstractText>"}

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of immunotherapy in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning immunotherapy in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block, immune checkpoint inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines. The reader will be also provided with hints concerning potential future projection of the most promising immutherapeutic agents and approaches for the disease of interest.</AbstractText>"}

Many neurodegenerative diseases may involve cognitive dysfunction, and we have previously shown that neonatal iron overload induces permanent cognitive deficits in adult rats and exacerbates age-associated memory decline. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway involved in the removal of toxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative events. In the present study, we investigated whether iron accumulation would interfere with autophagy and also sought to determine the effects of rapamycin-induced stimulation of autophagy in attenuating iron-related cognitive deficits. Male Wistar rats received a single daily oral dose of vehicle or iron carbonyl (30 mg/kg) at postnatal days 12-14. In adulthood, they received daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or rapamycin (0.25 mg/kg) for 14 days. Results showed that iron given in the neonatal period impaired inhibitory avoidance memory and induced a decrease in proteins critically involved in the autophagy pathway, Beclin-1 and LC3, in the hippocampus. Rapamycin in the adulthood reversed iron-induced memory deficits, decreased the ratio phospho-mTOR/total mTOR, and recovered LC3 II levels in iron-treated rats. Our results suggest that iron accumulation, as observed in neurodegenerative disorders, hinders autophagy, which might play a role in iron-induced neurotoxicity. Rapamycin, by inducing authophagy, was able to ameliorate iron-induced cognitive impairments. These findings support the use of rapamycin as a potential neuroprotective treatment against the cognitive decline associated to neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>"}

A comparison of individuals moving into new firms shows that participation in general health checks, mammography screening, and prostate-specific antigen tests increases with the share of work peers attending these screenings. To differentiate between peer effects and common influences at the workplace, we further separate the peer groups within firms and show that workers with similar characteristics tend to have a stronger effect on individual screening participation.</AbstractText>"}

However, in vitro-passage aging induces cell cycle arrest and a series of genetic and biological changes, which greatly limits ex vivo cell number expansion and further clinical application of MMSCs. In most cases, DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) act as the main cause and executor of cellular senescence respectively. Mechanistically, DNA damage signals induce cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair via DDR. If the DNA damage is indelible, MMSCs would entry into a permanent cell cycle arrest. It should be noted that apart from DDR signaling, certain proliferation or metabolism pathways are also occupied in DNA damage related cell cycle arrest. New findings of these aspects will also be summarized in this study. In summary, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of DDR associated cell cycle regulation and other major molecular signaling in the senescence of MMSCs.

The research, developed using the qualitative approach of an anthropological nature, is based on the assumptions of ethnography. Individual interviews with a semi-structured script in the universe of 57 elderly people were conducted. The methodology of Signs, Meanings and Actions oriented the data collection and analysis enabling the investigation of representations and concrete behaviors associated with the otherness of the body. There was the sense of production of otherness in relation to two analytical categories associated with aging and disease. A split between the active body of the memory and another experienced with limitations in the present is detected, reflecting the confrontation of self-care and adherence to treatment. The body of the elderly individual is heir to a body image that remodels constantly, depriving the elderly of their place as contemporary owners of their bodies, as they become other persons.</AbstractText>"}

A leading gene presenting heterozygous dominant de novo autism-intellectual disabilities (ID) causing mutations is activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), with intact ADNP protecting against AD-tauopathy. We discovered a genomic autism ADNP mutation (c.2188C&gt;T) in postmortem AD olfactory bulbs and hippocampi. RNA-Seq of olfactory bulbs also identified a novel ADNP hotspot mutation, c.2187_2188insA. Altogether, 665 mutations in 596 genes with 441 mutations in AD patients (389 genes, 38% AD-exclusive mutations) and 104 genes presenting disease-causing mutations (OMIM) were discovered. OMIM AD mutated genes converged on cytoskeletal mechanisms, autism and ID causing mutations (about 40% each). The number and average frequencies of AD-related mutations per subject were higher in AD subjects compared to controls. RNA-seq datamining (hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus-583 subjects) yielded similar results. Overlapping all tested brain areas identified unique and shared mutations, with ADNP singled out as a gene associated with autism/ID/AD and presenting several unique aging/AD mutations. The large fusiform gyrus library (117 subjects) with high sequencing coverage correlated the c.2187_2188insA ADNP mutation frequency to Braak stage (tauopathy) and showed more ADNP mutations in AD specimens. In cell cultures, the ADNP-derived snippet NAP inhibited mutated-ADNP-microtubule (MT) toxicity and enhanced Tau-MT association.

However, few studies have focused on the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cell-mediated humoral immunity or on interactions between CD8+ T cells and B cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that the frequency of IL-21-producing CD8+CXCR5+ T cells was higher in HCC tumor tissue than in peritumoral tissue or peripheral blood from the same patients or in blood from healthy donors. Moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells migrated in response to supernatants from primary HCC (HCC-SN) cells, and HCC-SN cells also powerfully induced CXCR5 expression in CD8+ T cells and IL-21 expression in CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. CD8+CXCR5+ T cells from HCC patients, but not those from healthy individuals, stimulated CD19+ B cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts. These findings reveal that CD8+CXCR5+ T cells strongly infiltrate HCC tumors, and their infiltration is predictive of a better prognosis. Surprisingly, moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells produced IL-21, which induced B cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts and to play a key role in humoral immunity in HCC.</AbstractText>"}

In addition, the aging populations that social work graduates serve are becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. In order to address this issue, it is critical to support students and emerging scholars to not only become more competent in gerontological social work, but also engage in culturally competent research and practices. In this commentary, I described my experiences as a former fellow of the AGESW (Association for Gerontology Education in Social Work) Pre-Dissertation Fellows Program that fosters doctoral students in the field of gerontological social work.

The natural sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene (BCP) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that are mediated by cannabinoid type-2 receptor activation, and these actions promote neuroprotection in different animal models that involve a cognitive damage. Consequently, whether chronic administration of BCP might prevent the age-related cellular and cognitive damage in a model of aging induced by chronic d-galactose (GAL) consumption was assessed here. Male BALB/c mice were administered BCP (10 mg/kg, oral), GAL (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), or GAL+BCP, and long-term memory and cognitive flexibility were evaluated in the normal and the reverse phases of Morris water maze test. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed on prefrontal and hippocampal brain slices to detect glial acidic fibrillary protein and DNA oxidation. Although GAL administration reduced cognitive flexibility (<i>P</i> = .0308), this functional damage was not reversed by administering BCP. However, GAL administration also elevated the total number of astrocytes and their interactions in the hippocampus, and increasing DNA oxidation in the prefrontal cortex. BCP administration impeded the rise in the total number of astrocytes (<i>P</i> = .0286) and the DNA oxidation (<i>P</i> = .0286) in mice that received GAL. Hence, although BCP did not improve cognitive flexibility, it did produce a neuroprotective effect at the molecular and cellular level in the GAL model of aging.</AbstractText>"}

However, little is known about how the major types of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) affect pituitary-ovarian hormonal relationships. This study evaluated these relationships in recently menopausal women (52.45 ± 2.49 yr of age) in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) who were compliant to randomized, double-blinded treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen (o-CEE; <i>n</i> = 109), transdermal 17β-estradiol (t-E2; <i>n</i> = 107), or placebo (<i>n</i> = 146). Androstenedione, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, estrone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured in serum before (baseline) and 48 mo after randomization to treatment. Descriptive summaries of hormone levels were performed, and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the effects of o-CEE, t-E2, and placebo on these hormone levels at 48 mo, adjusting for baseline levels. A network analysis examined the covariance of changes in hormone levels over the 48 mo within treatment groups. As expected, at 48 mo of treatment, hormone levels differed between women in the two active treatment groups compared with placebo, and network analysis indicated stronger relationships among hormone levels in the t-E2 and o-CEE groups compared with placebo. Associations among testosterone, 17β-estradiol, FSH, and LH differed between the o-CEE group compared with t-E2 and placebo groups. Thus, two common HT regimens differentially alter pituitary-ovarian hormone levels, altering feedback cycles and interhormonal associations in recently menopausal women. These interactions provide the basis for future studies investigating the impact of hormonal modulation of aging, including cognitive decline in women.</AbstractText>"}

However, in the 2014-2016 analysis, blacks had higher odds of using DAAs than whites (aOR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.22-1.27). No significant Hispanic-white gap existed during the study period. Income was positively associated with DAA use in both periods. Between 2014 and 2016, patients who received a Part D low-income subsidy had lower odds of using DAAs than patients who did not (aOR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.88-0.92), and patients in areas with the higher income tertiles were more likely to initiate DAAs than those in areas with the lowest income tertile.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>DAA use among Medicare patients remained far below the level needed to eradicate HCV.

Although photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), as a novel noninvasive physiotherapy strategy, has been proposed to improve neuronal survival, decrease neuron loss, ameliorate dendritic atrophy, and provide overall AD improvement, it remains unknown whether and how this neuroprotective process affects Aβ levels. Here, we report that PBMT reduced Aβ production and plaque formation by shifting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing toward the nonamyloidogenic pathway, thereby improving memory and cognitive ability in a mouse model of AD. More importantly, a pivotal protein, SIRT1, was involved in this process by specifically up-regulating ADAM10 and down-regulating BACE1, which is dependent on the cAMP/PKA pathway in APP/PS1 primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing human APP Swedish mutation (APPswe). We further found that the activity of the mitochondrial photoacceptor cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) was responsible for PBMT-induced activation of PKA and SIRT1. Together, our research suggests that PBMT as a viable therapeutic strategy has great potential value in improving cognitive ability and combatting AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

We examined the association between RH and objectively measured stress responses, physical activity (PA), and sleep quality. A diverse group of office workers (n = 134) from four well-functioning federal buildings wore chest-mounted heart rate variability monitors for three consecutive days, while at the same time, RH and temperature (T) were measured in their workplaces. Those who spent the majority of their time at the office in conditions of 30%-60% RH experienced 25% less stress at the office than those who spent the majority of their time in drier conditions. Further, a correlational study of our stress response suggests optimal values for RH may exist within an even narrower range around 45%.

The disease burden of these pathologies emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Skeletal muscle has emerged as a potent regulator of immune system function. As such, skeletal muscle might be the central integrator between sarcopenia and immune senescence in an aging biological system. Therapeutic approaches targeting skeletal muscle might be able to restore both muscle and immune system function. In this review, we therefore outline the current - however still fragmentary - knowledge about the potential communication pathways of muscle and immune system, how they are affected by aging of skeletal muscle and discuss possible treatment strategies.

In view of the significant postnatal maturation of the CNS, juvenile animal studies (JAS) are performed to support pediatric development of these new medicines. In this project, the design and results of juvenile toxicity studies from 15 drug compounds for the treatment of neurologic or psychiatric conditions were analyzed. Studies were conducted mostly in rats; sometimes in addition in dogs and monkeys. The study design of the pivotal JAS was variable, even for compounds with a similar therapeutic indication. Age of the juvenile animals was not consistently related to the starting age of the intended patient population. Of 15 compounds analyzed, 6 JAS detected more severe toxicities and 6 JAS evidenced novel CNS effects compared to their adult counterparts. The effects of CNS on acoustic startle and learning and memory were observed at high dosages. Reversibility was tested in most cases and revealed some small effects that were retained or only uncovered after termination of treatment. The interpretation of the relevance of these findings was often hampered by the lack of matching end points in the adult studies or inappropriate study designs. Detailed clinical observation and motor activity measures were the most powerful end points to detect juvenile CNS effects. The need for more detailed behavioral examinations in JAS, for example, on learning and memory, should, therefore, be decided upon on a case-by-case basis, based on specific concerns in order to avoid overloading the studies.</AbstractText>"}

This cholinergic projection can generate theta oscillations in the hippocampus to efficiently encode novel information. Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) induces acetylcholine synthesis in medial septal nuclei. HCNP is processed from the N-terminal region of a 186 amino acid, 21 kD HCNP precursor protein called HCNP-pp (also known as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)). In this study, we generated HCNP-pp knockout (KO) mice and assessed their cholinergic septo-hippocampal projection, local field potentials in CA1, and behavioral phenotypes. No significant behavioral phenotype was observed in HCNP-pp KO mice. However, theta power in the CA1 of HCNP-pp KO mice was significantly reduced because of fewer cholineacetyltransferase-positive axons in the CA1 stratum oriens. These observations indicated disruption of cholinergic activity in the septo-hippocampal network.

It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and progressive cognitive impairment. To alleviate the symptoms of AD, functional foods and nutrients have been used for centuries. In this study, we investigated whether Cuscutae Japonicae Semen (CJS), a medicinal food traditionally used in East Asia, has effects on memory improvement and synapse protection in AD. We orally administered CJS to 5x familiar AD (5xFAD) transgenic mice and performed the Morris water maze test. The results showed that CJS treatment ameliorated the decline of memory function. Then, we demonstrated that CJS attenuated the degeneration of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampi of 5xFAD mice. To demonstrate the effects of CJS in vitro, we treated Aβ in primary neuronal culture with CJS and observed that CJS rescued the loss of functional synapses. The protective effects of CJS on the synapse were due to the inhibition of activated caspase-3 expression. Additionally, CJS inhibited the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and tau proteins, which contribute to synaptic dysfunction. Taken together, our results suggest that CJS is efficient in alleviating memory loss by rescuing caspase-3-mediated synaptic damage in AD treatment.</AbstractText>"}

The validity of an exponential decay and the origins of deviations are substantiated. The paper shows, that representation of survival data as logarithmic functions visualizes differences better, which allows for differentiating short- and long-term dynamic lifetime. It is more instructive to represent the changing lifetime expectancy for an individual who has survived a certain time, which can be significantly different from the initial expectation just after treatment. Survival data from 15 publications on cancer are compared and re-analysed based on the well-established: (i) exponential decay (ii) piecewise constant hazard (iii) Weibull model and our proposed parametric survival models, (iv) the two-τ and (v) the sliding-τ model.

Current therapies include intensive chemotherapy and ionizing radiation that preferentially kill malignant cells. Unfortunately, they are frequently accompanied by unintended negative impacts, including the induction of cellular senescence and long-term toxicities in normal host tissues. Whether these senescent cells resulting from therapy increase the susceptibility to relapse or secondary cancers is unknown. Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches to eliminate doxorubicin-induced senescent cells in a Notch-driven T-ALL relapse mouse model, we find that these cells inhibit tumor recurrence, suggesting that senescence in response to treatment suppresses tumorigenesis. This finding, together with extensive evidence from others demonstrating that age-associated health problems develop dramatically earlier among childhood cancer survivors compared to age-matched counterparts, suggests a relationship between therapy-induced senescence and tumorigenesis. Although cancer risk is increased through accelerated premature-aging in the long run, therapy-induced senescence appears to protect survivors from recurrence, at least in the short run.</AbstractText>"}

In healthy tissues, the maintenance of MQC depends upon an exquisite balance between mitophagy (removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy) and biogenesis (de novo synthesis of mitochondria). Here, we show that mitophagy is disrupted in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and decoupled from mitochondrial biogenesis during the progression of the disease. Diabetic retinas from human postmortem donors and experimental mice exhibit a net loss of mitochondrial contents during the early stages of the disease process. Using diabetic mitophagy-reporter mice (mitoQC-Ins2Akita) alongside pMitoTimer (a molecular clock to address mitochondrial age dynamics), we demonstrate that mitochondrial loss arose due to an inability of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for diabetes-exacerbated mitophagy. However, as diabetes duration increases, Pink1-dependent mitophagy deteriorates, leading to the build-up of mitochondria primed for degradation in DR. Impairment of mitophagy during prolonged diabetes is linked with the development of retinal senescence, a phenotype that blunted hyperglycemia-induced mitophagy in mitoQC primary Müller cells. Our findings suggest that normalizing mitochondrial turnover may preserve MQC and provide therapeutic options for the management of DR-associated complications.</AbstractText>"}

The high comorbidity between HIV and cocaine use highlights the importance of ascertaining whether there is a compounding effect of cocaine use in individuals with HIV. Among neuropsychological domains impacted by HIV, verbal memory deficits have received substantial attention partly because they have been associated with declines in functional status in HIV positive individuals. We collected California Verbal Learning Test-II data from HIV participants who met lifetime diagnostic criteria of cocaine abuse and/or dependence (HIV/CocDx+, <i>N</i> = 80 &amp; HIV/CocDx-, <i>N</i> = 30, respectively) and those with and without recent cocaine use, which was confirmed by toxicology analysis (HIV/Coc+, <i>N</i> = 56 &amp; HIV/Coc-, <i>N</i> = 57, respectively). The Item Specific Deficit Approach (ISDA) was employed to determine any additional cocaine-associated deficits in encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, which attempts to control for potential confounding factors of memory such as attention. Using conventional methods of evaluating memory profiles, we found that the HIV/Coc + group demonstrated worse learning, immediate and delayed free recall, and recognition in contrast to the HIV/Coc - group; although using the ISDA, we found that encoding was the only significant difference between HIV/Coc + and HIV/Coc-participant, with HIV/Coc - performing better. Our data suggest that for individuals with HIV, cocaine use is associated with a temporary decline in verbal memory, is characterized by greater encoding deficits, and these effects may reduce with abstinence. Clinically, our findings suggest that reduced encoding is the likely contributor to verbal memory decline in HIV/Coc + and these effects are partially reversible-at least to the level of their HIV/Coc - counterparts.</AbstractText>"}

Since the role of cardiac steatosis per se in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 mo before the study. Electron microscopy of the atria of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and five- to ninefold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than in WT mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (&gt;5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than in WT mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-mo-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated disks in WT atria but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with WT atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

White matter tract myelination, a process that continues to unfold throughout adolescence, is reported to be abnormal in several psychiatric disorders. Here, we ask whether psychiatric vulnerability is linked to aberrant developmental myelination trajectories. We assessed a marker of myelin maturation, using magnetisation transfer (MT) imaging, in 10 major white matter tracts. We then investigated its relationship to the expression of a general psychopathology 'p-factor' in a longitudinal analysis of 293 healthy participants between the ages of 14 and 24. We observed significant longitudinal MT increase across the full age spectrum in anterior thalamic radiation, hippocampal cingulum, dorsal cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. MT increase in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus was pronounced in younger participants but levelled off during the transition into young adulthood. Crucially, longitudinal MT increase in dorsal cingulum and uncinate fasciculus decelerated as a function of mean p-factor scores over the study period. This suggests that an increased expression of psychopathology is closely linked to lower rates of myelin maturation in selective brain tracts over time. Impaired myelin growth in limbic association fibres may serve as a neural marker for emerging mental illness during the course of adolescence and early adulthood.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The GSDIII mouse model recapitulate the clinical phenotype in humans, and a nearly full rescue of muscle function was observed in mice treated with the dual AAV vector expressing the GDE transgene.In order to characterize GSDIII muscle morphological spectrum and identify novel disease markers and pathways, we performed a large international multicentric morphological study on 30 muscle biopsies from GSDIII patients. Autophagy flux studies were performed in human muscle biopsies and muscles from GSDIII mice. The human muscle biopsies revealed a typical and constant vacuolar myopathy, characterized by multiple and variably sized vacuoles filled with PAS-positive material. Using electron microscopy, we confirmed the presence of large non-membrane bound sarcoplasmic deposits of normally structured glycogen as well as smaller rounded sac structures lined by a continuous double membrane containing only glycogen, corresponding to autophagosomes. A consistent SQSTM1/p62 decrease and beclin-1 increase in human muscle biopsies suggested an enhanced autophagy. Consistent with this, an increase in the lipidated form of LC3, LC3II was found in patients compared to controls. A decrease in SQSTM1/p62 was also found in the GSDIII mouse model.In conclusion, we characterized the morphological phenotype in GSDIII muscle and demonstrated dysfunctional autophagy in GSDIII human samples.These findings suggest that autophagic modulation combined with gene therapy might be considered as a novel treatment for GSDIII.</AbstractText>"}

Enhancing osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs is a feasible therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. Here, bone marrow stromal cell (ST)-derived exosomes (STExos) are found to remarkably enhance osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. However, intravenous injection of STExos is inefficient in ameliorating osteoporotic phenotypes in an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model, which may be because STExos are predominantly accumulated in the liver and lungs, but not in bone. Hereby, the STExo surface is conjugated with a BMSC-specific aptamer, which delivers STExos into BMSCs within bone marrow. Intravenous injection of the STExo-Aptamer complex enhances bone mass in OVX mice and accelerates bone healing in a femur fracture mouse model. These results demonstrate the efficiency of BMSC-specific aptamer-functionalized STExos in targeting bone to promote bone regeneration, providing a novel promising approach for the treatment of osteoporosis and fracture.</AbstractText>"}

The impact of these mutations on the structure and function of the IRS1 protein was evaluated through molecular modeling studies, and distinct conformational fluctuations were recorded. The variable binding affinities and positional displacement of these mutant models were observed in the ligand-binding cleft of IR. The mutant IRS1 models triggered conformational changes in the L1 domain of IR upon their binding.

To investigate the effects of aging on the gut microbiota independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut microbiome was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut microbiome. Consistent with previous studies on the human gut microbiome, beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut microbiome-age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the microbiome.</AbstractText>"}

Yet, the level of psychosocial functioning is rarely directly asked of young people themselves, despite the widespread recognition that the young person's perspective is valuable and is often at odds with those of other reporters, such as parents or professionals. One possible reason for this is that the field lacks a clear agreed tool to capture this information in a non-burdensome way. To begin to address this gap, this paper describes psychometric analysis of the Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS), a brief and highly accessible self-report measure of young people's psychosocial functioning already used extensively by mental health professionals around the world but with only limited data on psychometric robustness. Using large community (n = 7822) and clinic (n = 2604) samples, we explore the factor structure, construct validity, internal consistency, differential item functioning, and sensitivity of the CORS. We found that the CORS stands up to psychometric scrutiny, having found satisfactory levels of reliability, validity, and sensitivity in this sample. We also found that the CORS is suitable for use with young people as old as 15 years old. That the CORS has been found to be psychometrically robust while being highly feasible (brief, simple, easy to administer) for use in busy clinical settings, combined with the fact that the CORS has already been widely adopted by clinicians and young people, suggests CORS may be an important tool for international use.</AbstractText>"}

Of importance, geriatric skin responds to procarcinogenic ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) in a manner that permits the establishment of tumor cells. Recent studies have indicated that wounding of geriatric skin with fractionated resurfacing lasers and dermabrasion upregulates fibroblast production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and normalizes the procarcinogenic acute UVB response consisting of basal keratinocytes proliferating while still harboring unrepaired DNA damage. The present studies tested the ability of wounding with a commercially available microneedling device to upregulate IGF-1 levels and normalize the geriatric UVB response. Geriatric volunteers were treated with a microneedling device on buttock skin and 3 months later the IGF-1 levels and UVB responses tested in wounded vs control skin. Wounding via microneedling upregulated IGF-1 and resulted in lower levels of basal keratinocytes proliferating with unrepaired DNA damage. The ability of microneedling to protect against the formation of UVB-damaged proliferating keratinocytes indicates the potential of this wounding modality to reduce aging-associated non-melanoma skin cancer.</AbstractText>"}

We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis to determine SNPs associated with the extent of abdominal aortic calcification (n = 9,417) or descending thoracic aortic calcification (n = 8,422). Two genetic loci, HDAC9 and RAP1GAP, were associated with abdominal aortic calcification at a genome-wide level (P &lt; 5.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). No SNPs were associated with thoracic aortic calcification at the genome-wide threshold. Increased expression of HDAC9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells promoted calcification and reduced contractility, while inhibition of HDAC9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells inhibited calcification and enhanced cell contractility. In matrix Gla protein-deficient mice, a model of human vascular calcification, mice lacking HDAC9 had a 40% reduction in aortic calcification and improved survival. This translational genomic study identifies the first genetic risk locus associated with calcification of the abdominal aorta and describes a previously unknown role for HDAC9 in the development of vascular calcification.</AbstractText>"}

We previously reported the reduction of RNA binding protein HuD in pancreatic β-cells of diabetes. Herein, we demonstrate that HuD plays a novel role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial fusion. We show enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation in the pancreas of db/db mice and HuD KO mice. Downregulation of HuD increases the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria and reduces the mitochondrial activity determined by mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in mouse insulinoma βTC6 cells. HuD binds to 3'-untraslated region of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) mRNA and positively regulates its expression. Ectopic expression of Mfn2 in βTC6 cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA against HuD (shHuD) restores HuD-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, our results suggest that HuD regulates mitochondrial dynamics by regulating Mfn2 level and its reduced expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic β-cells.</AbstractText>"}

However, mutations in genes that control chromosome segregation are rare in human tumors as these mutations reduce cell fitness. Screening experiments indicate that the knockdown of multiple classes of genes that are not directly involved in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy induction. The possible contribution of these genes to cancer formation remains yet to be defined. Here we identified gene knockdowns that lead to an increase in aneuploidy in checkpoint-deficient human cancer cells. Computational analysis revealed that the identified genes overlap with recurrent mutations in human cancers. The knockdown of the three strongest selected candidate genes (ORP3, GJB3, and RXFP1) enhances the malignant transformation of human fibroblasts in culture. Furthermore, the knockout of Orp3 results in an aberrant expansion of lymphoid progenitor cells and a high penetrance formation of chromosomal instable, pauci-clonal B-cell lymphoma in aging mice. At pre-tumorous stages, lymphoid cells from the animals exhibit deregulated phospholipid metabolism and an aberrant induction of proliferation regulating pathways associating with increased aneuploidy in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Together, these results support the concept that aneuploidy-inducing gene deficiencies contribute to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis involving the deregulation of various molecular processes such as lipid metabolism, proliferation, and cell survival.</AbstractText>"}

Enhanced SATB2 has been demonstrated to promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in patients with osteonecrosis. Preliminary bioinformatic analysis identified putative binding sites between microRNA-34c (miR-34c) and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) or miR-34c and SATB2 3'UTR. Thus, the current study aimed to clarify the potential functional relevance of MALAT1-containing exosomes from BMSCs in osteoporosis. The extracted exosomes from primary BMSCs were co-cultured with human osteoblasts (hFOB1.19), followed by evaluation of the hFOB1.19 cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralized nodules. The obtained findings indicated that BMSC-Exos promoted the expression of SATB2 in osteoblasts, and SATB2 silencing reduced the ALP activity of osteoblasts and mineralized nodules. MALAT1 acted as a sponge of miR-34c to promote the expression of SATB2. Additionally, BMSCs-derived exosomal MALAT1 promoted osteoblast activity. Moreover, <i>in vivo</i> experiments indicated that miR-34c reversed the effect of MALAT1, and SATB2 reversed the effect of miR-34c in ovariectomized mice.

Tau pathology spreads between neurons and propagates misfolding in a prion-like manner throughout connected neuronal circuits. Tauopathy is accompanied by significant neuronal death, but the relationships between initial tau misfolding, propagation across connected neurons and cytotoxicity remain unclear. In particular the immediate functional consequence of tau misfolding for the individual neuron is not well understood. Here, using microfluidic devices to recreate discretely organized neuronal connections, we show that the spread and propagation of misfolded tau between individual murine neurons is rapid and efficient; it occurs within days. The neurons containing and propagating tau pathology display selective axonal transport deficits but remain viable and electrically competent. Therefore, we demonstrate that seed-competent misfolded tau species do not acutely cause cell death, but instead initiate discrete cellular dysfunctions.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Public awareness of progressive neurodegenerations such as dementias associated with aging or repetitive head trauma is rising. Protein misfolding underlies many neurodegenerative diseases including tauopathies, where the misfolded tau protein propagates pathology through connected brain circuits in a prion-like manner. Clinically, these diseases progress over the course of years. Here we show that the underlying protein misfolding propagates rapidly between individual neurons. Presence of misfolded tau is not directly cytotoxic to the neuron; the cells remain viable with limited deficits. This suggests that neurons with tau pathology could be rescued with a therapeutic disease modifier and highlights an under-appreciated time window for such therapeutic intervention.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Nationwide, CVD-related hospitalization rates increased from 1991 to 2014. Differences between hospitalization rates at age 65 and 66 years, representing magnitude of healthcare deferral until Medicare onset, increased by 7.49 per 100 people 1991 to 2006 overall, and were largest among blacks and Native Americans. Rates of CVD hospitalizations were consistently highest in the Midwest/Deep South.

This study aimed to identify temporal changes in access to healthcare and determinants of such changes from the elderly in China, over the period between 2005 and 2014. Two waves (2005 and 2014) of data were extracted from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), measuring changes in perceived accessibility to healthcare when needed by the elderly (≥65 years). The effects of the explanatory variables (need, predisposing and enabling factors) on the changes were divided into two components using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method: (1) the endowment portion as a result of distribution differences of the explanatory variables and (2) the coefficient portion as a result of differential responses of the dependent variable to the explanatory variables. Perceived accessibility to healthcare from the elderly increased from 89.6% in 2005 to 96.7% in 2014. The coefficient portion (82%) contributed more to the change than the endowment portion (63%) after adjustments for a negative interaction effect (-45%) between the two. Lower perceived accessibility was associated with older age, lower income, lower affordability of daily expenses and lower insurance coverage. But the coefficient effects suggested that their impacts on perceived accessibility to healthcare declined over time. By contrast, the impacts of gender and out-of-pocket payment ratio for medical care on perceived accessibility to healthcare increased over time. Perceived accessibility to healthcare from the elderly improved between 2005 and 2014. Gender gaps are closing. But the increased effect of out-of-pocket medical payments on perceived accessibility to healthcare deserves further investigation and policy interventions.</AbstractText>"}

In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of probiotics. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of probiotics on <i>C. elegans</i> age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, immunity, inflammation and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective, <i>C. elegans</i> appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to probiotics supplementation.</AbstractText>"}

The expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1 in brain endothelial cells decreases due to ionizing radiation treatment and aging. SDF-1 protein treatment in the senescent and radiation-damaged cells reduced several senescence phenotypes, such as decreased cell proliferation, upregulated p53 and p21 expression, and increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, through CXCR4-dependent signaling. By inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3), we confirmed that activation of both is important in recovery by SDF-1-related mechanisms. A CXCR4 agonist, ATI2341, protected brain endothelial cells from radiation-induced damage. In irradiation-damaged tissue, ATI2341 treatment inhibited cell death in the villi of the small intestine and decreased SA-β-gal activity in arterial tissue. An ischemic injury experiment revealed no decrease in blood flow by irradiation in ATI2341-administrated mice. ATI2341 treatment specifically affected CXCR4 action in mouse brain vessels and partially restored normal cognitive ability in irradiated mice. These results demonstrate that SDF-1 and ATI2341 may offer potential therapeutic approaches to recover tissues damaged during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, particularly by protecting vascular endothelial cells.</AbstractText>"}

Although next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the diagnosis of these disorders, biochemical tests remain essential and functional confirmation of the critical genetic diagnosis. While enzymological testing of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes remains the gold standard, oxygraphy could offer several advantages. To this end, we compared the diagnostic performance of both techniques in a cohort of 34 genetically defined PMD patient fibroblast cell lines. We observed that oxygraphy slightly outperformed enzymology for sensitivity (79 ± 17% versus 68 ± 15%, mean and 95% CI), and had a better discriminatory power, identifying 58 ± 17% versus 35 ± 17% as 'very likely' for oxygraphy and enzymology, respectively. The techniques did, however, offer synergistic diagnostic prediction, as the sensitivity rose to 88 ± 11% when considered together. Similarly, the techniques offered varying defect specific information, such as the ability of enzymology to identify isolated OXPHOS deficiencies, while oxygraphy pinpointed PDHC mutations and captured POLG mutations that were otherwise missed by enzymology. In summary, oxygraphy provides useful information for the diagnosis of PMD, and should be considered in conjunction with enzymology for the diagnosis of PMD.</AbstractText>"}

Polydopamine (PDA) as a 'bio-glue' was architecturally built between SiO<sub>2</sub> and CFs to obtain a strong adhesion strength and homogenous SiO<sub>2</sub> distribution onto the surface of CFs. The facile modification strategy was designed by self-polymerization of dopamine followed by the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) onto carbon fibers. Surface microstructures and interfacial properties of CFs, before and after modification, were systematically investigated. The tight and homogeneous coverage of SiO<sub>2</sub> layers onto the CF surface, with the assistance of a PDA layer by self-polymerization of dopamine, significantly enhanced fiber surface roughness and wettability, resulting in an obvious improvement of mechanical interlocking and interfacial interactions between CFs and matrix resin. The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of CF/PDA/SiO<sub>2</sub> reinforced composites exhibited 57.28% and 41.84% enhancements compared with those of untreated composites. In addition, impact strength and the hydrothermal aging resistance of the resulting composites showed great improvements after modification. The possible reinforcing mechanisms during the modification process have been discussed.

This ongoing chromosome mis-segregation results in structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities that have been widely described to promote tumor evolution. In addition to being a driver of tumor evolution, recent evidence demonstrates CIN to be the central node of the crosstalk between a tumor and its surrounding microenvironment, as mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway. The role that cGAS-STING signaling exerts on CIN tumors is both complex and paradoxical. On one hand, the cGAS-STING axis promotes the clearance of CIN tumors through recruitment of immune cells, thus suppressing tumor progression. On the other hand, the cGAS-STING pathway has been described to be the major regulator in the promotion of metastasis of CIN tumors. Here, we review this dual role of the cGAS-STING pathway in the context of chromosomal instability and discuss the potential therapeutic implications of cGAS-STING signaling for targeting CIN tumors.</AbstractText>"}

Within each pair of photos, both were identical except for the specific feature being tested in that comparison, where the image was digitally modified to depict the hypothesized feature. A total of 283 older adults (mean age 71 years) completed the survey by selecting the images they preferred. In this Chinese sample, older park users significantly favored all seven hypothesized walkway features, providing empirical support for the existing research and design-based literature on green space for older adults. This study found minor gender differences in visual preferences for walkway features and increasing preference for access to seating with advancing age. By helping to confirm which walkway features are preferred by older adults, these findings can be used to improve the future design and management of urban parks in China, which are an important source of exercise and recreation for nearby elderly residents.</AbstractText>"}

SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice (<i>Sirt1<sup>ciKO</sup></i>) to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after <i>Sirt1</i> deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance.

The accumulation of senescent cells is considered a hallmark of aging and thought to contribute to the aging pathologies. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a myriad of cellular processes and has important roles in embryonic development, physiological tissue homeostasis, and various pathological conditions. TGF-β exerts potent growth inhibitory activities in various cell types, and multiple growth regulatory mechanisms have reportedly been linked to the phenotypes of cellular senescence and stem cell aging in previous studies. In addition, accumulated evidence has indicated a multifaceted association between TGF-β signaling and aging-associated disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, muscle atrophy, and obesity. The findings regarding these diseases suggest that the impairment of TGF-β signaling in certain cell types and the upregulation of TGF-β ligands contribute to cell degeneration, tissue fibrosis, inflammation, decreased regeneration capacity, and metabolic malfunction. While the biological roles of TGF-β depend highly on cell types and cellular contexts, aging-associated changes are an important additional context which warrants further investigation to better understand the involvement in various diseases and develop therapeutic options.

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino acids. The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids. Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino acid carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino acids during normal metabolism. Analyses of non-essential amino acid isotope profiles showed (1) consistent and general taxon-level metabolic differences between the herbivore, human and whale samples, (2) marked differences among individual humans, ruminants and whales (3) evidence for gluconeogenesis in the wildlife samples, and (4) extensive 13C enrichment likely associated with fasting in the humpback whale sample. Future mammalian research related to the metabolism of growth, reproduction, aging and disease may benefit from using this technique. Values obtained for internationally available samples USGS42 and USGS43 (Tibetan and Indian human hair) provide a first characterization of reference materials for δ13CCARBOXYL profiles.</AbstractText>"}

Quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of the hippocampus was performed after 24 months. CREB signaling and CREB-associated pathways were affected at all doses. The lower doses (0.063 and 0.125 Gy) induced the CREB pathway, whereas the exposure to 0.5 Gy deactivated CREB. Similarly, the lowest dose (0.063 Gy) was anti-inflammatory, reducing the number of activated microglia. In contrast, induction of activated microglia and reactive astroglia was found at 0.5 Gy, suggesting increased inflammation and astrogliosis, respectively. The apoptotic markers BAX and cleaved CASP-3 and oxidative stress markers were increased only at the highest dose. Since the activated CREB pathway plays a central role in learning and memory, these data suggest neuroprotection at the lowest dose (0.063 Gy) but neurodegeneration at 0.5 Gy. The response to 0.5 Gy resembles alterations found in healthy aging and thus may represent radiation-induced accelerated aging of the brain.</AbstractText>"}

The dietary components of a healthy diet, such as carotenoids, vitamins A, C, D, E, polyphenols, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids could help maintain TL. In contrast, a high consumption of sugary beverages, processed meat, and proinflammatory diets is associated with telomere shortening. In a majority of studies TL is positively associated with moderate physical activity. The predominant mechanisms through which a healthy diet and moderate physical exercise could mitigate telomere attrition include decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation. We shall not discuss the associations of possible risk or protective factors in terms of causality since the majority of studies are cross-sectional and randomized controlled trials are limited; accordingly, some results are inconclusive. For future research, we suggest evaluating the individual effects of dietary components, dietary patterns and physical activity, considering repeated measurements and exercise intensity, on TL. It is also advisable to include biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation proteins, and to measure telomerase activity.</AbstractText>"}

Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human obesity, apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human obesity. Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in obesity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA <i>per se</i> or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</AbstractText>"}

There have been numerous developments in flexible ureteroscope (fURS) technology but scope fragility, and the associated high maintenance costs, remains a concern. A comprehensive Medline search for related publications from the last 20 years was undertaken to identify common causes of fURS damage and ascertain practices to minimise this. Flexible ureteroscopy can be due to intraoperative causes (loss of the deflection mechanism, damage to the working channel due and fibreoptic bundle injury) and non-operative damage which occur during cleaning, sterilisation and handling of the fURS. The review summarises the available literature to help highlight common mechanisms of scope damage, and outlines evidence-based measures to reduce the risk of damage and maximise durability. Scope fragility remains a problem with significant associated cost implications. In a culture of rising fURS use and reducing re-imbursement for endourologists, prolonging the longevity of the fURS is imperative for maintaining profitability. There are simple and inexpensive practices which can be immediately adopted to maximise fURS use and reduce the need for repairs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>2019 Translational Andrology and Urology.

Disability is related to social factors, among which is poverty, through various pathways. While women's poverty has been pointed up as a challenge for Europe, our study investigates to what extent and in which countries a greater exposure to economic hardship is associated with older women's disability disadvantage. We used the 2014 EU-SILC data in 30 European countries for men and women aged 50-79 years (<i>N</i> = [1179-17,474]). Disability was measured by self-reported activity limitation and economic hardship by difficulties in 'making both ends meet' and 'facing unexpected expenses'. Country-specific nested logistic regressions measured the women's disability disadvantage and its association with economic hardship. We found that activity limitations and economic hardship varied substantially across Europe, being the lowest in Sweden and Norway. We found gender gaps in activity limitations in 23 countries, always to women's disadvantage. After adjusting for age, this disadvantage was significant in 19 countries. In 11 of these countries, women's excess disability is associated with excess economic hardship in women, especially in Iceland, France, Sweden, and Austria. Women's excess disability and social factors such as economic hardship are linked, even in protective countries. These situations of double disadvantage for women deserve attention when designing policies to reduce health inequalities and to promote healthy ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Springer Nature B.V. 2018.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Linked Lives, Divorce and Mental Health in Europe.","Journal":"European journal of population = Revue europeenne de demographie","Date":"Oct 2019","Keywords":"Depression, Divorce, Intergenerational relations, Linked lives, Mental health","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Previous research has shown that parent's union dissolution has negative consequences for individuals' well-being, parent-child relationships and children's outcomes. However, less attention has been devoted to the effects in the opposite direction, i.e. how children's divorce affects parents' well-being. We adopted a cross-country, longitudinal and multigenerational perspective to analyse whether children's marital break-up is associated with changes in parents' depressive symptoms. Using data from 17 countries and 5 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004-2015), fixed effect linear regression models were estimated to account for time-constant social selection processes into divorce/separation. The results show that across European contexts parents' depressive symptoms increased as one of their children divorced. Furthermore, we found that parents living in more traditional societies, such as Southern European ones, experienced higher increases in depression symptoms when a child divorced than those living in Nordic countries. Overall, the findings provide new evidence in support of both the notion of 'linked lives' and a normative perspective of family life course events.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2018.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recently, TMEM132E, which is highly expressed in inner hair cells, was suggested as a novel ARNSHI gene for DFNB99. A missense variant c.1259G&gt;A: p.(Arg420Gln) in TMEM132E was identified that segregated with ARNSHI in a single Chinese family with two affected members. In the present study, a family of Pakistani origin with prelingual profound sensorineural hearing impairment displaying AR mode of inheritance was investigated via exome and Sanger sequencing. Compound heterozygous variants c.382G&gt;T: p.(Ala128Ser) and c.2204C&gt;T: p.(Pro735Leu) in TMEM132E were observed in affected but not in unaffected family members. TMEM132E variants identified in this and the previously reported ARNSHI family are located in the extracellular domain. In conclusion, we present a second ARNSHI family with TMEM132E variants which strengthens the evidence of the involvement of this gene in the etiology of ARNSHI.</AbstractText>"}

Olive oil is the primary fat source in the Mediterranean diet ; however, only a few studies have investigated the effect of olive oil on aging. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether consumption of olive oil significantly influences aging and memory in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8). Methods : SAMP8 and senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice were fed either 7% soy oil or 1% olive oil and 6% soy oil during a six-month study period. Reduction in memory in passive avoidance learning was examined after two months from the initiation of the experiment. Results : The weight of organs including the liver, kidney, spleen, and fat tissue changed significantly and memory performance was reduced in SAMP8 than in SAMR1 mice. There were no significant differences in SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice; however, blood triglyceride level decreased significantly in SAMP8 mice fed on olive oil. Conclusions : These results suggest that consuming olive oil may not have a protective role in aging and memory recall, but beneficial effects may be related to improvement in lipid metabolism. J.

Diastereomeric mixture of calophyllic acid and isocalophyllic acid (ISO) has been shown to stimulate glucose uptake through GLUT4- translocation. In this study, an attempt was made to investigate the effect of ISO on scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. ISO (5, 25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.) was administered for 3 consecutive days. One hour post-treatment on day 3, scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was given before the animals were subjected to Y-maze, open field, novel object recognition (NOR) or Morris water maze (MWM; 5 consecutive days) paradigms. The mice were sacrificed 45 min after MWM test on day 8. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were rapidly isolated on ice for assay of biochemical markers of oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity. Scopolamine reduced the percentage alternation behaviour in the Y-maze and discrimination index in NOR tests with no significant change in escape latency time in MWM task suggestive of deficit in learning and memory. However, the pretreatment of mice with ISO produced a dose-dependent improvement in learning and memory. Moreover, ISO administration attenuated scopolamine-induced increase in malondialdehyde/nitrite generation and acetylcholinesterase activity and deficit in antioxidant enzyme activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile inflammation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and barrier dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</AbstractText>"}

PACAP has trophic functions in tissue development, and it also plays a role in cellular and tissue aging. PACAP takes part in the regulation of chondrogenesis, which prevents insufficient cartilage formation caused by oxidative and mechanical stress. PACAP knockout (KO) mice have been shown to display early aging signs affecting several organs. In the present work, we investigated articular cartilage of knee joints in young and aged wild-type (WT) and PACAP KO mice. A significant increase in the thickness of articular cartilage was detected in aged PACAP gene-deficient mice. Amongst PACAP receptors, dominantly PAC1 receptor was expressed in WT knee joints and a remarkable decrease was found in aged PACAP KO mice. Expression of PKA-regulated transcription factors, Sox5, Sox9 and CREB, decreased both in young and aged gene deficient mice, while Sox6, collagen type II and aggrecan expressions were elevated in young but were reduced in aged PACAP KO animals. Increased expression of hyaluronan (HA) synthases and HA-binding proteins was detected parallel with an elevated presence of HA in aged PACAP KO mice. Expression of bone related collagens (I and X) was augmented in young and aged animals. These results suggest that loss of PACAP signaling results in dysregulation of cartilage matrix composition and may transform articular cartilage in a way that it becomes more prone to degenerate.</AbstractText>"}

Two-footed jumping tests were performed using a Leonardo Mechanography Ground Reaction Force Platform to assess maximum muscle force, power and Esslinger Fitness Index. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between OA and jumping outcomes. Results are presented as β (95% confidence interval). The mean age of participants was 75.2 years (SD 2.6). Males had a significantly higher maximum relative power during lift off (mean 25.7 W/kg vs. 19.9 W/kg) and maximum total force during lift off (mean 21.0 N/kg vs. 19.1 N/kg) than females. In adjusted models, we found significant associations in males between clinical knee OA and maximum relative power [- 6.00 (CI - 9.10, - 2.94)] and Esslinger Fitness Index [- 19.3 (- 29.0, - 9.7)].

We aimed to assess how prolonged frozen storage and freeze-thaw cycles might affect measures of faecal haemoglobin (Hb) and diagnostic performance of FITs. Methods From 2005 through 2010, participants of screening colonoscopy (n = 2042) and clinical colorectal cancer (CRC) cases (n = 184) provided faecal samples in stool containers (60 mL). The samples were stored at -80 °C for up to 11 years and underwent three freeze-thaw cycles. Between each cycle, a defined amount of faeces was extracted using the manufacturer's sampling device of one or two FITs (RIDASCREEN, OC-Sensor). Faecal Hb concentration and diagnostic performance were calculated and compared across freeze-thaw cycles. Results For RIDASCREEN and the OC-Sensor, repeat measurements were available for 504 and 551 study participants, respectively. Hb concentrations correlated strongly (0.77 and 0.85, respectively) and diagnostic performance indicators were similar at the repeat measurements among the same FITs. For RIDASCREEN we found even slightly higher Hb levels, sensitivities and area under the curves (AUCs) after the third than after the first freeze-thaw cycle. For the OC-Sensor the Hb levels, sensitivities and AUCs were slightly lower after prolonged storage and one additional freeze-thaw cycle. Conclusions Measures of Hb and diagnostic performance were fairly stable, even after long-term frozen storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles of raw faecal samples. Faecal samples collected in prospective screening studies and kept frozen at -80 °C before analysis seem useful for timely and efficient retrospective evaluation of FIT performance.</AbstractText>"}

The amount of monoclinic zirconia in different depths was quantified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with different anode tubes (Cr, Co and Cu). XRD was also used to measure the residual stress of the materials at 0 h, 26 h and 140 h aging times. Vickers microhardness and biaxial flexural strength tests were performed. Data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test, both with α = 0.05 for means comparisons. Weibull parameters were calculated and compared based on the overlapping of confidence intervals (CI = 95%). HT Zirconia presented smaller grain sizes and had a higher rate of t-m transformation over time. The microstructure of the conventional zirconia showed an expressive increase of the grain size and consequently greater morphological variation with the LTD. The non-aged samples (control) did not present any residual stress and the aged ones presented compression stress. All zirconia showed a residual stress increase with the increase of LTD time, but the conventional one showed a decrease after 140 h. HT zirconia showed no significant change in flexural strength over LTD time, but the conventional one showed a strength decrease after 140 h (681.78 ± 121.18 MPa). Vickers hardness decreased for all zirconia samples after 26 h. The mechanics of LTD is significantly altered in different zirconia microstructures. Zirconias with smaller grains are more prone to t-m phase transformation, but present lower variation of residual stress, while larger grains zirconias have a lower surface area and therefore a more pronounced increase in stress over LTD time. Stress values close to the maximum compression stress generates ejection of the zirconia grains, producing defects and causing reduction of the compression stress and consequently decrease of flexural strength.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Older adults in particular have been shown to be negatively affected by PM tasks that require a high amount of attentional resources (i.e., nonfocal tasks). This age-related PM deficit has been attributed to reduced target monitoring in this age group older adults. However, this conclusion was based on indirect measures of monitoring, such as costs of the ongoing task. The present study set out to 1) investigate older adults' PM target monitoring by, for the first time, employing a direct measure (i.e., eye tracking), 2) assess differences in monitoring between PM tasks that differ in their focality, and 3) examine whether differences in PM monitoring can indeed explain older adults' reduced PM performance in nonfocal tasks. Results demonstrate that while older, but not younger adults, showed reduced performance in a nonfocal PM task, overt monitoring (eye movements) of these groups did not differ between focality conditions. Further analyses showed that older adults' performance was still reduced on the strategically more demanding task after controlling for overt target monitoring (i.e., including only trials in which the participant monitored). In contrast to indirect measures of cue monitoring, our findings illustrate that older adults' deficits on nonfocal PM tasks cannot (exclusively) be explained by reduced monitoring. Instead, processing that takes place after target monitoring are discussed as possible mechanisms underlying older adults' reduced PM performance in nonfocal tasks.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Engaging in habitual exercise could attenuate these declines in middle age. In the present study, the event-related potential (ERP) activity of 40 middle age adults (21 females) and 42 young adults (24 females) was recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) as participants completed two cognitive tasks that elicit inhibitory processing, one indexing interference control (i.e., the Flanker Task), and the other response inhibition (i.e., the Stop-Signal task). Congruent arrays elicited significantly earlier peaks in P3b activity compared to incongruent arrays in the Flanker task for non-exercisers and young habitual exercisers. For middle age habitual exercisers, this difference was of much smaller magnitude, and non-significant. This finding suggests that the timing of interference control, as indexed by P3b latency, was similar in the congruent and congruent conditions for middle age adults who engaged in regular exercise. On the Stop-Signal task, the P3b activity of habitual exercisers was larger and peaked earlier than that of non-exercisers, indicating that ERP activity signalling response inhibition was enhanced in young and middle age adult regular exercisers. Sex differences were also observed in peak P3b activity on the Flanker task, results which suggest the relationship between regular exercise and interference control differs between men and women.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the metabolism of glucose and insulin. The Hcrt/orexin system may thus be a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

Although normally kept in a quiescent, nondividing state, these cells can proliferate and differentiate to replace naturally dying cells within their tissue and to repair its wounds in response to injury. Due to their proliferative nature and ability to regenerate tissue, adult stem cells have the potential to treat a variety of degenerative diseases as well as aging. In addition, since stem cells are often thought to be the source of malignant tumors, understanding the mechanisms that keep their proliferative abilities in check can pave the way for new cancer therapies. While adult stem cells have had limited practical and clinical applications to date, several clinical trials of stem cell-based therapies are underway. This report details recent research presented at the New York Academy of Sciences on March 14, 2019 on understanding the factors that regulate stem cell activity and differentiation, with the hope of translating these findings into the clinic.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, we report that the ms<sup>2</sup> conversion mediated by CDK5RAP1 in mt-tRNAs is required to sustain glioma-initiating cell (GIC)-related traits. CDK5RAP1 maintained the self-renewal capacity, undifferentiated state, and tumorigenic potential of GICs. This regulation was not related to the translational control of mt-proteins. CDK5RAP1 abrogated the antitumor effect of i<sup>6</sup>A by converting i<sup>6</sup>A to ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A and protected GICs from excessive autophagy triggered by i<sup>6</sup>A. The elevated activity of CDK5RAP1 contributed to the amelioration of the tumor-suppressive effect of i<sup>6</sup>A and promoted GIC maintenance.

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

However, the detailed mechanisms of immunomodulation by CR remain unclear. In this study, we established a mouse model for CR and analyzed the changes of immune cells in these mice. The CR mice fed a calorie-restricted diet for 4 weeks had lower body weight and fat mass compared with control mice. The proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen cells from CR mice were higher than those in of control mice. Additionally, the proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly decreased and the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon of CR mice was significantly decreased compared with those of control mice. To determine the effect of CR on microRNA (miRNA) expression, serum and tissues were collected from mice and the expression level of miRNA was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. As a result, the expressions of miR-16-5p, miR-196b-5p, and miR-218-5p in serum from CR mice were higher than those in control mice. The expression of miR-16-5p increased in the spleen, thymus, colon, and stomach of CR mice compared with expression in control mice. Furthermore, RAW264 cells transfected with a miR-16-5p mimic significantly decreased the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α under LPS stimulation. These results suggested that miR-16-5p might be a critical factor involving the anti-inflammatory effects of calorie-restricted feeding.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we conduct a narrative review of the existing literature (21 studies) to elucidate whether the depression-inflammation link is symptom specific. Overall, there is evidence that an association exists between neurovegetative symptoms of depression and inflammation, independent of cognitive symptoms.

Only JLO lines falling between 36-54° or 126-144° were considered oblique. To quantify the oblique effect, we calculated z-scores for oblique errors (zOblique = #oblique errors/#oblique lines), and similarly, horizontal + vertical line errors (zHV), and a composite measure of oblique relative to HV errors (zOE). Composite z-scores of EF and AIP reflected domains associated with JLO performance.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 240 eyes of 120 healthy subjects, OCT-A was performed by means of a Topcon swept source OCT. sFAZ and dFAZ areas were measured using the IMAGEnet6 software package. Subjects were grouped by age (six groups) and gender. The mean ± sd age of the subjects was 39.2 ± 17.4 years (50% women, 50% men), ranging from 10 to 69 years. The overall mean sFAZ size in women (0.297 ± 0.110 mm<sup>2</sup>) was significantly larger (p = 0.002) than in men (0.254 ± 0.098 mm<sup>2</sup>).

However, when analyzed by age group, these gender differences appeared only in groups younger than 20 years old and older than 50 years old. Men did not show differences among the six age groups. In women, for both sFAZ and dFAZ, the 20-29 year old group had a smaller FAZ size than the 50-59 year old group. In conclusion for both sFAZ and dFAZ, women have larger areas than men, but this occurs only in the young and old age groups. In men, age does not seem to influence the size of the FAZ, but in women, both sFAZ and dFAZ were significantly smaller in younger than in older ages. These results suggest that retinal changes in retinal structure caused by aging may be different in woman than in men, probably reflecting the more hormonal variations known to exist with age in women.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we analyze the humoral immune response in AD to survey whether APP<sup>+1</sup> or UBB<sup>+1</sup> frameshift proteins, produced as a consequence of the 'molecular misreading' alteration in AD occurring in the APP (amyloid precursor protein) and UBB (ubiquitin-B protein) proteins' mRNA, elicit the production of autoantibodies specific of AD. To this end, APP<sup>+1</sup> and UBB<sup>+1</sup> peptides were expressed in bacteria as 6xHisHalo fusion proteins and after purification to homogeneity their seroreactivity was analyzed using 81 individual sera from AD patients and 43 individual sera from healthy individuals by luminescence beads immunoassay. We found that as a result of the molecular misreading, APP<sup>+1</sup> and UBB<sup>+1</sup> frameshift peptides produced a humoral immune response in AD patients, whose autoantibody levels are significantly higher in comparison with healthy controls. Their combination with a previously reported panel of four autoantigens specific of AD (ANTXR1, OR8J1, PYGB, and NUPR1) increased their diagnostic ability assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves up to an area under the curve (AUC) of 73.5%. Collectively, our results demonstrate that APP<sup>+1</sup> and UBB<sup>+1</sup> frameshift proteins, non-previously described as AD-specific autoantigens, elicit the production of autoantibodies which might be useful as blood-based biomarkers to aid in the detection of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

In wild populations of some species, including murid rodents, lifespans are substantially modified by environmental signals that affect an individual's response to such challenges as unfavourable climatic conditions, parasitic load etc. But the real impact of ageing on natural mortality of most species remains obscure. To clarify how age affects the responsiveness of organisms to environmental challenges, we performed longitudinal laboratory observations of wild-derived northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus). We fixed individual longevity and measured metabolic indexes (basal and maximal metabolic rates), ability to maintain body temperature under acute cooling, plasma corticosterone, indexes of acquired and innate immunity in the same individuals of 3-4, 6-7 and 9-10 months old. The maximum estimated lifespan was about 2 years 8 months, which is considerably older than in nature, but less than 30% of individuals passed the one-year milestone. Regardless of the intense mortality, in the first year of life, animals did not demonstrate any age-related deterioration in physiological functions, except leucocyte number. No consistency in any individual physiological index was found. As the individual longevity of red-backed voles varied between years of captivity, we suggest that the welfare and lifespan of wild animals in captivity may be affected by the environmental conditions in the period preceding removal of the animal from the wild.</AbstractText>"}

In advanced age, cerebromicrovascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction impair neurovascular coupling, contributing to age-related cognitive decline. Recently we developed a resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene)-containing fusogenic liposome (FL-RSV)-based molecular delivery system that can effectively target cultured cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells, attenuating age-related oxidative stress. To assess the cerebromicrovascular protective effects of FL-RSV in vivo, aged (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice were treated with FL-RSV for four days. To demonstrate effective cellular uptake of FL-RSV, accumulation of the lipophilic tracer dyes in cells of the neurovascular unit was confirmed using two-photon imaging (through a chronic cranial window). NVC was assessed by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that NVC responses were significantly impaired in aged mice. Treatment with FL-RSV significantly improved NVC responses by increasing NO-mediated vasodilation. These findings are paralleled by the protective effects of FL-RSV on endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aorta. Thus, treatment with FL-RSV rescues endothelial function and NVC responses in aged mice. We propose that resveratrol containing fusogenic liposomes could also be used for combined delivery of various anti-geronic factors, including proteins, small molecules, DNA vectors and mRNAs targeting key pathways involved in microvascular aging and neurovascular dysfunction for the prevention/treatment of age-related cerebromicrovascular pathologies and development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in aging.</AbstractText>"}

Senescent cells can arise through several distinct mechanisms; one such mechanism is dysregulation of alternative splicing. In this study, we characterised the senescent cell phenotype in primary human astrocytes in terms of SA-β-Gal staining and SASP secretion, and then assessed splicing factor expression and candidate gene splicing patterns. Finally, we assessed associations between expression of dysregulated isoforms and premature cognitive decline in 197 samples from the InCHIANTI study of ageing, where expression was present in both blood and brain. We demonstrate here that senescent astrocytes secrete a modified SASP characterised by increased IL8, MMP3, MMP10, and TIMP2 but decreased IL10 levels. We identified significant changes in splicing factor expression for 10/20 splicing factors tested in senescent astrocytes compared with early passage cells, as well as dysregulation of isoform levels for 8/13 brain or senescence genes tested. Finally, associations were identified between peripheral blood GFAPα, TAU3, and CDKN2A (P14<sup>ARF</sup>) isoform levels and mild or severe cognitive decline over a 3-7-year period. Our data are suggestive that some of the features of cognitive decline may arise from dysregulated splicing of important genes in senescent brain support cells, and that defects in alternative splicing or splicing regulator expression deserve exploration as points of therapeutic intervention in the future.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is not known whether the existence of comorbidities, or clinical interventions intended to reduce comorbidities through weight loss or exercise, alters this connection. We measured inflammation, MT, and physical function in 288 overweight/obese older patients with cardiometabolic disease and self-reported mobility limitations who were enrolled in a weight loss and lifestyle intervention study. At baseline, inflammatory cytokines and LBP-1 were positively correlated after adjustment for age, gender, and body mass index. A higher LBP-1 was significantly associated with poorer physical functional after covariate adjustment. Further, even when IL-6 levels were included in the models, 400-m walk time (p = 0.003), short physical performance battery (p = 0.07), and IL-8 (p &lt; 0.001) remained positively associated with LBP-1. Lifestyle interventions improved body mass and some functional measures; however, MT and inflammation were unchanged. MT is reliably related to inflammation, and to poorer physical function in older adults with comorbid conditions.

Thus, vitamin D has assumed an increasingly dominant role as a key determinant of biological mechanisms and specific clinical conditions. Older people frequently present vitamin D deficiency, a status potentially influencing several mechanisms responsible for different age-related diseases. Centenarians symbolize the ideal model for investigating the peculiar traits of longevity, as they have reached an age close to the estimated limit of the human lifespan. Interestingly, despite the profound heterogeneity of centenarians in terms of health status, all these people share the same condition of severe vitamin D deficiency, suggesting that they may have implemented a number of adaptive strategies to cope with the age-related physiological derangement of vitamin D metabolism. The lesson deriving from centenarians' experience suggests that: i) severe vitamin D deficiency does not preclude the possibility of reaching extreme longevity, ii) strategies to prevent hypovitaminosis D may be useful to slow down the processes of 'fragilization' occurring in aged people, iii) beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation need to be confirmed regarding longevity.</AbstractText>"}

It was revealed that the pollen size of S. salsa treated with NaCl was significantly bigger than that in controls. Furthermore, the pollen viability of S. salsa plants treated with NaCl was also significantly higher than that of control after 8 h of the pollens were collected (from 10 to 27 h). The pollen viability of NaCl-treated plants in the field could be maintained for 8 h (from 07:00 to 15:00) in sunny days, which was 1 h longer than that of control plants (from 07:00 to 14:00). Meanwhile, the pollen preservation time of NaCl-treated plants was 16 h at room temperature, which was 8 h longer than that of control plants. Genes related to pollen development, such as SsPRK3, SsPRK4, and SsLRX, exhibited high expression in the flowers of NaCl-treated plants. This indicated that NaCl markedly improved the pollen viability and preservation time via the increased expression of pollen development-related genes, and this benefits the population establishment of halophytes such as S. salsa in saline regions.</AbstractText>"}

We observed that in some individuals the frequency of LOY in blood clearly progressed over time and that in other men, the frequency was constant or showed other types of longitudinal development. The predominant method used for estimating LOY is calculation of the median Log R Ratio of probes located in the male specific part of chromosome Y (mLRRY) from intensity data generated by SNP-arrays, which is difficult to interpret due to its logarithmic and inversed scale. We present here a formula to transform mLRRY-values to percentage of LOY that is a more comprehensible unit. The formula was derived using measurements of LOY from matched samples analysed using SNP-array, whole genome sequencing and a new AMELX/AMELY-based assay for droplet digital PCR.

Treatment of differentiated ARPE-19 or human primary RPE cells with 200 µM ddI for 6-24 days was not cytotoxic but caused up to 60% depletion of mitochondrial DNA, and a similar reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and NDUFA9 protein abundance. Mitochondrial DNA-depleted RPE cells demonstrated enhanced aerobic glycolysis by extracellular flux analysis, increased AMP kinase activation, reduced mTOR activity, and increased resistance to cell death in response to treatment with the oxidant, sodium iodate. We conclude that ddI-mediated mitochondrial DNA depletion promotes a glycolytic shift in differentiated RPE cells and enhances resistance to oxidative damage.

To date, no available methods can be routinely used to detect infectious HuNoVs in foodstuffs. HuNoVs recognize Histo-Blood Group Antigens (HBGAs) through the binding pocket (BP) of capsid protein VP1, which promotes infection in the host cell. In this context, the suitability of human HBGA-binding assays to evaluate the BP integrity of HuNoVs was studied on GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and GII.4 HuNoVs during natural ageing at 20 °C and heat treatments. Our results demonstrate that this approach may reduce the over-estimation of potential infectious HuNoVs resulting from solely using the genome detection, even though some limitations have been identified. The specificity of HBGA-binding to the BP is clearly dependent on the HGBA type (as previously evidenced) and the ionic strength of the media without disturbing such interactions. This study also provides new arguments regarding the ability of VLPs to mimic HuNoV behavior during inactivation treatments. The BP stability of VLPs was at least 4.3 fold lower than that of HuNoVs at 20 °C, whereas capsids of both particles were disrupted at 72 °C. Thus, VLPs are relevant surrogates of HuNoVs for inactivation treatments inducing significant changes in the capsid structure.</AbstractText>"}

We show that age and tau pathology are related to higher hippocampal ReHo. Functional disconnection between the hippocampus and other components of the MTL memory system, particularly an anterior-temporal network specialized for object memory, is also associated with higher hippocampal ReHo and greater tau burden in anterior-temporal regions.

This in turn inhibits glycolysis allosterically and favors glucose rerouting through the pentose phosphate shunt, eventually enhancing production of NADPH-reducing equivalents. In NER/TCR-defective mutants, augmented NADPH is not counterbalanced by increased production of pro-oxidants and thus pentose phosphate potentiation culminates in an over-reduced redox state.

So far, however, the effects of senescent cells on platelets have not been explored. In addition to serving as a barrier to tumor progression, cellular senescence can contribute to remodeling tissue microenvironments through the capacity of senescent cells to synthesize and secrete a plethora of bioactive factors, a feature referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). As senescent cells accumulate in aging tissues, sites of tissue injury, or in response to drugs, SASP factors may contribute to increase platelet activity and, through this mechanism, generate a microenvironment that facilitates cancer progression. Using in vitro models of drug-induced senescence, in which cellular senescence was induced following exposure of mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A and MCF-7) and gastric cancer cells (AGS) to the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib, we show that senescent mammary and gastric cells display unique expression profiles of selected SASP factors, most of them being downregulated at the RNA level in senescent AGS cells. In addition, we observed cell-type specific differences in the levels of secreted factors, including IL-1β, in media conditioned by senescent cells. Interestingly, only media conditioned by senescent MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells were able to enhance platelet aggregation, although all three types of senescent cells were able to attract platelets in vitro. Nevertheless, the effects of factors secreted by senescent cells and platelets on the migration and invasion of non-senescent cells are complex. Overall, platelets have prominent effects on migration, while factors secreted by senescent cells tend to promote invasion. These differential responses likely reflect differences in the specific arrays of secreted senescence-associated factors, specific factors released by platelets upon activation, and the susceptibility of target cells to respond to these agents.</AbstractText>"}

Seventy-nine healthy participants aged 55-85 years were assessed on locomotor (gait speed, stride length) and cognitive (working memory) performances under single- and dual-task (ST, DT) conditions, and habitual physical activity (daily steps). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed immediately after performance. Salivary α-amylase (sAA) was measured prior, immediately and 5 min after performance. Gait and working memory variables, the area under the curve of sAA (AUC) and DT-ST differences (DT effects) were computed. AUC was higher when the ST or DT performance involved a locomotor component and showed a pre-to-post increment after DT only, whereas RPE was higher when performance involved a cognitive component. Daily steps neither predicted sAA, nor RPE. Associations between DT effects on sAA, RPE and performance emerged in high-active participants only. In aging individuals, DT walking elicits an autonomic stress response presumably led by the challenge to share resources relying upon common neural substrates. This autonomic response seems tuned to gait performance and subjective evaluation of effort in those more accustomed to walking.</AbstractText>"}

However, little is known about the association of body composition with the active, hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D plasma levels (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D with body composition including lean and fat body mass as well as bone mineral density (BMD) in middle-aged sedentary adults. A total of 73 (39 women) middle-aged sedentary adults (53.7 ± 5.1 years old) participated in the current study. We measured weight and height, and we used dual energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure lean body mass, fat body mass and BMD. Body mass index (BMI), lean mass index (LMI), and fat mass index (FMI) were calculated. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D was measured using a DiaSorin Liaison® immunochemiluminometric analyzer. The results showed a negative association of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D with BMI, LMI and BMD (β = -0.274, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.075, <i>p</i> = 0.019; β = -0.268, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.072, <i>p</i> = 0.022; and β = -0.325, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.105, <i>p</i> = 0.005, respectively), which persisted after controlling for age and sex. No significant differences in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D across body weight status were observed after controlling for the same covariates.

Creatine is an endogenously produced metabolite, which has the theoretical potential to counteract many of the morphological and metabolic parameters underpinning sarcopenia. This can occur through a range of direct and indirect mechanisms, including temporal and spatial functions that accelerate ATP regeneration during times of high energy demand, direct anabolic and anti-catabolic functions, and enhanced muscle regenerating capacity through positively impacting muscle stem cell availability. Studies conducted in older adults show little benefit of creatine supplementation alone on muscle function or mass. In contrast, creatine supplementation as an adjunct to exercise training seems to augment the muscle adaptive response to the training stimulus, potentially through increasing capacity for higher intensity exercise, and/or by enhancing post-exercise recovery and adaptation. As such, creatine may be an effective dietary strategy to combat age-related muscle atrophy and sarcopenia when used to complement the benefits of exercise training.</AbstractText>"}

The bioactive properties of quercetin include anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic effects. However, the effect of quercetin on skin aging and the direct molecular targets responsible have remained largely unknown. Herein, we investigated the protective effect of quercetin against UV-mediated skin aging and the molecular mechanisms responsible. Treatment with quercetin suppressed UV-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and prevented UV-mediated collagen degradation in human skin tissues. Quercetin exerted potent inhibitory effects towards UV-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity. Further examination of the upstream signaling pathways revealed that quercetin can attenuate UV-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N terminal kinases (JNK), protein kinase B (Akt), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Kinase assays using purified protein demonstrated that quercetin can directly inhibit protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) kinase activity. Quercetin was observed to bind to PKCδ and JAK2 in pull-down assays. These findings suggest that quercetin can directly target PKCδ and JAK2 in the skin to elicit protective effects against UV-mediated skin aging and inflammation. Our results highlight the potential use of quercetin as a natural agent for anti-skin aging applications.</AbstractText>"}

The progressive decline in mobility promoted by aging has been previously attributed to the loss of skeletal mass and function and more recently linked to changes in body fat composition and quantity. Regardless of body size, visceral and intermuscular adipose depots increase with aging and are associated with adverse health outcomes. However, the quality of adipose tissue, in particular abdominal subcutaneous as it is the largest depot, likely plays a significant role in aging outcomes, such as mobility decline, though its communication with other tissues such as skeletal muscle. In this review, we discuss the age-associated development of a pro-inflammatory profile, cellular senescence, and metabolic inflexibility in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Collectively, these facets of adipose tissue quality influence its secretory profile and crosstalk with skeletal muscle and likely contribute to the development of muscle atrophy and disability. Therefore, the identification of the key structural and functional components of adipose tissue quality-including necrosis, senescence, inflammation, self-renewal, metabolic flexibility-and adipose tissue-secreted proteins that influence mobility via direct effects on skeletal muscle are necessary to prevent morbidity/mortality in the aging population.</AbstractText>"}

In most of its service environments, EPC is inevitably exposed to severe weather conditions, e.g., violent changes in temperature, rain, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In this paper, we designed an accelerated aging test for EPC, which includes periodic variation of temperature and water spray, as well as intensive UV-light irradiation, imitating the outdoor environment in South China. The experimental results show that the flexural performance of EPC is found deteriorate with the aging time. An aging process equivalent to four years (UV radiation dose) results in up to 8.4% reduction of flexural strength. To explore the mechanisms of observed performance degradation, the EPC specimen in the four-point-bending test is considered as a layered beam. The analysis indicates that the loss of flexural load-carrying capacity of an aged EPC beam is dominated by the reduction of mechanical properties of the surface layer. The mechanical properties of the surface layer are closely associated with the aging of epoxy mortar, which can be approximated as a reciprocal function of the aging time. By introducing damage to the surface layer into the layered beam, the proposed model demonstrates a good ability to predict the residual flexural strength of EPC during the aging process.</AbstractText>"}

The merit of this fusion is that it provides anatomical information for the accurate detection of pathological areas characterized in functional imaging by physiological abnormalities. First, quantification of brain tissue volumes is proposed based on a fusion scheme in three successive steps: modeling, fusion and decision. (1) Modeling which consists of three sub-steps: the initialization of the centroids of the tissue clusters by applying the Bias corrected Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Then, the optimization of the initial partition is performed by running genetic algorithms. Finally, the creation of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue maps by applying the Possibilistic FCM clustering algorithm. (2) Fusion using a possibilistic operator to merge the maps of the MRI and PET images highlighting redundancies and managing ambiguities. (3) Decision offering more representative anatomo-functional fusion images. Second, a support vector data description (SVDD) classifier is used that must reliably distinguish AD from normal aging and automatically detects outliers. The 'divide and conquer' strategy is then used, which speeds up the SVDD process and reduces the load and cost of the calculating. The robustness of the tissue quantification process is proven against noise (20% level), partial volume effects and when inhomogeneities of spatial intensity are high. Thus, the superiority of the SVDD classifier over competing conventional systems is also demonstrated with the adoption of the 10-fold cross-validation approach for synthetic datasets (Alzheimer disease neuroimaging (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)) and real images.

However, less is known about their role in the healthy adult brain. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are widely accepted to strongly contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and to modulate neuronal function. On the other hand, contribution of microglia to cognition and behavior is only beginning to be understood. The ability to probe their function has become possible using microglial depletion assays and conditional mutants. Studies have shown that the absence of microglia results in cognitive and learning deficits in rodents during development, but this effect is less pronounced in adults. However, evidence suggests that microglia play a role in cognition and learning in adulthood and, at a cellular level, may modulate adult neurogenesis.

Experiments involving the knockdown of DMNT expression led to the discovery that the expression of ACADS in the HCC cells was significantly increased. The TCGA database was then employed to identify tumor tissue samples which showed higher methylation levels at cg01535453, cg08618068, and cg10174836 (which are the target sites of the ACADS CpG islands) as compared with normal liver tissue samples.

This LTL tracking stems from the inability of person-to-person variation in age-dependent LTL shortening during adulthood to offset the wide interindividual LTL variation established prior to adult life. However, LTL tracking in children is unstudied. This study aimed to examine LTL shortening rates and tracking in children and their parents. Longitudinal study in children (<i>n</i> = 67) and their parents (<i>n</i> = 99), whose ages at baseline were 11.4 ± 0.3 and 43.4 ± 0.4 yr, respectively. LTL was measured by Southern blotting at baseline and ∼14 yr thereafter. LTL displayed tracking in both children [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.905, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001] and their parents (ICC = 0.856, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).

Here, we used a two-stage design to measure 275 protein markers by proximity extension assay (PEA), first in plasma samples of a discovery set consisting of 98 newly diagnosed CRC cases and 100 age- and gender-matched controls free of neoplasm at screening colonoscopy. An algorithm predicting the presence of early- or late-stage CRC was derived by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression with .632+ bootstrap method, and the algorithms were then validated using PEA again in an independent validation set consisting of participants of screening colonoscopy with and without CRC (n = 56 and 102, respectively). Three different signatures for all-, early-, and late-stage CRC consisting of 9, 12, and 11 protein markers were obtained in the discovery set with areas under the curves (AUCs) after .632 + bootstrap adjustment of 0.92, 0.91, and 0.96, respectively. External validation among participants of screening colonoscopy yielded AUCs of 0.76 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.67-0.84], 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.87), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.89) for all-, early-, and late-stage CRC, respectively.

While genetic defects have also been associated with disc degeneration, the precise mechanisms driving the initiation and progression of disease have remained elusive due to a paucity of genetic animal models. Here, we discuss a novel conditional mouse genetic model of endplate-oriented disc herniations in adult mice. Using conditional mouse genetics, we show increased mechanical stiffness and reveal dysregulation of typical gene expression profiles of the IVD in adhesion G-protein coupled receptor G6 (Adgrg6) mutant mice prior to the onset of endplate-oriented disc herniations in adult mice. We observed increased STAT3 activation prior to IVD defects and go on to demonstrate that treatment of Adgrg6 conditional mutant mice with a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation ameliorates endplate-oriented herniations. These findings establish ADGRG6 and STAT3 as novel regulators of IVD endplate and growth plate integrity in the mouse, and implicate ADGRG6/STAT3 signaling as promising therapeutic targets for endplate-oriented disc degeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Impairments in reflex cutaneous vasodilation and sweating response can augment the vulnerability of older adults to heat-related injuries following exposure to heat stress. Mechanisms underlying a compromised cutaneous vasodilation are suggested to include reduced sympathetic neural drive, diminished cholinergic co-transmitter contribution, and altered second messenger signaling events. On the other hand, impairments in sweating response are ascribed to reduced sweat gland cholinergic sensitivity and altered cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide signaling. Several practical mitigation strategies such as exercise, passive heating, and behavioral adaptations are proposed as means to overcome heat stress and improve thermal tolerance in the aged. Aerobic exercise training is shown to be amongst the most effective ways to enhance thermoregulatory function. However, in elderly with limited exercise capability due to chronic diseases and mobility issues, passive heating can serve as a functional alternative as it has been shown to confer similar benefits to that of exercise training. Supplementary to exercise training and passive heating, behavioral adaptations can be applied to further enhance the heat-preparedness of the aged.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Here, we collected structural and resting-state functional MRI data at two time points separated by 2-3 years in 75 middle-aged and older adults (age 49-80, SD = 6.91 years) which allowed us to assess the long-term stability of the functional connectome. We show that the connectome backbone generally remains stable over a 2-3 years period in middle and older age. Independent of age, cortical volume was associated with the connectome stability of several canonical resting-state networks, suggesting that the connectome backbone relates to structural properties of the cortex. Moreover, the individual longitudinal stability of subcortical and default mode networks was associated with individual differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of episodic memory performance, providing new evidence for the importance of these networks in maintaining mnemonic processing in middle and old age.

However, only 2 biomarkers have been identified, and the studies were conducted in adult individuals where confounding effects of comorbid diseases cannot be excluded. We therefore tested associations between pain sensitivity and 119 inflammation-related serum biomarkers in 827 healthy adolescents (15-19 years) in the population-based Tromsø Study: Fit Futures. The main outcome measure was cold-pressor pain tolerance (CPT), tested by placing the dominant hand in circulating cold (3°C) water for a maximum of 105 seconds. Secondary outcomes were heat and pressure pain threshold and tolerance. Twelve proteins and 6 fatty acids were significantly associated with CPT after adjustment for possible confounding factors and correction for multiple comparisons. Of these, all fatty acids and 10 proteins were protective, ie, higher biomarkers levels were associated with increased CPT, whereas 2 biomarkers were associated with lower tolerance. Taken together, these biomarkers predicted completion of the tolerance test with a C-statistic of 0.65. Results for heat and pressure pain tolerance were remarkably similar, strengthening the generalizability of our findings. In this cohort of young healthy individuals, we found a relationship between inflammation-related biomarkers and pain tolerance and thresholds. Biomarkers with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects predominated, suggesting that the development of prophylactic dietary or pharmaceutical treatments may be possible.</AbstractText>"}

Transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has been shown to improve neurological function recovery after TBI. However, the survival of BMSCs after transplantation in early-stage TBI is limited, and much is unknown about the mechanisms mediating this neurological function recovery. Secretion of neurotrophic factors, including neurotrophin 3 (NT3), is one of the critical factors mediating BMSC neurological function recovery.

Conservative management is a well-established treatment approach in a number of Western countries, including the United Kingdom (U.K.). In contrast, despite clinical practice guidelines in the United States (U.S.) recommending that nephrologists discuss all treatment options, including conservative management, with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients, studies suggest that this rarely occurs.

Three themes revealed different decision-making strategies that nephrologists use to reduce this emotional burden: 1) convincing patients to 'just do it' (i.e. dialysis), 2) shifting the decision-making responsibility to patients, and 3) utilizing time-limited trials of dialysis.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>A decision not to start dialysis and instead pursue conservative management can be emotionally burdensome for nephrologists for a number of reasons including clinical uncertainty about prognosis on dialysis and discomfort with death.

Significant advancements in biomarkers of chronic stress have been made, with the use of fingernails recently explored. Cross sectional data from the Australian Aboriginal Birth Cohort (Indigenous) and Top End Cohort (non-Indigenous) were used to investigate the associations (sociodemographic and emotional) of fingernail cortisol in Indigenous and non-Indigenous young adults. Details on sociodemographic (age, gender, and Indigenous identification), smoking and alcohol use, emotional wellbeing, and emotional stress (perceived stress and stressful events), and fingernail samples were obtained face-to-face. Fingernail samples were analyzed for 179 Indigenous and 66 non-Indigenous participants (21-28 years).

Median cortisol levels were similar between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants (4.36 pg/mg; IQR 2.2, 10.0 <i>vs.</i> 3.87 pg/mg: IQR 2.0, 9.7; <i>p</i> = .68). However, Indigenous participants had a higher cortisol level on adjustment for emotional distress and exposure to stressful events (Geometric Mean 1.82; 95CI: 1.07-3.09), with a negative association with increasing number of stressful events (Geometric Mean 0.94; 95CI 0.90, 0.99). Collection of fingernails was an easily conducted, well-tolerated method to measure stress markers in this multicultural cohort. Indigenous young adults experienced a high number of stressful events which was associated with a lowering of fingernail cortisol levels.Lay abstractChronic stress can impact negatively on health and emotional wellbeing. A fingernail sample provided a culturally acceptable, noninvasive method of measuring chronic stress in Indigenous and non-Indigenous young adults. Cortisol levels, a marker of chronic stress, were different between Indigenous and non-Indigenous young adults and were influenced by emotional status and occurrence of multiple stressful events.</AbstractText>"}

Increases in LE in the general and ID populations appear to follow similar trends. Some major causes of mortality in ID are similar to the general population, and therefore may be amenable to similar preventative healthcare interventions. In this article, we have outlined possible reasons for improved LE in ID, and potential areas that may require further intervention.

The current study used archival data to examine the potential impact of cognitive dysfunction on adherence to a nutritional supplement as part of a 90-day randomized clinical trial in neurologically healthy middle-aged and older adults.

This paper comprehensively reviews the physicochemical transformations of nZVI-based particles and the consequent effects on the particle's reactivity and toxicity. The corrosions of nZVI in water under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions are summarized. The transformation of contaminant-bearing nZVI is also discussed. Besides, the factors influencing the transformation of nZVI (i.e., pH, typical anions and cations, natural organic matter, surface stabilizers, bimetal decoration, and sulfidation treatment) are summarized and discussed. In addition, the effects of particle aging on its reactivity and toxicity are discussed. Generally, the aging of nZVI-based particles would have negative impact on the removal of contaminants, especially for the degradation of organic pollutants. However, the aging process of nZVI-based particles would cause a significant reduction in their toxicity. It is suggested that the nZVI-based particles would finally transform to less toxic or benign materials (i.e., iron (oxyhydr)oxides) over time. Finally, future perspectives are proposed to better quantify and predict the transformation of nZVI-based particles in aqueous environment. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The corrosion rates and products of nZVI in water varied much under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Typical anions and cations, natural organic matter, and iron types are critical factors influencing the physicochemical transformation of nZVI. The aging of nZVI would have negative impact its reactivity, especially for the degradation of organic pollutants. Although the fresh nZVI exhibits obvious toxicity, the aging process would cause a significant reduction in its toxicity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Water Environment Federation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

While the protective mechanisms are not fully understood in mammals, they are presumably mediated through metabolic regulation and suppression of protein translation by reduced phosphorylation of 4EBP1, a target of mTORC1. Using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and Gαq overexpression-induced heart failure models, we examined the effect of cardiac-specific heterozygous deletion (het) of Raptor, a component of mTORC1, and cardiac-specific transgenic overexpression of wild type or phosphorylation site mutant 4EBP1. In wild-type mice with TAC-induced heart failure, quantitative shotgun proteomics revealed decreased abundance of proteins of mitochondrial metabolism and increased abundance of proteins in oxidative stress response, ubiquitin, and other pathways. The Raptor het ameliorated both TAC- and Gαq overexpression-induced heart failure and the associated proteomic remodeling, especially those pathways involved in mitochondrial function, citric acid cycle, and ubiquitination. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of either wild type or mutant 4EBP1 aggravated TAC and Gαq, consistent with reduced adaptive hypertrophy by suppression of protein translation, in parallel with adverse remodeling of left ventricular proteomes. Partial mTORC1 inhibition by Raptor heterozygous deletion ameliorates heart failure and is associated with better preservation of the mitochondrial proteome; however, this effect does not appear to be mediated through suppression of protein translation by increased 4EBP1. Increased activity of 4EBP1 reduced adaptive hypertrophy and aggravated heart failure, suggesting that protein translation is essential for adaptive hypertrophy in pressure overload.</AbstractText>"}

It is involved in plant growth, development, maturation, and aging, and also helps ameliorate various types of abiotic and biotic stresses, including salt, drought, heavy metals, and pathogens. Melatonin-related growth and defense responses of plants are complex, and involve many signaling molecules. Among these, the most important one is nitric oxide (NO), a freely diffusing amphiphilic biomolecule that can easily cross the cell membrane, produce rapid signal responses, and participate in a wide variety of physiological reactions. NO-induced S-nitrosylation is also involved in plant defense responses. NO interacts with melatonin as a long-range signaling molecule, and helps regulate plant growth and maintain oxidative homeostasis. Exposure of plants to abiotic stresses causes the increase of endogenous melatonin levels, with the consequent up-regulation of melatonin synthesis genes, and further increase of melatonin content. The application of exogenous melatonin causes an increase in endogenous NO and up-regulation of defense-related transcription factors, resulting in enhanced stress resistance. When plants are infected by pathogenic bacteria, NO acts as a downstream signal to lead to increased melatonin levels, which in turn induces the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and associated defense responses. The application of exogenous melatonin can also promote sugar and glycerol production, leading to increased levels of salicylic acid and NO. Melatonin and NO in plants can function cooperatively to promote lateral root growth, delay aging, and ameliorate iron deficiency. Further studies are needed to clarify certain aspects of the melatonin/NO relationship in plant physiology.</AbstractText>"}

Installing home adaptations, from grab rails to walk in shower rooms, is cost effective, may prevent falls, reduce social isolation and improve self confidence. Despite austerity cuts to public spending, the UK government increased home adaptations' funding. However, not much is known about older people's experiences and understanding of acquiring and living with home adaptations and uptake of home adaptations could be improved. Using wearable camera and face to face interview data, this qualitative study explored a diverse group of older people's retrospective experiences (<i>n</i> = 30). Focus group discussions were also carried out with a wide range of professionals involved in the provision of home adaptations (<i>n</i> = 39). Findings suggest people may delay having adaptations, because of perceived stigmatising associations with decline and vulnerability. As delaying the installation of home adaptations until crisis point is known to reduce their effectiveness, such associations need to be challenged.</AbstractText>"}

The fact that the BSF deters HF oviposition is widely cited in BSF literature, but this interaction has not been assessed in over three decades. In this study, the competitive interaction of BSF and HF larvae was observed on fresh (day 0) and aged poultry manure (manure aged for two, four, six, or eight days). Specifically, a priority effect study was conducted to determine if colonization sequence influences time to first pupariation (HF) or pre-pupation (BSF), survivorship, and weight. Results show &gt;70% of HFs reached pupariation in all treatments except when placed on manure eight days after the initial inoculation with BSF. However, age of the resource negatively impacted time to first pupariation and puparium weight when HFs were reared alone or introduced two to eight days after BSF. No BSF pre-pupae resulted from treatments in which HFs were the pioneering species. BSFs reached the highest percent pre-pupation when reared alone on fresh manure, but BSFs may be more susceptible to the negative impacts of an aging resource, as no pre-pupae were observed when provided with six- or eight-day-old manure. Similar to HFs, age of the resource may have impacted development and survivorship; other factors such as moisture content, chemical composition, and amount of resource provided may have also impacted our results. These data may be useful in implementing BSFs as biological control agents of the HF, as well provide valuable information for facilities mass-producing HFs or BSFs for food or feed.</AbstractText>"}

Results showed that six plasma N-glycans (four increased and two decreased) were altered in PTSD vs. controls in both cohorts, but IgG N-glycans were similar between groups. The severity of PTSD was not associated with different plasma N-glycans. This is the first study detecting alterations in plasma N-glycans in PTSD. These N-glycans are also associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders and inflammation, suggesting possible shared glycosylation mechanisms.</AbstractText>"}

In terms of technological applications, quenching is considered a critical step, because detrimental quench-induced precipitation must be avoided to exploit the full age-hardening potential of the alloy. The alloy therefore needs to be quenched faster than a critical cooling rate, but slow enough to avoid undesired distortion and residual stresses. These contrary requirements for quenching can only be aligned based on detailed knowledge of the kinetics of quench-induced precipitation. Until the beginning of the 21st century, the kinetics of relevant solid-solid phase transformations in aluminium alloys could only be estimated by ex-situ testing of different properties. Over the past ten years, significant progress has been achieved in this field of materials science, enabled by the development of highly sensitive differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. This review presents a comprehensive report on the solid-solid phase transformation kinetics in Al alloys covering precipitation and dissolution reactions during heating from different initial states, dissolution during solution annealing and to a vast extent quench-induced precipitation during continuous cooling over a dynamic cooling rate range of ten orders of magnitude. The kinetic analyses are complemented by sophisticated micro- and nano-structural analyses and continuous cooling precipitation (CCP) diagrams are derived. The measurement of enthalpies released by quench-induced precipitation as a function of the cooling rate also enables predictions of the quench sensitivities of Al alloys using physically-based models. Various alloys are compared, and general aspects of quench-induced precipitation in Al alloys are derived.</AbstractText>"}

Alu DNA methylation was analyzed in sixty RASIG (randomly recruited age-stratified individuals from the general population) and thirty-two GO (GeHA offspring) enrolled in Italy in the framework of the MARK-AGE project. Factor analysis revealed a different clustering between Alu CpG1 and the other CpG sites. RASIG over 65 years showed lower Alu CpG1 methylation than those of GO subjects in the same age class. Moreover, Alu CpG1 methylation was associated with fruit and whole-grain bread consumption, LDL2-Cholesterol and plasma copper. The preserved Alu methylation status in GO, suggests Alu epigenetic changes as a potential marker of aging.

Research concerning the two-way relationship between depression and cognitive impairment has been conducted; however, there has been little analysis of cognitive function following changes in depressive status. This study describes the association between changes in depressive state and cognitive function in a Korean geriatric population sample. Using the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) database, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) indexes were used for measuring cognitive function and depression, respectively. The survey population was divided into four case categories by change in depressive status: normal to normal (Group A), normal to depressive (Group B), depressive to normal (Group C), and depressive to depressive (Group D). Analysis of variance, multiple regression analysis, and subgroup analysis were used for statistical examination. In the multiple regression analysis between MMSE values and depressive status change groups, with Group A as the reference, β in all other groups was negative, and its absolute value was large in the order of D, B, and C in both men (B: -0.717, C: -0.416, D: -1.539) and women (B: -0.629, C: -0.430, D: -1.143). There were also significant results in the subgroup analysis in terms of age, working status, participation in social activities, regular physical activities, and number of chronic medical conditions. In conclusion, both cases-those suffering from depression and those having suffered from it before-experience cognitive impairment. The degree of cognitive function being impaired is greater in the case of depression-onset than that of depression-remission. Age, stimulating activities, and chronic conditions are also strongly relevant to cognitive decline accompanied by changes in depressive state.</AbstractText>"}

However, the impact of the variability in the timing of food intake between weekends and weekdays on BMI (body mass index) remains unexplored. To address that, we propose to study a marker of the variability of meal timing on weekends versus weekdays (denominated as 'eating jet lag') that could be associated with increments in BMI. This cross-sectional study included 1106 subjects (aged 18-25 years). Linear regression models were used to examine the associations of eating jet lag with BMI and circadian related variables (including chronotype, eating duration, sleep duration, and social jet lag). Subsequently, a hierarchical multivariate regression analysis was conducted to determine whether the association of eating jet lag with BMI was independent of potentially confounding variables (e.g., chronotype and social jet lag). Moreover, restricted cubic splines were calculated to study the shape of the association between eating jet lag and BMI. Our results revealed a positive association between eating jet lag and BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.008), which was independent of the chronotype and social jet lag. Further analysis revealed the threshold of eating jet lag was of 3.5 h or more, from which the BMI could significantly increase. These results provided evidence of the suitability of the eating jet lag, as a marker of the variability in meal timing between weekends and weekdays, for the study of the influence of meal timing on obesity. In a long run, the reduction of the variability between meal timing on weekends versus weekdays could be included as part of food timing guidelines for the prevention of obesity among general population.</AbstractText>"}

Parkinson's disease (PD) has a multifactorial pathogenesis, involving both genetic and environmental and/or molecular co-factors. Generally, heterogeneous alterations in circadian rhythm (CR) are a typical finding in degenerative processes, such as cell aging and death. Although numerous genetic phenotypes have been discovered in the most common forms of PD, it seems that severe deficiencies in synaptic transmission and high vesicular recycling are frequently found in PD patients. Neuron-to-neuron interactions are often ensured by exosomes, a specific type of extracellular vesicle (EV). Neuron-derived exosomes may carry several active compounds, including miRNAs: Several studies have found that circulating miRNAs are closely associated with an atypical oscillation of circadian rhythm genes, and they are also involved in the regulation of clock genes, in animal models. In this context, a careful analysis of neural-differentiated Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and the molecular and genetic characterization of their exosome content, both in healthy cells and in PD-induced cells, could be a strategic field of investigation for early diagnosis and better treatment of PD and similar neurodegenerative pathologies. A novel MSC population, called human periapical cyst-mesenchymal stem cells (hPCy-MSCs), has demonstrated that it naively expresswa the main neuronal markers, and may differentiate towards functional neurons. Therefore, hPCy-MSCs can be considered of particular interest for testing of in vitro strategies to treat neurological diseases. On the other hand, the limitations of using stem cells is an issue that leads researchers to perform experimental studies on the exosomes released by MCSs.

Safe and selective means to stimulate epidermal pigmentation associated with oxidative stress defense are; however, scarce. Activation of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) on epidermal melanocytes represents a key step in cutaneous pigmentation initiation and, additionally, it regulates cellular defense mechanisms like oxidative stress and DNA-repair. Thus, making the activation of MC1R an attractive strategy for modulating skin pigmentation and oxidative stress. In this context, we designed and synthesized pentapeptides that act as MC1R agonists. These peptides bound, with high potency, to MC1R and activated cAMP synthesis in CHO cells expressing human MC1R. Using one lead pentapeptide, we could show that this activation of MC1R was specific as testing the activation of other G-protein coupled receptors, including the MC-receptor family, was negative. In vitro efficacy on mouse melanoma cells showed similar potency as for the synthetic MC1R agonist alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (NDP-alpha-MSH). Moreover, we could reproduce this activity in human skin tissue culture. The lead pentapeptide was able to induce ex-vivo protein expression of key melanogenesis markers melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase (TYR), and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP-1). Concerning oxidative stress response, we found that the pentapeptide enhanced the activation of Nrf2 after UVA-irradiation. Our results make this pentapeptide an ideal candidate as a skin pigmentation enhancer that mimics alpha-MSH and may also have anti-photoaging effects on the skin.</AbstractText>"}

Common methods are orchiectomy and ovariectomy/ovariohysterectomy. GnRH superagonist implants are available in some areas. Alternative methods like vasectomy and salpingectomy/hysterectomy are uncommon. The terminology used to describe desexing is inconsistent and contradictory, showing a need for the adaption of standardized terminology. <i>Population Control</i>: Surprisingly, empirical studies show no effects of desexing on population control in companion and shelter dogs despite desexing being consistently recommended in the literature. There is evidence for a population control effect in free-roaming dogs, where desexing also has benefits on zoonotic disease and bite risk. Population control in free-roaming dogs is mostly correlated with female, not male desexing. <i>Health and Lifespan</i>: Desexing affects numerous disease risks, but studies commonly neglect age at diagnosis and overall lifespan, age being by far the most important risk factor for most diseases. We argue that lifespan is a more important outcome than ultimate cause of death. A beneficial effect of desexing on lifespan is consistently demonstrated in females, while evidence for a beneficial effect in males is inconsistent. Studies are likely biased in desexing being a proxy for better care and desexed dogs having already lived to the age of desexing. Desexing reduces or eliminates common life-limiting diseases of the female reproductive system such as pyometra and mammary tumors, while no analogous effect exists in males. Disease risks increases across sexes and breeds include cruciate ligament rupture, various cancers, and obesity. Urinary incontinence risk is increased in females only. Various other disease risk changes show considerable variability between breeds and sexes. <i>Behavioral Effects</i>: Desexed males show reduced libido, roaming, conspecific mounting, and urinary marking frequency, as well as reduced male dog-directed aggression in a majority of males desexed for behavioral reasons. There is a detrimental effect on the risk and progression of age-related cognitive dysfunction. Desexed dogs may be less likely to cause bite injuries across sexes. The evidence for other effects such as human-directed aggression, human or object mounting, resource guarding, or shyness and anxiety is inconsistent and contradictory. There are few studies specific to females or individual breeds. <i>Conclusions</i>: The evidence for a beneficial effect of desexing is stronger in female than in male dogs; however, there is significant variation between breeds and sexes, and more research is needed to further elucidate these differences and to arrive at individualized evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.</AbstractText>"}

In an oil-immersed transformer, the normal aging, thermal failure, and discharge failure could easily lead to the decomposition of the oil-paper insulation system and produce different kinds of gases. Studying gas dissolution in natural ester and mineral oil could provide assistance in applying criteria to make a diagnosis of different kinds of faults in the transformer. In this paper, the molecular dynamics method was used to investigate the diffusion behavior of seven fault characteristic gases (including H<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) in natural ester and mineral oil. The simulation parameters of free volume, interaction energy, mean square displacement, and diffusion coefficient were compared between the natural ester and mineral oil. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature on the diffusion of gas molecules in two kinds of oils was also analyzed. Results showed that the free volume, the interaction energy, and the relative molecular mass of gas molecules were the factors influenced by the diffusion of gas molecules in natural ester and mineral oil. The order of the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in natural ester was as follows: H<sub>2</sub> &gt; CH<sub>4</sub> &gt; CO &gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> &gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> &gt; CO<sub>2</sub> &gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and that in mineral oil was as follows: H<sub>2</sub> &gt; CH<sub>4</sub> &gt; CO&gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> &gt; C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> &gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> &gt; CO<sub>2</sub>. By comparing the diffusion behavior of gas molecules in natural ester and mineral oil, it was found that the smaller free volume and higher interaction energy of gas molecules in natural ester were the major reasons for the gas molecules to be more difficult to diffuse in natural ester. The rising temperature could enhance the free volume and reduce the interaction energy between gas molecules and oil. The diffusion coefficient of gas molecules increased exponentially with the follow of temperature. However, the temperature didn't affect the ordering of diffusion coefficient, free volume, and interaction energy of gas molecules in natural ester and mineral oil.</AbstractText>"}

Local bone infections were treated with antibiotics directly or by controlled drug-releasing scaffolds, like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres, which have to be removed at a later stage, but there is a risk of a bacterial contamination during the removement. Therefore, biomaterials loaded with antibiotics for controlled release could be the method of choice: The biomaterials degrade during the drug release, therefore, there is no need for a second surgery to remove the drug eluting agent. Even non-resorbable bone materials are available (e.g., hydroxyapatite (HA)) or resorbable bone graft materials (e.g., beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP)) that will be replaced by newly formed bone. Composite materials with organic additives (e.g., collagen) supports the handling during surgery and enhances the drug loading capacity, as well as the drug releasing time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the loading capacity and the release rate of Vancomycin and Gentamicin on TCP and HA granules in the shape of a degradable scaffold compared to composite materials from TCP mixed with porcine collagen. Its antibacterial efficacy to a more elementary drug with eluting in aqueous solution was examined. The loading capacity of the biomaterials was measured and compared according to the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of a bacterial biofilm after 24 h aging. Antibiotic elution and concentration of gentamycin and vancomycin, as well as inhibition zones, were measured by using the Quantitative Microparticle Systems (QMS) immunoassays. The antibiotic concentration was determined by the automated Beckman Coulter (BC) chemistry device. For examination of the antibacterial activity, inhibition zone diameters were measured. Generally, the antibiotic release is more pronounced during the first couple of days than later. Both TCP granules and HA granules experienced a significantly decline of antibiotics release during the first three days. After the fourth day and beyond, the antibiotic release was below the detection threshold. The antibiotic release of the composite material TCP and porcine collagen declined less drastically and was still in the frame of the specification during the first nine days. There was no significant evidence of interaction effect between antibiotic and material, i.e., the fitted lines for Gentamycin and Vancomycin are almost parallel. During this first in vitro study, β-TCP-Collagen composites shows a significantly higher loading capacity and a steadily release of the antibiotics Gentamycin and Vancomycin, compared to the also used TCP and HA Granules.</AbstractText>"}

Comparing performance of ML models used in various studies can be problematic due to different walking protocols and gait assessment systems. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of walking protocols and gait assessment systems on the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) for classification of PD. 93 PD and 103 controls performed two walking protocols at their normal pace: (i) four times along a 10 m walkway (intermittent walk-IW), (ii) walking for 2 minutes on a 25 m oval circuit (continuous walk-CW). 14 gait characteristics were extracted from two different systems (an instrumented walkway-GAITRite; and an accelerometer attached at the lower back-Axivity). SVM and RF were trained on normalized data (accounting for step velocity, gender, age and BMI) and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation with area under the curve (AUC). Overall performance was higher for both systems during CW compared to IW. SVM performed better than RF. With SVM, during CW Axivity significantly outperformed GAITRite (AUC: 87.83 ± 7.81% vs. 80.49 ± 9.85%); during IW systems performed similarly. These findings suggest that choice of testing protocol and sensing system may have a direct impact on ML PD classification results and highlight the need for standardization for wide scale implementation.</AbstractText>"}

This paper addresses the design of a supportive sonic environment for persons with dementia in nursing homes. Starting from a review of key mechanisms related to sonic perception, cognitive deficits and related behavior, a framework is derived for the composition of a sonic environment for persons with dementia. The proposed framework is centered around using acoustic stimuli for influencing mood, stimulating the feeling of safety and triggering a response in a person. These stimuli are intended to be deployed as added sounds in a nursing home to improve the well-being and behavior of the residents.</AbstractText>"}

Focusing on muscle strength as the key component of sarcopenia, the aim of this overview was to evaluate its links to nutrition, both to variation in habitual diets in older populations, as well as considering supplementation effects in trials. A main message from the reviewed studies is that while many provide suggestive evidence of benefits of higher nutrient intakes and diets of higher quality, findings are inconsistent, and data on muscle strength are often lacking. To assess the potential of optimising diets as a strategy to promote and maintain muscle strength, gaps in current evidence need to be addressed. These include the need for (i) better understanding of individual differences in responsiveness to dietary change, and the need for targeted nutritional support; (ii) clearer distinction between protective and therapeutic actions of diet; and (iii) definition of the role of dietary patterns and their influence on muscle strength, to allow effects of changes in food consumption to be evaluated-particularly when combined with physical activity. Development of this evidence is needed to enable translation into appropriate dietary recommendations for older populations.</AbstractText>"}

Hyperactive STAT3 and STAT5 are also implicated in various hematopoietic and solid malignancies, such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma or prostate cancer. Classical understanding of STAT functions is linked to their phosphorylated parallel dimer conformation, in which they induce gene transcription. However, the functions of STAT proteins are not limited to their phosphorylated dimerization form. In this review, we discuss the functions and the roles of unphosphorylated STAT3/5 in the context of chromatin remodeling, as well as the impact of STAT5 oligomerization on differential gene expression in hematopoietic neoplasms. The central involvement of STAT3/5 in cancer has made these molecules attractive targets for small-molecule drug development, but currently there are no direct STAT3/5 inhibitors of clinical grade available.

In this, thin-film polypropylene samples exposed to standard artificial ultraviolet radiation in accelerated aging from 1 day to 30 days are closely monitored by a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system and analyzed using an effective data processing method. It is found that the terahertz absorption of the polypropylene samples is generally weak and the terahertz dielectric constant varies slightly though discernibly during the aging process, with the refractive index decreasing slightly with increasing length of ultraviolet exposure. Nonetheless, the rate of variation of the polypropylene refractive index with increasing terahertz frequency exhibits a drastic inflection around the 15-days aging point and the rate changes suddenly from positive value to negative value. Based on this prominent and consistent THz dielectric spectroscopic feature of the aging process, an efficient judging criterion is established to distinguish the early-term, mid-term, and late-term phases as well as the degree of polypropylene ultraviolet aging, corresponding to the fundamental transformation of the polymer material from a nonpolar to a polar substance at a critical level of oxidation induced by ultraviolet radiation.</AbstractText>"}

In the memory test, the 7.5% okara-fed mice showed a longer step-through latency and the 15% okara-fed mice had a short escape latency compared with control mice. The 15% okara-fed mice displayed decreased body weight, increased fecal weight, and altered cecal microbiota composition compared with the control group; however, there was no significant difference in the serum lactic acid and butyric acid levels among these mice groups. The 7.5% okara-fed mice had significantly higher NeuN intensity in the hippocampus compared with control mice. Furthermore, a decrease in inflammatory cytokine TNF- and an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed in the 7.5% okara-fed group. The expression of synthesizing enzyme of acetylcholine was increased by the okara diets, and the acetylcholine level in the brain was higher in the 7.5% okara-fed group than in the control.

The review covers key aroma components of aromatic grapes, raisins and raisinized grapes, and the aroma components responsible from green and vegetal notes. This knowledge is used to explain the flavor properties of neutral grapes. The aroma potential of grape is the consequence of five different systems/pools of specific aroma precursors that during fermentation and/or aging, release wine varietal aroma. In total, 27 relevant wine aroma compounds can be considered that proceed from grape specific precursors.

However, current treatment regimens remain inaccessible to most patients, particularly in developing countries, and, therefore, the development of a novel vaccine capable of protecting subjects from chronic infection by HCV could greatly reduce the rates of HCV infection, subsequent liver pathogenesis, and in some cases death. Herein, we evaluated two different semi-synthetic archaeosome formulations as an adjuvant to the E1/E2 HCV envelope protein in a murine model and compared antigen-specific humoral (levels of anti-E1/E2 IgG and HCV pseudoparticle neutralization) and cellular responses (numbers of antigen-specific cytokine-producing T cells) to those generated with adjuvant formulations composed of mimetics of commercial adjuvants including a squalene oil-in-water emulsion, aluminum hydroxide/monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and liposome/MPLA/QS-21. In addition, we measured the longevity of these responses, tracking humoral, and cellular responses up to 6 months following vaccination. Overall, we show that the strength and longevity of anti-HCV responses can be influenced by adjuvant selection. In particular, a simple admixed sulfated S-lactosylarchaeol (SLA) archaeosome formulation generated strong levels of HCV neutralizing antibodies and polyfunctional antigen-specific CD4 T cells producing multiple cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2.

The aim of this study was to investigate Ti-Cu<sub>x</sub> alloys, exploring how Cu content (up to 10 wt%) and ageing affect the material properties. Electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, hardness testing, bacteriological culture, and electrochemical testing were employed to characterize the materials.

This disorder is characterized by the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques (Aβ) resulting from impaired amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, together with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. The exacerbated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers the process called oxidative stress, which increases neuronal cell abnormalities, most often followed by apoptosis, leading to cognitive dysfunction and dementia. In this context, the development of new therapies for the AD treatment is necessary. Antioxidants, for instance, are promising species for prevention and treatment because they are capable of disrupting the radical chain reaction, reducing the production of ROS. These species have also proven to be adjunctive to conventional treatments making them more effective. In this sense, several recently published works have focused their attention on oxidative stress and antioxidant species.

The paint industry has changed significantly throughout the twentieth century, frequently altering its manufacturing techniques in order to achieve paints with improved appearance, application and performance for a range of diverse household, industrial and artistic uses. This has led to the appearance and use of a multitude of new binding media, pigments and additives, most of which require new analytical methods for their identification. Concrete art is the name given to a significant art movement that took place in Argentina (and other nearby countries) during the 1940s and 1950s, at the exact same time as a flourishing paint industry was utilizing many of these new products and diversifying formulas. This paper reports on some initial findings from a long-term study to develop and apply analytical methodologies on paint samples from a number of Concrete artworks, that will help to better understand art history and advance the conservation field by shedding light on these artist's painting techniques, and the ageing behavior of their materials. Specifically, samples of white paints manufactured by local paint companies in Argentina from that time period were purchased and studied with a multi-analytical approach, which will serve as a reference collection for the field. The analytical techniques used were X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with previous derivatization. Artworks samples were studied with a similar multi-analytical approach, and utilized micro-Raman spectroscopy instead of XRD, for its non-destructive application. A wide range of possible compounds was identified due to the complementarity use of analytical techniques, representing a significant first step in Argentinian modern art research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has been shown that a disturbance of normal iron metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of AD. However, the mechanism underlying abnormal iron load in the brain of AD patients is unclear. The frontal cortex, an important brain structure for executive function, is one of the regions affected by AD. We investigated the beneficial effects of active compounds of Epimedium, Astragaoside and Puerarin on iron metabolism in the frontal cortex of six-month-old APPswe/PS1<sub>ΔE9</sub> (APP/PS1) double transgenic mouse, a model of AD. Treatment with the active compounds reduced cognitive and memory deficits and damaged cell ultrastructure in APP/PS1 mice. These beneficial effects were associated with changes in expression levels of iron metabolism proteins in the frontal cortex, including divalent metal transporter with iron response element (DMT1-with IRE), divalent metal transporter without iron response element (DMT1-without IRE), transferrin (TF) and transferring receptor 1 (TfR1); three release proteins including the exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn1), ceruloplasmin (CP) and hephaestin (HEPH), one increased storage iron protein ferritin and one iron regulating hormone hepcidin. These findings suggest that the active compounds improve cognition and memory in brain neurodegenerative disorders and these beneficial effects are associated with reduced impairment of iron metabolism. This study may provide a new strategy for developing novel drugs to treat AD.</AbstractText>"}

The present study aimed to explore the role of RBM8A in Alzheimer's disease (AD). RBM8A is significantly down-regulated in AD. Interestingly, 9186 differentially expressed genes are overlapped from comparisons of AD versus control and RBM8A-low versus RBM8A-high. Weight gene correlation analysis was performed and 9 functional modules were identified. Modules positively correlated with AD and RBM8A-low are significantly involved in the RAP1 signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, hematopoietic cell lineage, autophagy and APELIN signaling pathway. Fifteen genes (RBM8A, RHBDF2, TNFRSF10B, ACP1, ANKRD39, CA10, CAMK4, CBLN4, LOC284214, NOVA1, PAK1, PPEF1, RGS4, TCEB1 and TMEM118) are identified as hub genes, and the hub gene-based LASSO model can accurately predict the occurrence of AD (AUC = 0.948). Moreover, the RBM8A-module-pathway network was constructed, and low expression of RBM8A down-regulates multiple module genes, including FIP200, Beclin 1, NRBF2, VPS15 and ATG12, which composes key complexes of autophagy. Thus, our study supports that low expression of RBM8A correlates with the decrease of the components of key complexes in autophagy, which could potentially contribute to pathophysiological changes of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Histones PTMs play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and are critical for the development and progression of many types of cancer, including breast cancer. In this study, we used two-dimensional TAU/SDS electrophoresis, coupled with mass spectrometry for a comprehensive profiling of histone PTMs in breast cancer cell lines.Proteomic approach allowed us to identify 85 histone PTMs, seventeen of which are not reported in the UniProt database. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm a peculiar pattern of PTMs in the sporadic and hereditary breast cancer cell lines compared to normal cells. Overlapping mass spectrometry data with western blotting results, we identified, for the first time to our knowledge, a tyrosine phosphorylation on histone H1, which is significantly higher in breast cancer cells. Additionally, by inhibiting specific signaling paths, such as PI3K, PPARγ and FAK pathways, we established a correlation between their regulation and the presence of new histone PTMs. Our results may provide new insight on the possible implication of these modifications in breast cancer and may offer new perspectives for future clinical applications.</AbstractText>"}

Such oxidative stress is accelerated by an age-related loss of critical antioxidants like glutathione (GSH) and dietary solutions to combat this loss does not exist. While egg white is rich in sulphur amino acids (AAs), precursors for GSH biosynthesis, whether they can increase sulphur AA in vivo and augment GSH in the aged myocardium remain unclear. We hypothesized that egg white consumption increases GSH and reduces oxidative damage and inflammation in the geriatric heart. To this end, 101-102 week-old mice were given a AIN 76A diet supplemented with either 9% w/w egg white powder or casein for 8 weeks. Subsequent analysis revealed that egg white increased serum sulphur AA and cardiac GSH, while reducing the cysteine carrying transporter SNAT-2 and elevating glutamine transporter ASCT2 in the heart. Increased GSH was accompanied by elevated expression of GSH biosynthesis enzyme glutathione synthase as well as mitochondrial antioxidants like superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase 1 in egg white-fed hearts. These hearts also demonstrated lower oxidative damage of lipids (4-hydroxynonenal) and proteins [nitrotyrosine] with elevated anti-inflammatory IL-10 gene expression. These data demonstrate that even at the end of lifespan, egg whites remain effective in promoting serum sulphur AAs and preserve cardiac GSH with potent anti-oxidant and mild anti-inflammatory effects in the geriatric myocardium. We conclude that egg white intake may be an effective dietary strategy to attenuate oxidative damage in the senescent heart.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Multiple neurodegeneration diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), are public health challenges. Every year, countless efforts are expended trying to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of neurological disorders, which are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction to some extent. Numerous studies have shown that mtUPR is involved in and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, but the exact mechanism of the disorders is still unclear. Further study of the process of mtUPR in neurological disorders can help us more accurately understand their pathogenesis in order to provide new therapeutic targets.

So far, aging and, eventually, death are unavoidable. Nevertheless, research efforts on aging-associated diseases with the aim not only to extend life span but also to increment health span in an attempt to delay, stop and even reverse the aging process have not stopped growing. Caloric restriction extends both health and life span in several short-lived experimental models and has brought to light the role of different molecular effectors involved in nutrient sensing pathways and longevity. This opens the possibility of modulating these molecular effectors also in humans to increase longevity and health span. The difficulty to implement caloric restricted diets in humans has led to the development of new bearable diets such as time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting or diets with limited amounts of some nutrients and to the search of pharmacological agents, targeted to the effectors that mediate the extension of life and health span in response to these anti-aging diets. Pharmacological approaches that eliminate senescent cells or prevent primary causes of aging such as telomere attrition also emerge as potential anti-aging strategies.

NAMPT is a rate-limiting enzyme for NAD<sup>+</sup> production in mammalian cells and it was suggested that NAMPT and NMNAT3 are responsible for mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> production to maintain mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> pool. However, subsequent studies suggested mitochondrial may lack the NAMPT-NMANT3 pathway to maintain NAD<sup>+</sup> level. Therefore, how NAMPT overexpression rescues mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> content to promote cell survival in response to genotoxic stress remains elusive. Here, we show that NAMPT promotes cell survival under oxidative stress via both SIRT1 dependent p53-CD38 pathway and SIRT1 independent NRF2-PPARα/AMPKα pathway, and the NRF2-PPARα/AMPKα pathway plays a more profound role in facilitating cell survival than the SIRT1-p53-CD38 pathway does. Mitochondrial content and membrane potential were significantly reduced in response to H2O2 treatment, whereas activated NRF2-PPARα/AMPKα pathway by NAMPT overexpression rescued the mitochondrial membrane potential and content, suggesting that maintained mitochondrial content and integrity by NAMPT overexpression might be one of the key mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> level and subsequently dictate cell survival under oxidative stress. Our results indicated that NRF2 is a novel down-stream target of NAMPT, which mediates anti-apoptosis function of NAMPT via maintaining mitochondrial content and membrane potential.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, one inexpensive and non-invasive biomarker which could help is electroencephalography (EEG). Previous studies have shown that the brain network architecture assessed by EEG is altered in AD patients compared with age-matched healthy control people (HC). However, similar studies in Lewy body diseases, that is, DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are still lacking. In this work, we (a) compared brain network connectivity patterns across conditions, AD, DLB and PDD, in order to infer EEG network biomarkers that differentiate between these conditions, and (b) tested whether opting for weighted matrices led to more reliable results by better preserving the topology of the network. Our results indicate that dementia groups present with reduced connectivity in the EEG α band, whereas DLB shows weaker posterior-anterior patterns within the β-band and greater network segregation within the θ-band compared with AD. Weighted network measures were more consistent across global thresholding levels, and the network properties reflected reduction in connectivity strength in the dementia groups. In conclusion, β- and θ-band network measures may be suitable as biomarkers for discriminating DLB from AD, whereas the α-band network is similarly affected in DLB and PDD compared with HC. These variations may reflect the impairment of attentional networks in Parkinsonian diseases such as DLB and PDD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, there could be other factors affecting the incidence of deaths besides climate, for example, differences in regional death investigation systems. Here, we aimed to elucidate other such factors affecting the mortality data of drowning in the bathtub, especially the effects of discontinuing the medical examiner system. Police data in Kyoto and ambulatory care information in Yokohama were used. Data on cases of elderly individuals found dying or dead in the bathtub at home in winter 2014-2015 were obtained. The following data were collected for each case: age, gender, presence/absence of ambulatory transport, performance of autopsy, and cause of death. The autopsy and drowning rates in Kyoto were 0%, whereas both values in Yokohama were significantly higher at 93.1% and 89.4%, respectively (the denominator of each of the rates is the total number of elderly (aged 65 or over) individuals found dying or dead in the bathtub at home in each city during each winter). Despite no significant difference of incidence of total bath-related death, the proportion of drowning-related deaths was overwhelmingly higher in Yokohama than in Kyoto. The difference can be attributed to the difference in autopsy rates between the two cities, mainly caused by the presence/absence of a medical examiner system. Therefore, we should pay careful attention to future changes in autopsy/drowning rates in Yokohama, and ascertain whether the change might be continuously influenced by the abolishment of this system.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We investigated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, mitochondrial membrane permeability, AIF expression level, nucleus apoptosis, shear force, myofibril fragmentation index, pH, and energy level. According to the results, a rise in ROS content was accompanied by the rise in mitochondrial membrane permeability from 6 to 72 hr. In the meantime, the AIF expression in mitochondria was downregulated significantly within 72 hr. However, samples treated with N-acetylcysteine had significantly lower ROS content (6 to 72 hr) and mitochondrial membrane permeability (12 to 72 hr) than the control group. Moreover, during postmortem aging, the variations in AIF levels in mitochondria were closely associated with meat tenderization and nucleus apoptosis. These findings demonstrated that oxidative stress induced by ROS significantly promoted AIF release from mitochondria by enhancing the mitochondrial membrane permeability, and the released AIF mediated nucleus apoptosis that further enhanced bovine muscle tenderness. Besides, results suggest that in the early stage, the environmental factors (ATP content and pH) significantly decreased (0 to 72 hr), whereas ROS-induced oxidative stress had no significant effect on environmental factors. These observations further suggested that during postmortem aging, the decrease of pH and ATP consumption are required by AIF release. We conclude that ROS-induced oxidative stress and internal environment are vital for meat tenderization through the regulation of AIF-mediated apoptosis pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: ROS-induced oxidative stress contributes to bovine muscle tenderization by promoting cell apoptosis. It is likely to lay a theoretical foundation for developing innovative tenderization techniques by altering the internal oxidation environment of postmortem muscles.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</CopyrightInformation>"}

HRS cells exhibit near-universal somatic copy gains of chromosome 9p/9p24.1, which increase expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligands. To define genetic mechanisms of response and resistance to PD-1 blockade and identify complementary treatment targets, we performed whole-exome sequencing of flow cytometry-sorted HRS cells from 23 excisional biopsies of newly diagnosed cHLs, including 8 Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) tumors. We identified significantly mutated cancer candidate genes (CCGs) as well as somatic copy number alterations and structural variations and characterized their contribution to disease-defining immune evasion mechanisms and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT, and PI3K signaling pathways. EBV- cHLs had a higher prevalence of genetic alterations in the NF-κB and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathways. In this young cHL cohort (median age, 26 years), we identified a predominant mutational signature of spontaneous deamination of cytosine- phosphate-guanines ('Aging'), in addition to apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like, activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated hypermutation. In particular, the mutational burden in EBV- cHLs was among the highest reported, similar to that of carcinogen-induced tumors. Together, the overall high mutational burden, MSI-associated hypermutation, and newly identified genetic alterations represent additional potential bases for the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in cHL. Of note, recurrent cHL alterations, including B2M, TNFAIP3, STAT6, GNA13, and XPO1 mutations and 2p/2p15, 6p21.32, 6q23.3, and 9p/9p24.1 copy number alterations, were also identified in &gt;20% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas, highlighting shared pathogenetic mechanisms in these diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

AP sites arise due to damage-induced (e.g. alkylation) or spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond that links the base to the sugar moiety of the phosphodiester backbone, or through the enzymatic activity of DNA glycosylases, which release inappropriate bases as part of the base excision repair (BER) response. Unrepaired AP sites, which lack instructional information, have the potential to cause mutagenesis or to arrest progressing DNA or RNA polymerases, potentially causing outcomes such as cellular transformation, senescence or death. The predominant enzyme in humans responsible for repairing AP lesions is AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). Besides being a powerful AP endonuclease, APE1 possesses additional DNA repair activities, such as 3'-5' exonuclease, 3'-phophodiesterase and nucleotide incision repair. In addition, APE1 has been shown to stimulate the DNA-binding activity of a number of transcription factors through its 'REF1' function, thereby regulating gene expression. In this article, we review the structural and biochemical features of this multifunctional protein, while reporting on new structures of the APE1 variants Cys65Ala and Lys98Ala. Using a functional complementation approach, we also describe the importance of the repair and REF1 activities in promoting cell survival, including the proposed passing-the-baton coordination in BER. Finally, results are presented indicating a critical role for APE1 nuclease activities in resistance to the genotoxins methyl methanesulphonate and bleomycin, supporting biologically important functions as an AP endonuclease and 3'-phosphodiesterase, respectively.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The UK Environmental Mutagen Society 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Within each group, color stability was measured on half the sample (n = 10) using a UV-2450 visible UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu), and Knoop hardness was measured on the other half (n = 10) using an HMV 2000 microhardness tester (Shimadzu) before and after thermocycling (12,000 cycles, 5°C and 55°C). Mann-Whitney test was performed on the color stability data; the microhardness data were analyzed using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (α = .05). The ANOVA results showed that thermocycling, distinct light intensity, and different colors of resin materials influenced the microhardness of the composite resins, which was evidenced by the A3 composite resin light-cured with a Valo polywave showing higher hardness values. There was no statistical difference in the color stability of the A3 composite resin; however, the C3 composite resin light-cured with an EC 450 singlewave light-curing unit showed higher color alteration values. In general, the Valo polywave light-curing unit imparted better mechanical property and color stability to both shades of the composite resins. The different shades of resin material influenced the hardness of the composite resins. Therefore, the light intensity of the light-curing units should be evaluated and monitored, as the amount of light intensity will interfere in the quality and longevity of resin restorations.</AbstractText>"}

TDP-43 proteinopathy associated with LATE has been identified in more than 20% of autopsies of community-dwelling adults over the age of 80. It is believed to contribute significantly toward tau-negative dementia. Heavy metals such as lead has also been linked to TDP-43 proteinopathy. In particular, lead triggers TDP-43 accumulation and disrupts TDP-43 homeostasis. However, the specific relationship between LATE and lead remains unknown. Before leaded gasoline was phased out during the 1970s and 1980s, average blood lead levels were 15 times what they are today. Thus, each successive birth cohort entering old age has had less cumulative life exposure to lead. Lifetime exposure can be tracked in the tibia bone, where the half-life of lead is many decades. We hypothesize that lead plays a role in the development of LATE. There are two ways to explore the validity of this hypothesis. Generational differences in lead exposure should result in a steady decline in the prevalence of LATE among older adults. We propose the use of tibia bone lead levels be examined in brain autopsies from different birth cohorts to examine the link between lead exposure and LATE prevalence, holding age constant. Furthermore, individuals with genetic polymorphisms that confer a greater lead absorption phenotype should display a higher degree of TDP-43 accumulation in autopsies. The results of such studies could provide insight into gene by environment interactions relevant to the development of LATE.</AbstractText>"}

However, randomized controlled trials have not shown clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation could improve cognitive outcomes. In fact, some studies reported the association between vitamin D and cognitive impairment based on individuals aged 60 years and over. However, it is still unclear that whether vitamin D levels are causally associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in individuals aged 60 years and over. Here, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal association between vitamin D levels and AD using a large-scale vitamin D genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset and two large-scale AD GWAS datasets from the IGAP and UK Biobank with individuals aged 60 years and over. Our results showed that genetically increased 25OHD levels were significantly associated with reduced AD risk individuals aged 60 years and over. Hence, our findings in combination with previous literature indicate that maintaining adequate vitamin D status in older people especially aged 60 years and over, may contribute to slow down cognitive decline and to forestall AD. Long-term randomized controlled trials are required to test whether vitamin D supplementation may prevent AD in older people especially those aged 60 years and may be recommended as preventive agents.</AbstractText>"}

In addition, recent research shows that vascular dysfunction not only potentiates AD pathology, but that pathological changes in AD may subsequently induce vascular disorders. On the basis of these data, we propose that the neurobiological underpinnings underlying AD/VaD dementia and their neuropsychological phenotypes are best understood as existing along a clinical/pathological continuum or spectrum. We further propose that in conjunction with current diagnostic criteria, statistical modeling techniques using neuropsychological test performance should be leveraged to construct a system to classify AD/VaD spectrum dementia in order to test hypotheses regarding how mechanisms related to AD and VaD pathology interact and influence each other.</AbstractText>"}

Exposure to SHS was assessed with serum cotinine concentrations. Grip strength was measured using a Takei digital handgrip dynamometer, and combined grip strength was calculated as the sum of the largest reading from each hand. Median (interquartile range) serum cotinine and grip strength were 0.015 ng/mL (IQR 0.011-0.36) and 65.5 kg (IQR 53.4-86.4), respectively. After adjusting for sociodemographic, anthropometric, health-related behavioral, and clinical risk factors, the highest (0.047-9.9 ng/mL) vs lowest (≤0.011 ng/mL) quartile of serum cotinine was associated with a reduction in combined grip strength of 1.41 kg (95%CI: -2.58, -0.24), p-trend=0.02. These results were consistent across socio-demographic and clinical subgroups. In the US nonsmoking adult population, even low levels of exposure to passive smoking were associated with decreased grip strength.

These diseases are always fatal and have long asymptomatic incubation periods. By 2019, CWD-infected cervids had been detected in 26 states, three Canadian provinces, South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Prions (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) replicate by inducing a normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) to adopt the prion conformation. This prion templated conformational conversion is influenced by PrP<sup>C</sup> polymorphisms. Cervid PrP<sup>C</sup> contains at least 20 different polymorphic sites. By using chymotrypsin, trypsin, or trypsin followed by chymotrypsin to digest denatured cervid PrP, 19 peptides suitable for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based analysis and spanning positions 30-51, 61-112, and 114-231 of cervid PrP were identified. Ten of these peptides span polymorphism-containing regions of cervid PrP. The other nine contain no polymorphisms, so they can be used as internal standards. Calibration curves relating the area ratios of MRM signals from polymorphism-containing peptides to appropriate internal standard peptides were linear and had excellent correlation coefficients. Samples from heterozygous (G<sub>96</sub>/S<sub>96</sub>) white-tailed deer orally dosed with CWD from homozygous (G<sub>96</sub>/G<sub>96</sub>) deer were analyzed. The G<sub>96</sub> polymorphism comprised 75 ± 5% of the total PrP from the G<sub>96</sub>/S<sub>96</sub> heterozygotes. Heterozygous animals facilitate conversion of different PrP<sup>C</sup> polymorphisms into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.

We quantified cortical excitability dynamics during prolonged wakefulness as a sensitive marker of age-related alteration in sleep-wake regulation in 60 healthy older individuals (50-69 y; 42 women). Brain structural integrity was assessed with amyloid-beta- and tau-PET, and with MRI. Participants' cognition was investigated using an extensive neuropsychological task battery. We show that individuals with preserved wake-dependent cortical excitability dynamics exhibit better cognitive performance, particularly in the executive domain which is essential to successful cognitive aging. Critically, this association remained significant after accounting for brain structural integrity measures.

The purpose of this study was to characterize new mechanism of acquired Cetuximab resistance. Firstly, tissue microarrays (TMA) comprising 191 CRC patients was constructed to evaluate the expression of chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) by using immunohistochemistry (IHC). In CRC tumor tissues, CCR7 was significantly over-expressed compared with paired normal tissues (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and correlated with the infiltration depth (<i>P</i> = 0.03) and the regional lymph node metastasis (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Significant differences were also found in forms of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between normal and tumor tissues (<i>P &lt; 0.001</i>). More interestingly, EGFR was also highly expressed and co-localized with CCR7 in the tumor tissues from the patients who were insensitive to Cetuximab treatment. Secondly, we further explored the relationship between CCR7 expression and Cetuximab resistance by two CCR7 positive CRC cell lines, Caco-2 with wild-type <i>KRAS</i> (<i>KRAS<sup>wt</sup></i> ) and HCT116 with mutated <i>KRAS</i> (<i>KRAS<sup>G13D</sup></i> ). By the treatment of secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC, an exogenous high-affinity legend of CCR7), the inhibition rate of Cetuximab significantly decreased in both cells. Furthermore, the activation of SLC/CCR7 axis promoted epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in CRC tumor cells by increasing the expression of Twist and β-catenin. By using of CCR7 neutralizing antibody and p-AKT inhibitor rescued the above effects. These findings suggested that CCR7 was a key factor in those CRC patients, who have poorer reaction to Cetuximab. So combined inhibition of CCR7 and p-AKT will represent a rational therapeutic strategy for Cetuximab resistance patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>AJCR Copyright © 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Many studies focusing on telomeres have revealed important roles for cooperation between the Shelterin protein complex and telomerase in maintaining telomere length. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how aging-related stresses, such as deregulated protein homeostasis, impact telomere length. Here, we explored the possible roles of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs), key enzymes catalyzing the first reactions in protein synthesis, in regulating telomere length and aging. We selected seryl tRNA synthetase (SerRS) since our previous studies discovered expanded functions of SerRS in the nucleus in addition to its canonical cytoplasmic role in protein synthesis. In this study, we revealed that overexpression of SerRS promoted cellular senescence and inhibited the growth of cervical tumor xenografts in mice by triggering the senescence of tumor cells. In the nucleus, SerRS directly bound to telomeric DNA repeats and tethered more POT1 proteins to telomeres through a direct interaction between the UNE-S domain of SerRS and the OB1 domain of POT1. We further demonstrated that SerRS-induced enrichment of POT1 prevented the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres, resulting in progressive telomere shortening. Our data suggested a possible molecular link between protein synthesis and telomere length control, the deregulation of which may be associated with aging and cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Multiple linear regression adjusted for confounding factors found that iron intake was negatively associated with LTL only in women and negatively associated with mtDNAcn only in men. Moreover, iron intake was positively associated with TNF<i>α</i> in both women and men but positively associated with SOD only in men. Path modeling showed that TNF<i>α</i> significantly mediated the indirect detrimental effect of iron intake on LTL only in women; in men, mediation of the indirect effect of iron intake on mtDNAcn by TNF<i>α</i> did not reach significance.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Conclusions' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>The study found sex-specific negative associations between dietary iron intake and cellular aging markers in that iron intake had deleterious effects on LTL attrition in women and mtDNAcn in men; only the former was partly mediated by TNF<i>α</i>.

The accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in this effect. With rapid progress in cosmetic health and quality of life, use of safe and highly effective phytochemicals has become a need of the hour. Zerumbone (ZER), a natural sesquiterpene, from <i>Zingiber zerumbet</i> rhizomes is well-known for its beneficial effects. We investigated the antiphotoaging and dermatoprotective efficacies of ZER (2-8 <i>μ</i>M) against UVA irradiation (3 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms in human skin fibroblast (HSF) cells. ZER treatment prior to low dose of UVA exposure increased cell viability. UVA-induced ROS generation was remarkably suppressed by ZER with parallel inhibition of MMP-1 activation and collagen III degradation. This was due to the inhibition of AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun) translocation. Furthermore, ZER alleviated UVA-induced SA-<i>β</i>-galactosidase activity. Dose- or time-dependent increase of antioxidant genes, HO-1 and <i>γ</i>-GCLC by ZER, was associated with increased expression and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 as well as decreased cytosolic Keap-1 expressions. Altered luciferase activity of ARE could explain the significance of Nrf2/ARE pathway underlying the dermatoprotective properties of ZER. Pharmacological inhibition of various signaling pathways suppressed nuclear Nrf2 activation in HSF cells confirming that Nrf2 translocation was mediated by ERK, JNK, PI3K/AKT, PKC, AMPK, casein kinase II, and ROS signaling pathways. Moreover, increased basal ROS levels and Nrf2 translocation seem crucial in ZER-mediated Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. This was also evidenced from Nrf2 knocked-out studies in which ZER was not able to suppress the UVA-induced ROS generation in the absence of Nrf2. This study concluded that in the treatment of UVA-induced premature skin aging, ZER may consider as a desirable food supplement for skin protection and/or preparation of skin care products.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 You-Cheng Hseu et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is a hallmark of various diseases including metabolic syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and age-related diseases. Several mitochondrial defects have been considered to contribute to the development of oxidative stress and known as the major mediators of the aging process and subsequent age-associated diseases. Thus, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants should prevent or slow down these processes and prolong longevity. This is the reason why antioxidant treatments are extensively studied and newer and newer compounds with such an effect appear. Astaxanthin, a xanthophyll carotenoid, is the most abundant carotenoid in marine organisms and is one of the most powerful natural compounds with remarkable antioxidant activity.

Sedentary lifestyle in the elderly contributes to this condition; however, physical activity improves health, reducing morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown that metformin (MTF) can also prevent muscle damage promoting muscular performance. To date, there is great controversy if MTF treatment combined with exercise training improves or nullifies the benefits provided by physical activity. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of long-term moderate exercise combined with MTF treatment on body composition, strength, redox state, and survival rate during the life of female Wistar rats. In this study, rats performed moderate exercise during 20 of their 24 months of life and were treated with MTF for one year or for 6 months, i.e., from 12 to 24 months old and 18 to 24 months old. The body composition (percentage of fat, bone, and lean mass) was determined using a dual-energy X-ray absorption scanner (DXA), and grip strength was determined using a dynamometer. Likewise, medial and tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were evaluated and the redox state was measured by HPLC, calculating the GSH/GSSG ratio in the gastrocnemius muscle. Our results suggest- that the MTF administration, both in the sedentary and the exercise groups, might activate a mechanism that is directly related to the induction of the hormetic response through the redox state modulation. MTF treatment does not eliminate the beneficial effects of exercise throughout life, and although MTF does not increase muscle mass, it increases longevity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 David Hernández-Álvarez et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, to date, no effective therapy exists that targets the functional recovery after stroke. After necrosis, neuroinflammation is a common feature of the acute stroke and a major obstacle to tissue restoration. In the lesioned area, the dying neurons release chemotactic signals, such as fractalkine/CX3CL1, which evoke 'eat-me' signals that are recognized by microglia expressing complement C3a receptor (C3aR), resulting in phagocytosis of the dying but still viable neurons, known as secondary phagocytosis. Using a mouse model of stroke and two-photon microscopy, we aimed to attenuate poststroke phagocytosis of the dying but still viable neurons by using SB 290157, an antagonist of C3aR. We found that intracortical administration of SB 290157 reduced the number of inflammatory microglial cells expressing ED1 and Iba1 antigens at the lesion site. We could show, in vivo, that two days after a needle-induced cortical lesion there were less microglial cells present around the injury site, displaying less high-order branches and an increase in the lower order ones, suggesting an attenuated phagocytic phenotype in treated animals as compared with controls. We conclude that the C3aR antagonist, SB 290157, may be used in the future to limit the neuronal death by limiting secondary phagocytosis after stroke.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Roxana Surugiu et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the direct and indirect relationships. Sobel test was also used to test specific mediating effects of optimism and meaning in life.<b>Results</b>: Spirituality was positively related with positive affect and life satisfaction, but negatively related with negative affect. The SEM results revealed that the relationship between spirituality and subjective well-being was indirect. Sobel test showed that the mediating effect of optimism was only statistically significant for negative affect but not positive affect and life satisfaction. In contrast, the mediating effect of meaning in life was statistically significant for the three components of subjective well-being.<b>Conclusion</b>: The study has demonstrated that spirituality indirectly influences subjective well-being through optimism and meaning in life. It also showed the relative importance of meaning in life over optimism as a mediator. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings have been discussed.</AbstractText>"}

Despite this, such interventions are increasingly used. The aim of this review was to appraise the effectiveness and implementation readiness of psychosocial interventions for people with dementia in LMICs.<b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of databases from 1998-2019. Studies were rated on two scales assessing quality and implementation readiness.<b>Results:</b> Seventeen articles describing 11 interventions in six countries were evaluated. Interventions included Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), a Multidisciplinary Cognitive Rehabilitation Programme (MCRP), singing interventions, occupational therapy and reminiscence therapy. The quality of included studies was variable, and many had low sample sizes. Evidence for improving both cognition and quality of life was found in two interventions: Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) and a Multidisciplinary Cognitive Rehabilitation Programme (MCRP). Implementation issues were more likely to be explored in studies of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) than in any other intervention.<b>Conclusions:</b> Of the included studies here, CST appears to be the most implementation ready, improving both cognition and quality of life with implementation readiness effectively explored in two LMIC countries: India and Tanzania.</AbstractText>"}

Previous qualitative research on a group intervention that focuses on memory changes in older adulthood revealed that one of the greatest benefits derived by participants was the realization that their experience with memory changes was normal. In order to quantify this experience, we developed and validated a new measure, the 26-item <i>Subjective Normalcy Inventory</i> (SNI).<b>Method:</b> Reliability and validity were assessed with a sample of 167 community-dwelling adults between the ages of 55 and 90. Questionnaire responsiveness was assessed with an additional sample of 29 older adults who completed a 5-session memory intervention program known to cultivate normalization.<b>Results:</b> The SNI exhibited a two-factor structure, excellent test-retest reliability, ICC = .79, excellent internal consistency, Cronbach's α = .91, and good convergent, |<i>rs|</i> = .46-.58, and discriminant, <i>rs</i> = .02-.06, validity. The measure was also responsive to change, as participants who completed the memory intervention program reported a greater sense of normalcy relative to nonintervention controls, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.17.<b>Conclusion:</b> The SNI has the potential to provide novel and useful outcome information for interventions designed to improve one's sense of normalcy and may be applied in both clinical and research settings. The SNI can also be modified, validated, and used to assess subjective normalcy with respect to other personal challenges outside of memory and attention changes.</AbstractText>"}

We aimed to (1) determine the reference values of LVLAVR, (2) investigate their age and gender dependency, and (3) clarify which anthropometric and echocardiography parameters are closely associated with these indices. Both left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) volume curves were obtained using 3DE speckle tracking analytical software, and the LVLAVR curve throughout one cardiac cycle was created, from which LVLAVR at ventricular end-diastole and at ventricular end-systole were determined in 313 healthy subjects (age, 20-85 years; 51% men). The mean values of LVLAVR at ventricular end-diastole and ventricular end-systole in male subjects were 5.74 ± 1.54 and 1.37 ± 0.35, respectively. Corresponding values in female subjects were significantly lower (5.20 ± 1.47, p = .003 and 1.13 ± 0.29, p &lt; .001) than the values in male subjects. LVLAVR at ventricular end-diastole step wisely decreased to advanced aging, and had a highest F ratio compared with other left chamber volumetric parameters in both genders. LV mass and LA ejection fraction were significantly associated with LVLAVR at ventricular end-diastole. In contrast, LV mass and LV ejection fraction were significantly coupled with LVLAVR at ventricular end-systole. This study provides the reference values for LVLAVR from a relatively large number of healthy subjects. LVLAVR may be a sensitive parameter to reflect age- and gender-related change in LV and LA volumes. Further studies should be required to determine its clinical usefulness over traditional echocardiography parameters in various cardiovascular diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we demonstrate that a human-origin Lactobacillus paracasei D3-5 strain (D3-5), even in the non-viable form, extends life span of Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, feeding of heat-killed D3-5 to old mice (&gt; 79 weeks) prevents high- fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunctions, decreases leaky gut and inflammation, and improves physical and cognitive functions. D3-5 feeding significantly increases mucin production, and proportionately, the abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila also increases. Mechanistically, we show that the lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component of D3-5, enhances mucin (Muc2) expression by modulating TLR-2/p38-MAPK/NF-kB pathway, which in turn reduces age-related leaky gut and inflammation.

The cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are continuously exposed to new proteins and in situations of aberrant protein folding, one of three lines of defence may be activated: (i) heat shock response; (ii) mitochondrial UPR; and (iii) endoplasmic reticulum UPR. These pathways lead to different signal transduction mechanisms that activate or upregulate transcription factors that, in turn, regulate genes that increase the cell's ability to correct the conformation of poorly folded proteins or, ultimately, lead to apoptosis. Despite the recent progress in understanding such biological processes, few studies have focused on the implications of the UPR in male infertility, highlighting the need for a first approach concerning the presence of these components in the male reproductive system. In testis there is a high rate of protein synthesis and the UPR mechanisms are well described. However, the presence of these mechanisms in spermatozoa, apparently transcriptionally inactive cells, is contentious, and it is unclear how sperm cells deal with stress. Here, we review current concepts and mechanisms of the UPR and highlight the relevance of these stress response pathways in male fertility, especially the presence and functional activation of those components in male germinal cells and spermatozoa.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In the past 30 years, the absolute numbers of deaths and people with disabilities owing to neurological diseases have risen substantially, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and further increases are expected globally as a result of population growth and ageing. This rise in absolute numbers of people affected suggests that advances in prevention and management of major neurological disorders are not sufficiently effective to counter global demographic changes. Urgent measures to reduce this burden are therefore needed.

The results showed that with this process the response of the sensor to SO<sub>2</sub> performed an opposite direction to that in the sensor's initial state. The reason might be that the PtS produced at the Pt electrode increased the electrochemical catalytic activity of the Pt electrode, leading to the mixed potential of the Pt electrode higher than that of the ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrode.

We have previously shown that probiotics counteract AD progression in 3xTg-AD mice modifying gut microbiota and inducing energy metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis. Ameliorated cognition is based on higher neuroprotective gut hormones concentrations, reduced amyloid-β burden, and restored proteolytic pathways. Here, we demonstrate that probiotics oral administration improves glucose uptake in 3xTg-AD mice by restoring the brain expression levels of key glucose transporters (GLUT3, GLUT1) and insulin-like growth factor receptor β, in accordance with the diminished phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and protein-kinase B (Akt). In parallel, phosphorylated tau aggregates decrease in treated mice. Probiotics counteract the time-dependent increase of glycated hemoglobin and the accumulation of advanced glycation end products in AD mice, consistently with memory improvement. Collectively, our data elucidate the mechanism through which gut microbiota manipulation ameliorates impaired glucose metabolism in AD, finally delaying the disease progression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Next, we examined associations between CBF, white matter lesion (WML) volume, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and cortical thickness to better understand whether altered CBF was detectable before other markers and the potential mechanistic underpinnings of CBF deficits in MCI. MCI had significantly reduced CBF, whereas cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation were not affected. Reduced CBF was associated with the WML volume but not associated with other measures. Given the presumed vascular etiology of WML and relative worsening of vascular health in MCI, it may suggest CBF deficits result from early vascular as opposed to metabolic deficits in MCI.

Hospitalization data from 2014-2015 was obtained on all adults receiving HIV care at 14 diverse sites within the HIV Research Network in the United States. Modified clinical classification software from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality assigned primary ICD-9 codes into diagnostic categories. Analysis performed with multivariate negative binomial regression. Among 20,608 subjects during 2014-2015, all cause hospitalization rate was 201/1000PY. Non-AIDS defining infection (non-ADI) was the leading cause for admission (44.2/1000PY), followed by cardiovascular disease (CVD) (21.2/1000PY). In multivariate analysis of all-cause admissions, the incidence rate ratio (aIRR) increased with older age (age 18-29 reference): age 30-39 aIRR 1.09 (0.90,1.32), age 40-49 1.38 (1.16,1.63), age 50-59 1.58 (1.33,1.87), and age ≥ 60 2.14 (1.77,2.59). Hospitalization rates increased significantly with age for CVD, endocrine, renal, pulmonary, and oncology. All cause hospitalization rates increased with older age, especially among non-communicable diseases (NCDs), while non-ADIs remained the leading cause for hospitalization. HIV providers should be comfortable screening for and treating NCDs.</AbstractText>"}

Aging and injury are triggers of joint pathological changes mediated by pro-inflammatory factors, some of which are secreted by white adipose tissue. Adipokines including adiponectin, leptin, resistin, chemerin, IL-6, and TNF-α are major players not only during inflammation but also in metabolic regulation of joint cells including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts as well as mesenchymal stem cells. The purpose of this review is to summarize the signal transduction pathways of adipokines in the articular joint to provide new information on potential targets for intervention of OA.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RECENT FINDINGS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>The risk of knee osteoarthritis is associated with adipokine gene polymorphism. While the infrapatellar fat pad is a major source of adipokines in knee synovial fluid, adipocytes also accumulate in the bone marrow during aging and obesity. Adipokines can act as SASPs (senescence associated secretory phenotype factors) that participate in cellular senescence of chondrocytes, but they also regulate energy metabolism impacting bone remodeling. Thus, adipokines are closely related to the metabolic syndrome and degenerative pathological changes in cartilage and bone during OA. Modulating the effects of adipokines on different cell types in the intra-articular joint will be a promising new option for OA intervention.</AbstractText>"}

Vitamins (A, C, E and carotenoids) modify skeletal muscle via protein and collagen synthesis and anti-inflammatory activities. Previous studies have not investigated intake of these vitamins in relation to sarcopenic indices in both younger and older-aged women. Indices of skeletal muscle mass (as fat-free mass (FFM) relative to body size) were measured using DXA and leg explosive power (LEP) using the Nottingham Power Rig in 2570 women aged 18-79 years. Adjusted measures of skeletal muscle were calculated according to quintiles of vitamin C, E, retinol and carotenoid intake, derived from Food Frequency Questionnaires, after stratification by age. Higher vitamin C intake was associated with significantly higher indices of FFM and LEP, (Q5-Q1 = 2.0-12.8%, P &lt; 0.01-0.02). Intakes of total and individual carotenoids were significantly associated with indices of FFM and LEP (Q5-Q1 = 1.0-7.5%). Vitamin E was significantly associated with FFM% and FFM<sub>BMI</sub> only. In mutually adjusted analysis with vitamin C, total carotene, vitamin E and protein in the model, the strongest associations were with vitamin C. These associations were stronger in younger women (&lt; 65 years). For the first time, our research shows higher dietary intakes of antioxidant vitamins, particularly vitamin C, is associated with higher skeletal muscle mass and power in free-living women. These findings have relevance for the treatment and prevention of frailty and sarcopenia throughout adulthood.</AbstractText>"}

The objective of this study was to test the association between microglial expression of soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (sTREM2), as a measure of neuroinflammation, and brain atrophy in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Brain magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTREM2, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated181 tau (p-tau), and Aβ42 were analyzed in 115 cognitively unimpaired older adults, classified according to the A/T/(N)-framework. MRIs were repeated after 2 (n = 95) and 4 (n = 62) years. High baseline sTREM2 was associated with accelerated cortical thinning in the temporal cortex of the left hemisphere, as well as bilateral hippocampal atrophy, independently of age, Aβ42, and tau. sTREM2-related atrophy only marginally increased with biomarker positivity across the AD continuum (A-T- #x2292; A+T- #x2292; A+T+) but was significantly stronger in participants with a high level of p-tau (T+). sTREM2-related cortical thinning correlated significantly with areas of high microglial-specific gene expression in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. In conclusion, increased CSF sTREM2 was associated with accelerated cortical and hippocampal atrophy in cognitively unimpaired older participants, particularly in individuals with tau pathology.

CSCs may hijack the host immune surveillance resulting in typically aggressive tumors with poor prognosis.In this review, we focus on neurotrophic control of cellular substrates and molecular mechanisms involved in CSC-driven tumor growth as well as in host immune surveillance. Neurotrophins have been demonstrated to be key tumor promoting signaling platforms. Particularly, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and its specific receptor Tropomyosin related kinase A (TrkA) have been implicated in initiation and progression of many aggressive cancers. On the other hand, an active NGF pathway has been recently proven to be critical to oncogenic inflammation control and in promoting immune response against cancer, pinpointing possible pro-tumoral effects of NGF/TrkA-inhibitory therapy.A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of tumor growth/immunoediting is essential to identify new predictive and prognostic intervention and to design more effective therapies. Fine and timely modulation of CSCs-driven tumor growth and of peripheral lymph nodes activation by the immune system will possibly open the way to precision medicine in neurotrophic therapy and improve patient's prognosis in both TrkA- dependent and independent cancers.</AbstractText>"}

Tangible characteristics of early hearing loss (HL) are defined in correlation with nascent hidden hearing loss (HHL) in humans and animal models. Despite the plethora of causes of HL, only two prevailing mechanisms for HHL have been identified, and in both cases, common structural deficits are implicated in inner hair cell synapses, and demyelination of the auditory nerve (AN). We uncovered that Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>Na</sub>) mRNA and channel proteins are distinctly and locally expressed in dendritic projections of primary ANs and genetic deletion of K<sub>Na</sub> channels (<i>Kcnt1</i> and <i>Kcnt2</i>) results in the loss of proper AN synaptic function, characterized as HHL, without structural synaptic alterations. We further demonstrate that the local functional synaptic alterations transition from HHL to increased hearing-threshold, which entails changes in global Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, activation of caspases 3/9, impaired regulation of inositol triphosphate receptor 1 (IP<sub>3</sub>R1), and apoptosis-mediated neurodegeneration. Thus, the present study demonstrates how local synaptic dysfunction results in an apparent latent pathological phenotype (HHL) and, if undetected, can lead to overt HL. It also highlights, for the first time, that HHL can precede structural synaptic dysfunction and AN demyelination. The stepwise cellular mechanisms from HHL to canonical HL are revealed, providing a platform for intervention to prevent lasting and irreversible age-related hearing loss (ARHL).</AbstractText>"}

Decline in cell vitality then occurred, yet slowly, uncoordinatedly when comparing pairs of daughters, and independently of the cell death mediator Mca1/Yca1. Furthermore, we showed that senescence can be modulated by ploidy, suggesting that gross chromosome imbalances during segregation may account for this phenotype.

The results obtained verify the toxic potential of the NPs toward D. magna even in sublethal concentrations, with a more pronounced effect being observed for η-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs. The toxicity is associated with an increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and deregulation of antioxidant enzymatic/non-enzymatic enzymes (CAT, SOD and GSH).

The sample (N = 170) included older Caucasian men with hip fracture that were propensity score matched (1:1) to community-dwelling non-fractured comparators. Hip Structural Analysis (HSA) calculated aerial BMD and metrics of bone structural strength: cross-sectional bone area (CSA), cortical outer diameter (OD), section modulus (SM), and centroid position (CP). Mixed-effect models estimated changes in HSA parameters and adjusted robust regression models evaluated between-cohort differences in annual percent change at the narrow neck (NN), intertrochanteric (IT), and femoral shaft (FS). Hip fracture was associated with statistically greater declines in NN CSA (β = -2.818; 95% CI: -3.300%, -2.336%), SM (β = -1.896%; 95% CI: -2.711%, -1.080%) and CP (β = -0.884%; 95% CI: -0.889%, -0.880%) and significantly larger increases in NN OD (β = 0.187%; 95% CI: 0.185%, 0.190%).

The different mechanisms and signaling pathways that change with age and contribute to the development of osteoporosis are being identified. One key upstream mechanism that appears to target a number of osteogenic pathways with age is kynurenine, a tryptophan metabolite and an endogenous Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist. The AhR signaling pathway has been reported to promote aging phenotypes across species and in different tissues. We previously found that kynurenine accumulates with age in the plasma and various tissues including bone and induces bone loss and osteoporosis in mice. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are responsible for osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and overall bone regeneration. In the present study, we investigated the effect of kynurenine on BMSCs, with a focus on autophagy and senescence as two cellular processes that control BMSCs proliferation and differentiation capacity. We found that physiological levels of kynurenine (10 and 100 μM) disrupted autophagic flux as evidenced by the reduction of LC3B-II, and autophagolysosomal production, as well as a significant increase of p62 protein level. Additionally, kynurenine also induced a senescent phenotype in BMSCs as shown by the increased expression of several senescence markers including senescence associated β-galactosidase in BMSCs. Additionally, western blotting reveals that levels of p21, another marker of senescence, also increased in kynurenine-treated BMSCs, while senescent-associated aggregation of nuclear H3K9me3 also showed a significant increase in response to kynurenine treatment. To validate that these effects are in fact due to AhR signaling pathway, we utilized two known AhR antagonists: CH-223191, and 3',4'-dimethoxyflavone to try to block AhR signaling and rescue kynurenine /AhR mediated effects. Indeed, AhR inhibition restored kynurenine-suppressed autophagy levels as shown by levels of LC3B-II, p62 and autophagolysosomal formation demonstrating a rescuing of autophagic flux. Furthermore, inhibition of AhR signaling prevented the kynurenine-induced increase in senescence associated β-galactosidase and p21 levels, as well as blocking aggregation of nuclear H3K9me3. Taken together, our results suggest that kynurenine inhibits autophagy and induces senescence in BMSCs via AhR signaling, and that this may be a novel target to prevent or reduce age-associated bone loss and osteoporosis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Along the years, I-NHS has developed a structural public-private partnership in health services delivery that in some regions contributes to the achievement of very high standards of healthcare quality. However, the I-NHS is currently facing some major challenges: (a) Italy is experiencing a remarkable aging of its population with increasing health needs; (b) the recent and constant cuts to public expenditures are reducing the budget for welfare. It is of utmost importance to ensure that on-going efforts to contain health system costs do not subsume health care quality. In addition, monitoring of the essential levels of care (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza, LEA) highlights significant differences in healthcare delivery among Italian regions that, in turns, contribute to the burdensome migration of patients to best-performing regions.

The former deficit is a direct consequence of reduced muscle mass while the latter has been attributed to a depression of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. It is well established that age-onset reductions in sex hormone production regulate the atrophic component in both males and females. However, it is unknown whether the non-atrophic component is influenced by sex hormones. Since the non-atrophic component has been linked mechanistically to reduced expression of the skeletal muscle L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1), we recorded L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, gating charge movements and depolarization-induced changes in myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers of naïve and gonadectomized mice of both sexes. Our first set of experiments sought to identify any basal differences in EC coupling or L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux between the sexes; no detectable differences in any of the aforementioned parameters were observed between FDB harvested from either naïve males or females. In the latter segments of the study, ovariectomy (OVX) and orchiectomy (ORX) models were used to assess the possible influence of sex hormones on EC coupling and/or L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. In these experiments, FDB fibers harvested from OVX and ORX mice both showed no differences in L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, gating charge movement or depolarization-induced changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, our results indicate L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function and EC coupling are: 1) equivalent between the sexes, and 2) not significantly regulated by sex hormones. Since recent NIH review guidelines mandate the consideration of sex differences as a criterion for review, our work indicates the suitability of either sex for the study of the fundamental mechanisms of EC coupling. Thus, our findings may accelerate the research process by conserving animals, labor and financial resources.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

They are known to accumulate with age in mice, monkeys and man, and are suspected to drive the development and progression of neoplasia. Eyes develop age-associated changes, most commonly in the retina, cornea and lens. The aim of this study was to test whether senescent cells increase with age in the canine eye in general and in the microenvironment of ocular tumours in particular. The senescence markers γH2AX and p21 were tested in young (n = 10, age ≤2 years) versus old (n = 9, age range 9.5-12.4 years) canine eyes, as well as in the microenvironment of intraocular tumours, namely uveal melanocytomas (n = 13) and ciliary body adenomas (n = 9). To consider a potential association of senescence with biological behaviour, we compared the expression of both markers in tumour cells of benign uveal melanocytomas (n = 13) versus malignant conjunctival melanomas (n = 7). Canine eyes showed no age-dependent changes in senescent cells. However, a significant increase of the percentage of γH2AX- or p21-labelled cells was found in the retina, uvea and lens of tumour-bearing eyes. Tumour cells in conjunctival melanomas had a significantly increased percentage of p21-expressing cells compared with uveal melanocytomas. We conclude, that senescent cells do not accumulate with age in otherwise normal canine eyes and that a senescent microenvironment of intraocular tumours is unlikely to be age driven. In addition, as in man, the percentage of p21-positive cells was increased in melanomas, supporting the theory that malignant tumours may override the senescence-associated cell cycle arrest.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, to our knowledge, no study has focused on the role of local governments for realizing healthy ageing. This study examined the association between the intensity of community-based programs for frailty postponement by long-term care insurers (as municipalities) and the likelihood of frailty. We analyzed repeated cross-sectional data of three waves (2010-11, 2013, and 2016) from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES). Participants included 375,400 older adults aged 65 years or older (M = 74.1) living in a total of 81 regions covered by insurers in Japan. Frailty was assessed by a governmental standardized index, the Kihon Check List (KCL; a basic function check list in Japanese). Estimations were obtained using a multilevel logistic model with random slopes. We found that every social activity per hundred older people organized by a long-term care insurer was significantly associated with an 11% reduction of the likelihood of frailty (Odds ratio = 0.89; 95% credible interval = 0.81, 0.99). Although the main effect of educational events was not significant, the point estimate was slightly larger for people with lower levels of education than for those with higher education. The results also suggested that insurer-organized social activities could be more beneficial in communities with few opportunities for civic participation.

Previous studies have suggested that blue light (BL) could induce retinal degeneration, which is a major cause of the onset and development of severe AMD. In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, A2E, a lipofuscin fluorophore, is accumulated with aging. When A2E is exposed to BL, it is easily oxidized to A2E-epoxides, leading to oxidative stress and inflammatory response in retina. The aim of this study was to investigate protective effect of Prunella vulagris (P.V) extract against oxidative stress and inflammation caused by BL, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in the cultured RPE cells and balb-c mice. In both model studies, P.V extract activated NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2)/hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, followed by inhibition of ROS/MDA production, GSH depletion and reduction in SOD activity. Furthermore, P.V extract inhibited upregulation of inflammatory related genes (interlukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A)) and BL induced RPE cell death, determined by cell viability and histological analyses. The mechanism of protection against inflammation by P.V extract involves inhibition of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) along with degradation of NF-kB inhibitor alpha (IkB alpha). The results suggest that P.V extract could be a potential intervention to prevent the onset and development of severe AMD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Aged Wistar male rats (23month old) were intragastrically treated with 4-PSQ (5mg/kg) for seven days. On the 14th day of the experimental protocol, plasma was collected to determine selenium levels and biochemical markers of renal and hepatic damage. Furthermore, liver, kidney, spleen and cerebral cortex were removed to determine thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), non-protein thiols (NPSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D). Our results showed that one or more parameters changed markedly in the liver, kidney, spleen and cerebral cortex of aged rats.

Treatment with 4-PSQ repaired redox homeostasis in tissues of aged rats, as well as plasma biochemical markers of renal and hepatic damage and selenium levels. In conclusion, 4-PSQ presented an antioxidant effect in tissues of aged rats, restoring selenium levels, and contributing to the restoration of the damage caused by aging.

The pro-senescent potential of SMVs from middle-aged rats (M-SMVs) was analyzed by comparison with young (Y, 12-week) and old (O) rats.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>The shedding of SMVs significantly increased with age and was inhibited by EPA:DHA 6:1 intake that also prevented ROS accumulation in spleen. Incubation of ECs with 10 nM SMVs from middle-aged and old but not those from young rats induced premature senescence after 48 h. The pro-senescent effect of M-SMVs was prevented by Losartan and associated with endothelial oxidative stress. M-SMVs induced an up-regulation of senescence markers (p16, p21, p53), pro-atherothrombotic (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, tissue factor) and pro-inflammatory markers (pNF-κB, COX-2) and proteins of the angiotensin system (ACE, AT1-R). Conversely, endothelial NO synthase was down-regulated. Intake of EPA:DHA 1:1 and 6:1 by middle-aged rats decreased SMV shedding by 14% and 24%, respectively. Only EPA:DHA 6:1 intake abolished the M-SMVs-induced endothelial senescence and reduced the pro-senescent action of O-SMVs by 45%. Protection of ECs was not observed in response to SMVs from EPA:DHA 1:1 treated rats.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Ingestion of EPA:DHA 6:1 by middle-aged or old rats, respectively abolished or limited both the shedding of SMVs and their pro-senescent, pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory effects in ECs, most likely by triggering the local angiotensin system. EPA:DHA 6:1 may help to delay ageing-related endothelial dysfunction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This transition happens due to changes in ovarian follicular activity, leading to endocrine, biological and clinical modifications. The main hormones related to these changes and symptoms are oestradiol, LH, FSH, AMH, Inhibin B and GnRH. It is important to point out that the skin is very affected by all these hormone changes, leading to a decrease in collagen content, water content, elasticity, thickness and impacting on all skin layers quality. Aiming to help women go through this period of their lifetimes with a better quality of life, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries have studied formulations to improve skin quality. In order to study the safety and efficacy of these products, in vitro methods have been developed in order to mimic menopause and aged skin. In addition to that, many clinical methodologies for skin features assessment have also been improved and applied to evaluate the efficacy of treatments or compounds for menopause. Studying and improving skin models and skin evaluation methodologies may help in the identification of therapeutic targets, treatments, drugs and cosmetics along with new insights for future research in the dermatology field.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Neuroinflammation likely contributes to the disruption of the BBB in CSVD. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of how neuroinflammation causes BBB damage is essential to preventing BBB disruption in CSVD. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) contributes to BBB damage in neuroinflammatory diseases. In this study, we observed that interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced MMP-9 secretion in pericytes increased BBB permeability to sodium fluorescein (Na-F) by damaging the disruption of VE-cadherin, occludin, claudin-5, and zonula occludin-1 (ZO-1). Melatonin reduced BBB permeability to Na-F and inhibited the disruption of the adherens and tight junction proteins. Melatonin also downregulated <i>MMP-9</i> and upregulated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (<i>TIMP-1</i>) gene expression, which decreased the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. In addition, nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65 induced by IL-1β in pericytes upregulated MMP-9 expression, which was inhibited by the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC. However, the NOTCH3 inhibitor DAPT significantly inhibited NF-κB/p65 translocation to the nucleus, while melatonin in combination with DAPT significantly prevented NF-κB/p65 translocation than DAPT alone. Our results suggest that melatonin reduced MMP-9-induced permeability of the BBB. Melatonin reduced MMP-9 expression and activity, which was induced by IL-1β through the regulation of the NOTCH3/NF-κB signaling pathway in pericytes, suggesting that pericytes regulate BBB integrity and function.</AbstractText>"}

We tried to develop a prognostic prediction model for NSCLC patients based on the expression profiles of autophagy-associated genes. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine autophagy-associated genes significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) of the TCGA lung cancer cohort. LASSO regression was performed to build multiple-gene prognostic signatures. We found that the 22-gene and 11-gene signatures could dichotomize patients with significantly different OS and independently predict the OS in TCGA lung adenocarcinoma (HR=2.801, 95% CI=2.252-3.486, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and squamous cell carcinoma (HR=1.105, 95% CI=1.067-1.145, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), respectively. The prognostic performance of the 22-gene signature was validated in four GEO lung cancer cohorts. Moreover, GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses unveiled several fundamental signaling pathways and cellular processes associated with the 22-gene signature in lung adenocarcinoma. We also constructed a clinical nomogram with a concordance index of 0.71 to predict the survival possibility of NSCLC patients by integrating clinical characteristics and the autophagy gene signature. The calibration curves substantiated fine concordance between nomogram prediction and actual observation. Overall, we constructed and verified a novel autophagy-associated gene signature that could improve the individualized outcome prediction in NSCLC.</AbstractText>"}

Central theories explaining the maintenance of such behavioural variation posits that individuals expressing greater 'risky' behaviours should suffer higher mortality. Here, for the first time, we synthesize the existing empirical evidence for this key prediction. Our results did not support this prediction as there was no directional relationship between riskier behaviour and greater mortality; however there was a significant absolute relationship between behaviour and survival. In total, behaviour explained a significant, but small, portion (5.8%) of the variance in survival. We also found that risky (vs. 'shy') behavioural types live significantly longer in the wild, but not in the laboratory. This suggests that individuals expressing risky behaviours might be of overall higher quality but the lack of predation pressure and resource restrictions mask this effect in laboratory environments. Our work demonstrates that individual differences in behaviour explain important differences in survival but not in the direction predicted by theory. Importantly, this suggests that models predicting behaviour to be a mediator of reproduction-survival trade-offs may need revision and/or empiricists may need to reconsider their proxies of risky behaviours when testing such theory.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd/CNRS.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We examined the biological effects of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) on mitochondrial biogenesis, melanogenesis, and connective tissue proteins in vitro. In a radical scavenging assay, PDRN showed antioxidant activities in a dose-dependent manner, and those activities can suppress cellular oxidative stress in skin cells. PDRN directly inhibited mushroom tyrosinase activity and cellular tyrosinase activity, thus significantly reducing the cellular melanin content in B16-F10 melanocytes. The mRNA and protein expressions of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which is a key melanogenic gene transcription factor, were significantly downregulated by PDRN. Accordingly, tyrosinase-related protein 1, dopachrome tautomerase, and tyrosinase, which gene expressions were regulated by MITF, were significantly downregulated by PDRN. Mitotracker-probed mitochondria image analysis suggested that PDRN enhanced mitochondrial density in both murine melanoma cells and in human skin fibroblast cells. In addition, PDRN strongly suppressed in vitro elastase enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-1 gene expression in human skin fibroblast cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that PDRN has multiple beneficial biological activities in skin cells: hypopigmentation, induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, and the inhibition of collective tissue proteins.</AbstractText>"}

Epigenetics, which include mechanisms regulating gene expression independently of changes to DNA sequence, regulate gene expression by modulating the structure of chromatin or by regulating the binding of transcriptional machinery to DNA. Several studies showed that an impairment of epigenetic mechanisms promotes alteration of gene expression underlying several aging-related diseases. Alteration of these mechanisms is also linked with changes of gene expression that occurs during aging processes of different tissues. In this review, we will outline the potential role of epigenetics in the onset of two age-related pathologies, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.</AbstractText>"}

To further establish whether our data correlated with gene expression alterations associated with aging and senescence, we compared our global transcriptional data with additional published datasets, including alterations in gene expression in the neocortex and cerebellum of old mice, human frontal cortex after age of 40, gene alterations in the Werner syndrome, rodent caloric restriction, Ras and oncogene-induced senescence in fibroblasts, and to tissues besides the brain such as the muscle and kidney. The most significant and enriched pathways associated with aging and senescence were positively correlated with alterations in gene expression in glutamate-injured neurons and, conversely, negatively correlated when the injured neurons were treated with candesartan.

Active brown/beige fat increases the energy expenditure and is associated with reduced hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, whereas its atrophy and inactivation have been associated with obesity and aging. Autophagy, which is the process by which intracellular components are degraded within the lysosomes, has recently emerged as an important regulatory mechanism of brown/beige fat plasticity. Studies have shown that autophagy participates in the intracellular remodeling events that occur during brown/beige adipogenesis, thermogenic activation, and inactivation. The autophagic degradation of mitochondria appears to be important for the inactivation of brown fat and the transition from beige-to-white adipose tissue. Moreover, autophagic dysregulation in adipose tissues has been associated with obesity.

Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes. These DNA methylation marks, their interaction with genetic variants and their impact on gene expression offer new insights into the relationship between epigenetic variation and brain structure and may provide the basis for biomarker discovery in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Although additional experiments are required to verify this hypothesis, coenzyme Q and its analogues known as electron carriers of bioenergetic chains may be universal cofactors of ATP synthases, stabilizing c-ring and prevent ion leakage through it.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we report for the first time the crystal structures of an antibody Fab that contains isoAsp in the complementarity-determining region (CDR), along with biochemical studies to detect isoAsp. By comparing the elution profiles of cation-exchange chromatography, it was clarified that the antibody 64M-5 Fab is converted from the normal form to isoAsp form spontaneously and time-dependently under physiological conditions. The isoAsp residue was identified with tryptic peptide mapping, N-terminal sequencing, and the protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase assay. Based on the fluorescence quenching method, the isoAsp form of 64M-5 Fab shows a one order of magnitude lower binding constant for its dinucleotide ligand dT(6-4)T than the normal form. According to the structure of the isoAsp form, the conformation of CDR L1 is changed from the normal form to isoAsp form; the loss of hydrogen bonds involving the Asn28L side-chain, and structural conversion of the β-turn from type I to type II'. The formation of isoAsp leads to a large displacement of the side chain of His27dL, and decreased electrostatic interactions with the phosphate group of dT(6-4)T. Such structural changes should be responsible for the lower affinity of the isoAsp form for dT(6-4)T than the normal form. These findings may provide insight into neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and related diseases caused by misfolded proteins.</AbstractText>"}

This has resulted in increasing exposure to age-related chronic illness that may be exacerbated by HIV/AIDS or antiretroviral treatment. Prior work has suggested that PLWHA may be subject to accelerated aging, with earlier onset and higher risk of acquiring many chronic illnesses. However, the magnitude of these effects, controlling for chronic co-morbidities, has not been fully quantified. We evaluate the magnitude of association of HIV infection on developing chronic conditions while controlling for demographics, behavioral risk factors, and chronic comorbidities. We compare chronic disease risks of diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancers, lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive impairment between PLWHA and HIV- individuals in a large, de-identified private insurance claims dataset (~24,000 PLWHA) using logistic regressions. HIV status is statistically significantly associated with higher levels for all chronic illnesses examined, a result which is robust to multiple model specifications and duration of analysis (2, 5, and 10 years from enrollment). Our results suggest that PLWHA may be at elevated risk for a wide variety of chronic illnesses and may require additional care as the aging PLWHA population grows.</AbstractText>"}

Relaxin, an insulin-like hormone, suppresses atrial fibrillation, inflammation and fibrosis in aged rats but the mechanisms-of-action are unknown. Here we show that relaxin treatment of aged rats reverses pathological electrical remodeling (increasing Nav1.5 expression and localization of Connexin43 to intercalated disks) by activating canonical Wnt signaling. In isolated adult ventricular myocytes, relaxin upregulated Nav1.5 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.3 nM) by a mechanism inhibited by the addition of Dickkopf-1. Furthermore, relaxin increased the levels of connexin43, Wnt1, and cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin. Treatment with Wnt1 or CHIR-99021 (a GSK3β inhibitor) mimicked the relaxin effects. In isolated fibroblasts, relaxin blocked TGFβ-induced collagen elevation in a Wnt dependent manner. These findings demonstrate a close interplay between relaxin and Wnt-signaling resulting in myocardial remodeling and reveals a fundamental mechanism of great therapeutic potential.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we show that depletion of CSB, a protein mutated in progeroid Cockayne syndrome (CS), is the earliest known trigger of p21-dependent replicative senescence. CSB depletion promotes overexpression of the HTRA3 protease resulting in mitochondrial impairments, which are causally linked to CS pathological phenotypes. The CSB promoter is downregulated by histone H3 hypoacetylation during DNA damage-response. Mechanistically, CSB binds to the p21 promoter thereby downregulating its transcription and blocking replicative senescence in a p53-independent manner. This activity of CSB is independent of its role in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. HTRA3 accumulation and senescence are partially rescued upon reduction of oxidative/nitrosative stress. These findings establish a CSB/p21 axis that acts as a barrier to replicative senescence, and link a progeroid factor with the process of regular ageing in human.</AbstractText>"}

Here we report that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) drives tumor growth and drug resistance by up regulating transcription factor Nrf2. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and xenografts, MKP-1 knockdown triggered the down-regulation of the metabolic enzymes and cytoprotective proteins, which are the target genes of Nrf2. Consequently, the cell growth was markedly inhibited with decrease of tumor metabolisms and GSH contents. Moreover, MKP-1 silencing sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, MKP-1 inhibited the ubiquitylation of Nrf2 via a direct interaction with the transcription factor. Nrf2 was hence stabilized and its transcriptional program was activated. Notably, Nrf2 elevated MKP-1 expression at transcriptional level. In human lung adenoma tumor samples, high levels of expression of MKP-1, Nrf2, and its target gene heme oxygenase 1 were closely correlated. Thus, MKP-1 and Nrf2 form a forward feedback loop in lung cancer cells, which stabilizing and activating Nrf2 to promote anabolic metabolism and GSH biosynthesis.

The study included 1126 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 440 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 610 patients with Parkinson's disease. In all cohorts, we genotyped ATXN1 and ATXN2 CAG repeats. In addition, in the FTD cohort, we determined the number of HTT CAG repeats. The frequency of HTT IAs was higher in patients with FTD (6.9%) versus controls (2.9%) and in the C9orf72 expansion noncarriers (7.2%) versus controls (2.9%), although the difference was nonsignificant after correction for multiple testing. Compared with controls, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) groups showed a significantly higher frequency of HTT IAs (13.6% vs. 2.9% controls). For the ATXN2 gene, we observed an increase in IA frequency in AD cases (AD 4.1% vs. controls 1.8%) and in the behavioral FTD group (4.8% vs. 1.8%). For the ATXN1 gene, we found a significant increase of IAs in patients with PNFA (18.6%) versus controls (6.7%). In conclusion, our work suggests that the HTT and ATXN1 IAS may contribute to PNFA pathogenesis and point to a link between ATXN2 IAS and AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As such, understanding the molecular basis for diversity requires identifying genes with both high and low population expression variance and identifying the mechanisms underlying their expression control.

In rural areas, the mobility of people is based on owning a private car, due to the lack of public transport. Furthermore, planning in rural municipalities is highly car oriented. Small municipalities with shrinking and aging populations have many challenges to ensure access to services for their residents. This paper focuses on a case study of a small municipality with less than 2000 inhabitants. The objective of the study was to enhance sustainable change in shrinking rural areas and maintain them as good places to live even in the future. Access to local services and social activities is a major challenge for older people, who no longer have the possibility to use their own car. The problem with relocation is the lack of suitable apartments for older people. A dense and walkable municipal centre with accessible apartments may help municipalities provide for their older populations. Moreover, in Finland, second homeowners are an important resource for small municipalities. Spaces for social intercourse between residents and between permanent residents and second homeowners may enhance vitality and community building in these municipalities.</AbstractText>"}

It is responsible for the disposal and recycling of metabolic macromolecules and damaged organelles through broad lysosomal degradation processes. Under stress conditions, including nutrient deficiency, autophagy is substantially activated to maintain proper cell function and promote cell survival. Altered autophagy processes have been reported in various aging studies, and a dysregulated autophagy is associated with various age-associated diseases. Calorie restriction (CR) is regarded as the gold standard for many aging intervention methods. Although it is clear that CR has diverse effects in counteracting aging process, the exact mechanisms by which it modulates those processes are still controversial. Recent advances in CR research have suggested that the activation of autophagy is linked to the observed beneficial anti-aging effects. Evidence showed that CR induced a robust autophagy response in various metabolic tissues, and that the inhibition of autophagy attenuated the anti-aging effects of CR. The mechanisms by which CR modulates the complex process of autophagy have been investigated in depth. In this review, several major advances related to CR's anti-aging mechanisms and anti-aging mimetics will be discussed, focusing on the modification of the autophagy response.</AbstractText>"}

Onset in childhood is overwhelmingly due to adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy, while in adulthood, contributors include risk factors, such as obesity, male sex, and aging. More recently, there has been a precipitous increase in the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in youth. Drivers of this phenomenon include both increasing obesity and the survival of children with complex medical conditions into adulthood. Appropriate treatment and long-term management of obstructive sleep apnea is critical to ensure that these youth maintain well-being unfettered by secondary comorbidities. To this end, patient engagement and seamless transition of care from pediatric to adult health care systems is of paramount importance. To date, this is an unacknowledged and unmet need in most sleep programs.

Bones also fracture differently under slow and fast loadings, being ductile and brittle, respectively. The effects of a combination of these two factors have never been examined before. Here we show that cortical bone is most fracture-resistant at the physiologically prevalent intermediate strain rates of 10<sup>-</sup><sup>3</sup> s<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> such as they occur in walking or running, slightly weaker at slower quasistatic and much weaker at fast impact loading rates. In young cortical bone (15 years of age) the ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) occurs at strain rates of 10<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>, in old cortical bone (85 yrs) at speeds lower by a factor of 10 to 40. Other research has shown that the energy required to break bone (per unit of fracture surface) drops as much as 60% between these two ages. Therefore, DBT seems to compound the well-known phenomenon of 'brittle old bones'. Old bones can only cope with slow movement, young ones with both slow and fast movement. These observed material characteristics of (i) a shift of the DBT and (ii) a reduced energy absorption capacity appear to contribute at least as much to the loss of bone quality as the various quantity based (lowered bone density and mineral content) explanations of the past. They also provide a new powerful paradigm, which allows us to demonstrate mechanically, and uniquely, how human bone becomes increasingly brittle with age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The disease, however, existed already in the Roman times. The etiology of this disease remained enigmatic until the 1920s when two different mechanisms, lack of exposure to sunlight and lack of a dietary factor were finally solved by the discovery of vitamin D and its dual origin. Soon thereafter, the implementation of vitamin D supplementation for all infants and small children largely eliminated nutritional rickets in Europe and North America. It took nearly a century to elucidate the complex chemistry, metabolism, mode and spectrum of activity of the vitamin D endocrine system. Nutritional rickets, whether due to simple vitamin D or calcium deficiency or both, remains widely ravaging many infants and children around the world. Asian countries and the Middle East are mainly confronted with vitamin D deficiency whereas many African and some Asian countries face calcium deficiency rickets. Immigrants and refugees or in general people with a darker skin living in moderate climate zone are also confronted with this disease. There is great consensus how this disease could be prevented or cured.

Older adults show disturbances in this dynamic functional recruitment. There is evidence suggesting that cognitive-control training may enable older adults to redistribute their brain activation across cortical and subcortical networks, which in turn can limit behavioral impairments. However, previous studies have only focused on spatial rather than on temporal aspects of changes in brain activation. In the present study, we examined training-related functional plasticity in old age by applying a hybrid fMRI design that sensitively tracks the spatio-temporal interactions underlying brain-activation changes. Fifty healthy seniors were assigned to a task-shifting training or an active-control group and their pretest/posttest activation-change maps were compared against 25 untrained younger adults. After training, older adults showed the same performance as untrained young adults. Compared to the control group, task-shifting training promoted proactive (i.e., early, cue-related) changes in transient mechanisms supporting the maintenance and top-down biasing of task-set representations in a specific prefrontal circuitry; reactive (i.e., late, probe-related) changes in transient mechanisms supporting response-selection processes in dissociable fronto-parietal networks; overall reductions of sustained activation in striatal circuits.

We examined the performance of healthy middle-aged adults (40-55 years of age; n = 32) in relation to healthy young (18-25 years of age; n = 57) and older adults (65+ years of age; n = 55) on variations of recognition discriminability (RD) indices derived from the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II). Middle-aged adults performed significantly worse (<i>p</i>s &lt; .05) than young adults on multiple RD indices that incorporate semantically related distractor items, suggesting memory changes in middle age may be associated with increased susceptibility to semantic interference. Moreover, middle-aged adults performed comparably to older adults across all RD indices, indicating the recognition profile of middle-aged adults on RD indices more closely resembles that of older adults than young adults.</AbstractText>"}

Currently, a shortage of gerontological social workers trained specifically to work with this population exists, and based on projections, this shortage will only become more critical over the next few decades. In order to address this shortage, one approach has been adopted that seeks to increase the number of gerontological social work faculty, who can then encourage Bachelor and Master of Social Work students to consider working with older adults, and prepare them with the knowledge and skills necessary for doing so.

In this study, we examined how an anxious versus calm mood state affected younger and older adults' processing of emotional faces. Older adults had greater difficulty identifying negative emotions, particularly when emotions were displayed at a low intensity level. However, an anxious mood did not affect age differences in emotional face recognition. In contrast, age, emotional intensity, and current mood state all affected the perceived intensity of emotion. The effects of age and mood on perceived emotional intensity were only observed for low intensity facial expressions. When induced into an anxious mood, younger adults perceived threatening emotions (i.e., fear, anger) as more emotionally intense, whereas older adults perceived anger and happiness to be more intense. These findings emphasize the need to consider both internal and external factors when investigating the effects of age on emotional face processing.</AbstractText>"}

The present study examined the memory recall capacity of young and older adults in an EM task which used the number of 2, 4 and 6 items associated with specific space-temporal contexts. The young adults showed better performance coefficients than the older adults in all tasks, regardless of the load used, for all questions, except the 'What' type.

Appraisal theories of emotion posit that differences in emotional experience are the result of differences in appraisal. As such, age differences in appraisal may relate to age differences in emotion. To investigate this, the present study focused on appraisals of control. Research suggests that losses of control lead to greater negative affect. Therefore, older adulthood was predicted to be associated with increased appraisal of self-control and less negative affect. To investigate this idea, we used an emotionally ambiguous scenario paradigm. Older and younger participants read fourteen ambiguous scenarios, imaging themselves as the main character. After each scenario, participants appraised the scenarios on three different control dimensions: <i>self-, other</i>-, and <i>circumstantial-control</i>. Afterward, they rated their feelings toward the scenarios on seven different emotional states. The results showed that compared to younger adults, older adults appraised more self-control relative to other- and circumstantial-control, and also experienced less negative affect in response to the scenarios. Importantly, in a mediation analysis, self-control relative to other-control explained age differences in emotional reactions toward the scenarios. This finding reflects the importance of considering the role of appraisal in age differences in emotional experience.</AbstractText>"}

Higher-grade chondrosarcomas contain higher levels of expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor. The phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase enzymes SphK1 and SphK2 generates sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which inhibits human chondrosarcoma cell migration, while SphK1 overexpression suppresses lung metastasis of chondrosarcoma. We sought to determine whether S1P mediates levels of PDGF-A expression and angiogenesis in chondrosarcoma. Surprisingly, our investigations found that treatment of chondrosarcoma cells with S1P and transfecting them with SphK1 cDNA increased PDGF-A expression and induced angiogenesis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Ras, Raf, MEK, ERK and AP-1 inhibitors and their small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibited S1P-induced PDGF-A expression and EPC angiogenesis.

However, since the solubility enhancement has finite longevity (it is a 'kinetic solubility' effect), characterizing its duration (i.e., the so-called 'parachute' effect) can be important for optimizing a formulation with regard to its <i>in vivo</i> exposure. Two semiempirical models, based on dispersive kinetics theory, are evaluated for their ability to precisely describe experimental transients depicting a loss in supersaturation (initially generated by the dissolution of the amorphous phase) over time, as the solubilized drug recrystallizes. It is found that in cases where the drug solubility significantly exceeds that of the crystal at longer times, the mechanism has substantial 'denucleation' (dissolution) character. On the other hand, 'nucleation and growth' (recrystallization) kinetics best describe systems in which the recrystallization goes to completion within the experimental time frame. Kinetic solubility profiles taken from the recent literature are modeled for the following drugs: glibenclamide, indomethacin, loratadine, and terfenadine. In the last case, a combination of three different kinetic models, two classical ones plus the dispersive model, are used together in describing the entire dissolution-recrystallization transient of the drug, obtaining a fit of <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.993. By precisely characterizing the duration of the 'parachute' <i>in vitro</i> (e.g., under biorelevant conditions), the proposed models can be useful in predicting trends and thereby guiding formulation development and optimization.</AbstractText>"}

It has been estimated that 10% to 20% of individuals above 65 years of age will be diagnosed as having MCI. The increased rate of dementia and the importance of early detection of its forerunners have encouraged researchers to focus on detecting MCI and modifiable risk factors with the hope of developing better ways of managing dementia and its consequences. The main aim of this study was to systematically review the related literature concerning the cognitive changes in the spectrum of cognitive aging to cognitive impairment. Articles included in this review were identified through searching the databases of PubMed, Psych Info, Embase, ProQuest, and Scopus. Many domains like verbal memory, language, executive function, visual memory, attentional skills, and working memory showed acceptable predictive power. Testing subdomains such as executive function, speed of processing, working memory and semantic language are critical and others may indicate some suggestions for further clinical deteriorations in normal individuals. Although various cognitive instruments have been used for evaluation of impaired cognitive domains, it remains challenging to select the most appropriate ones having high-level accuracy and their related cognitive subdomains. It also revealed that none of the identified cognitive domains solely fulfilled the criteria for MCI screening; in clinical settings, multiple neuropsychological batteries may be used for one single cognitive domain, while longitudinal studies prefer the use of at least two cognitive measures for each domain to improve accuracy and research settings might focus on only a single neuropsychological test. However, along with episodic memory, testing for amnestic MCI, executive function could increase the chance of early detection of MCI. Executive control has been found to deteriorate the earliest in MCI patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Accumulating evidence over the last few years indicates that not only primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), but also cells defining the microenvironment of the BM (BM niche), sense hematopoietic stress signals. They respond by directing and orchestrating hematopoiesis via not only cell-intrinsic but also cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Inflammation has many beneficial roles by activating the immune system in tissue repair and as a defense mechanism. However, chronic inflammation can have detrimental effects by stressing HSPCs, leading to cell (DNA) damage resulting in BM failure or even to leukemia. Emerging data have demonstrated that the BM microenvironment plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies, in particular, through disrupted inflammatory signaling, specifically in niche (microenvironmental) cells. Clonal selection in the context of microenvironmental alterations can occur in the context of toxic insults (eg, chemotherapy), not only aging but also inflammation. In this review, we summarize mechanisms that lead to an inflammatory BM microenvironment and discuss how this affects normal hematopoiesis. We pay particular attention to the process of aging, which is known to involve low-grade inflammation and is also associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis and potentially malignant transformation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

We compared the long non-coding RNA levels in gastric cancer (GC) and para-cancerous tissues in the Gene Expression Omnibus, and found that small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (<i>SNHG12</i>) was upregulated in GC tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that <i>SNHG12</i> is overexpressed in GC tissues. We then used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to assess the association of <i>SNHG12</i> expression with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of GC patients and found that higher <i>SNHG12</i> expression was associated with a greater tumor invasion depth and poorer survival. <i>In vitro</i>, silencing <i>SNHG12</i> suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Overexpressing <i>SNHG12</i> had the opposite effects. In xenografted mice, knocking down <i>SNHG12</i> reduced GC tumor growth. Taken together, cancer pathway microarray and bioinformatics analyses, RNA pulldown assays, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that <i>SNHG12</i> induces GC tumorigenesis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway. <i>SNHG12</i> may thus be a useful marker for predicting poor survival in GC patients.</AbstractText>"}

However, how ApoE affects mitochondrial function and its proteins such as Sirt3 remains unclear.We characterized and compared levels of Sirt3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α, a Sirt3 activator), oxidative stress proteins, synaptic proteins, cognitive task performance and ATP production in 12-month old human ApoE4 and ApoE3 transgenic mice, and assessed changes in Sirt3 expression on cellular metabolism in primary neurons from ApoE4 and ApoE3 transgenic mice.Compared to ApoE3 mice, Sirt3 and PGC-1α levels were significantly lower in ApoE4 mice. Learning and memory, synaptic proteins, the NAD+/ NADH ratios, and ATP production were significantly lower in ApoE4 mice as well. Sirt3 knockdown reduced the oxygen consumption and ATP production in primary neurons with the human ApoE3, while Sirt3 overexpression protected these damages in ApoE4 neurons.Our findings suggest that ApoE4 suppresses mitochondrial function via the PGC-1α- Sirt3 pathway.

However, limited understanding of the structure and properties of individual micrometer-sized particulates obscures investigating the contributions of iron toward chemical activities. Here, we describe multidimensional analytical strategies to characterize the mass, spatial distribution, and chemical forms of iron in single haze particles using synchrotron radiation techniques. We first used X-ray fluorescence imaging to quantify the masses of multiple metals and yielded distribution maps of transition metals, which revealed the types of elements that tend to occur together. Additionally, we employed nanocomputed tomography to assess the spatial distribution of iron and observed that iron exists as small aggregates and is concentrated primarily in subsurface regions. We also combined X-ray absorption near structures with scanning transmission X-ray microscopy to quantify the ferrous and ferric forms and mapped their distributions in individual particles, which probably attribute chemical activity of iron. In conclusion, we demonstrated the power of synchrotron radiation-based techniques to study heretofore inaccessible chemical information in single haze particles, which may provide important clues about iron chemistry as a source of Fenton reactions and health effects. The multifaceted analytical approaches exhibit high sensitivity (subfemtogram per particle or ∼0.2 fg/μm<sup>2</sup>) toward multiple elements and are promising to be used for studying other concepts such as the solubility of aerosol iron, the heterogeneous oxidation of organic matters and SO<sub>2</sub>, and the formation and the aging of haze particles.</AbstractText>"}

To address this fundamental question, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available literature investigating the magnitude of senescence and its association with chronological age in human tissue samples.

Aged FTLs demonstrate high-quality sensory characteristics, while unaged FTLs do not. Microbes play important roles in the FTL fermentation process. However, the eukaryotic microbial community diversity is poorly understood, as are microbial associations within FTLs. We aimed to characterize and compare the microbiota associated with two important categories, fresh and strong flavor style FTLs, and to reveal correlations between the microbial taxa within them. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing, the community richness and diversity of prokaryotes were almost as high as that of eukaryotes. The dominant microbes of FTLs belonged to seven genera, including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Methylobacterium, Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, Neophaeosphaeria, and Cladosporium, of the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ascomycota phyla. According to partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Xanthomonas, Franconibacter, Massilia, Quadrisphaera, Staphylococcus, Cladosporium, Lodderomyces, Symmetrospora, Golovinomyces, and Dioszegia were significantly positively correlated with fresh flavor style FTLs, while Xenophilus, Fusarium, unclassified Ustilaginaceae, Tilletiopsis, Cryphonectria, Colletotrichum, and Cyanodermella were significantly positively correlated with strong flavor style FTLs. Network analysis identified seven hubs, Aureimonas, Kocuria, Massilia, Brachybacterium, Clostridium, Dietzia, and Vishniacozyma, that may play important roles in FTL ecosystem stability, which may be destroyed by Myrmecridium. FTL microbiota was found to be correlated with flavor style. Species present in lower numbers than the dominant microbes might be used as microbial markers to discriminate different flavor style samples and to stabilize FTL microbial communities. This research advances our understanding of FTL microbiota and describes a means of discriminating between fresh and strong flavor FTLs based on their respective stable microbiota.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Present guidelines for pneumonia management are based on a pathogen-oriented strategy that relies on the optimal application of antibiotics. Older pneumonia inpatients show the high incidence of aspiration pneumonia. The main cause of aspiration pneumonia is an impairment in the swallowing and cough reflexes. These facts suggest a limitation of present management strategies and a requirement for new strategies for aspiration pneumonia. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle strength and mass, and declining physical function with aging. Recently, a decrease in the mass or strength of the swallowing muscles was suggested to be associated with reduced swallowing function. Accordingly, dysphagia caused by sarcopenia of the systemic and swallowing-related muscles was named sarcopenic dysphagia. Presently, few studies have shown associations between aspiration pneumonia and sarcopenic dysphagia. As for the cough reflex, strong cough prevents aspiration pneumonia, and its strength is regulated by respiratory muscles. A few studies have reported a relationship between muscles and pneumonia in older people. Sarcopenia is a risk factor for pneumonia in older people, and aspiration pneumonia inpatients with low muscle mass show high mortality rates. Aspiration pneumonia induced muscle atrophy in respiratory, swallowing, and skeletal muscles in an animal model and humans. Associations between respiratory muscle strength and pneumonia are currently under investigation. Evaluation and management of sarcopenia could potentially become a new strategy to prevent and treat pneumonia in older patients, and research has only recently been launched.

In this study, we investigated the potential roles of WIN, as well as its underlying mechanism in a rat CCH model of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Hippocampal morphological changes and mitochondrial ultrastructure were detected using hematoxylin and eosin staining and electron microscopy, respectively. Various biomarkers, such as reactive oxidative species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were used to assess the level of oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the expression levels of neuronal nuclei (NeuN), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 signaling proteins, cleaved Caspase-9 and -3, and cytochrome-c (Cyt-C) were accessed by western blotting. CCH decreased the levels of NeuN, Cyt-C (mitochondrial), SOD, and CAT, and increased the levels of MDA, phosphorylated ASK1 and phosphorylated p38, cleaved Caspase-9 and -3, and Cyt-C (cytoplasm), which were reversed by WIN treatment. Chronic treatment with WIN also improved CCH-induced neuronal degeneration and mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings indicated that WIN may be a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic neuronal damage, involving a mechanism associated with the suppression of oxidative stress and ASK1-p38 signaling.</AbstractText>"}

Since the identification of biomarkers that can discriminate people of different age and health status has recently attracted a great interest, we wondered whether age-specific changes in the metabolome could be identified and serve as new and informative biomarkers of aging and longevity. In the last few years, a specific branch of metabonomics devoted to the study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been developed. To date, little is known about the profile of specific VOCs in healthy aging and longevity in humans; therefore, we investigated the profile of VOCs in both urine and feces samples from 73 volunteers of different age including centenarians that represent useful 'super-controls' to identify potential biomarkers of successful aging and footprints of longevity. To this purpose, we performed a discriminant analysis by which we were able to identify specific profiles of urinary and fecal VOCs. Such profiles can discriminate different age groups, from young to centenarians, and, even more interesting, centenarians' offspring from age-matched controls.

Despite new-generation TAVR devices and enhanced operator skills, cerebrovascular events (CVEs) carry on being one of the most severe complications, increasing morbi-mortality. CVE might be under reported because there are few studies with rigorous neurological clinical assessment. Several imaging studies show most of CVE after TAVR has a probable embolic etiology. The risk of CVE ranges from 2.7% to 5.5% at 30 days. As TAVR expands to younger and lower risk patients, the prevention of stroke plays an increasingly important role.

However, current literature is devoid of information relating to the physicochemical characterisation of NR and its respective impact upon formulation and final product processing. Here we report physicochemical properties of NR including p<i>K</i>a, log <i>P</i>, solubility, melting point, degradation mechanics, and kinetics, with a special focus on its stability under thermal and physiologically relevant conditions. A simple and rapid HPLC method confirms a base-catalysed hydrolysis degradation of NRCl to nicotinamide and sugar in simulated gastrointestinal (GI) fluids. Given the antagonising effect of nicotinamide against NR, the presented data have a profound impact on how NRCl should be handled both during formulation and storage to prevent formation and to limit accumulation of nicotinamide. The innovative combinatorial use of <sup>1</sup>H NMR and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was employed to investigate thermal events during NR melting. NRCl degrades upon melting and in solution undergoes hydrolysis in a buffer and in simulated intestinal environments. The results suggest that a proper and evidence-based formulation of NRCl is vital to enable further investigation and clinical analysis of this promising and novel nutrient. Any formulation would need to promote the stability of NRCl and protect it from hostile environments to prevent the accumulation of a potentially antagonistic degradation product. With the current work, we have filled a niche but vital gap in NR literature and the data presented may prove useful in furthering the understanding, specifically the formulation and processing of NRCl.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Michael T.D.

The HSC niches comprise a complex and dynamic molecular network of interactions across multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, osteoblasts, adipocytes, neuroglial cells and mature hematopoietic cells. Upon aging, functional changes in the HSC niches, such as microenvironmental senescence, imbalanced bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation, vascular remodeling, changes in adrenergic signaling and inflammation, coordinately and dynamically influence the fate of HSC and their downstream progeny. The end result is lymphoid deficiency and myeloid skewing. During this process, aged HSC and their derivatives remodel the niche to favor myeloid expansion. Therefore, the crosstalk between HSC and the microenvironment is indispensable for the aging of the hematopoietic system and might represent a therapeutic target in age-related pathological disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is of extreme importance that these cells maintain self-renewal and differentiation potential over time in order to preserve homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. Many of the intrinsic aspects of HSC are affected by the aging process resulting in a deterioration in their potential, independently of their microenvironment. Here we review recent findings characterizing most of the intrinsic aspects of aged HSC, ranging from phenotypic to molecular alterations. Historically, DNA damage was thought to be the main cause of HSC aging. However, over recent years, many new findings have defined an increasing number of biological processes that intrinsically change with age in HSC. Epigenetics and chromatin architecture, together with autophagy, proteostasis and metabolic changes, and how they are interconnected, are acquiring growing importance for understanding the intrinsic aging of stem cells. Given the increase in populations of older subjects worldwide, and considering that aging is the primary risk factor for most diseases, understanding HSC aging becomes particularly relevant also in the context of hematologic disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Research on intrinsic mechanisms responsible for HSC aging is providing, and will continue to provide, new potential molecular targets to possibly ameliorate or delay aging of the hematopoietic system and consequently improve the outcome of hematologic disorders in the elderly. The niche-dependent contributions to hematopoietic aging are discussed in another review in this same issue of the Journal.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The heterogeneity is believed to promote metastasis and resistance to chemoradiotherapy. MIA PaCa-2, an established human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line, contains round and spindle-shaped adherent cells, as well as, round floating cells. In this study, we aimed to assess if the floating cells might have greater metastatic potential and/or be more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis compared to adherent cells. Time-lapse analysis revealed that the two types of adherent cells transformed bilaterally, and some of the adherent, round cells converted to floating cells. Flow cytometry and electron microscopy showed that approximately 90% of the floating cells were viable. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that floating cells expressed lower levels of integrins and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters than adherent cells. In contrast, except for vimentin, floating cells expressed more epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers than adherent cells. Floating cells included a larger population of G2/M-phase cells, and migration assays revealed a decreased migration ability by floating cells relative to adherent cells. A cell aggregation assay showed that the aggregative properties of the floating cells were lower than those of the adherent cells. In 3D culture, spheres derived from floating cells were more sensitive to anti-cancer drugs, including gemcitabine, 5-FU, and abraxane, than those derived from adherent cells. Expression levels of stemness markers in the spheres derived from floating cells were lower than those derived from adherent cells. Morphological characterization of human PDAC cell lines may help to clarify the series of alterations cancer cells undergo during the metastatic process and may contribute to the development of new PDAC diagnostics and more patient-specific treatments for those with PDAC.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Two INM proteins in yeast are selectively imported. Their sorting signals consist of a nuclear localization signal, separated from the transmembrane domain by a long intrinsically disordered (ID) linker. We used computational models to predict the dynamic conformations of ID linkers and analyzed the INM targeting efficiency of proteins with linker regions with altered Stokes radii and decreased flexibilities. We find that flexibility, Stokes radius, and the frequency at which the linkers are at an extended end-to-end distance larger than 25 nm are good predictors for the targeting of the proteins. The data are consistent with a transport mechanism in which INM targeting of Heh2 is dependent on an ID linker that facilitates the crossing of the approximately 25-nm thick NPC scaffold.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in which cases low T3 syndrome typically leads to adverse outcomes remain unclear. Of 1,432 AHF patients screened, 1,190 were enrolled. Euthyroidism was present in 956 patients (80.3%), who were divided into 2 groups: the normal group (n = 445, FT3 ≥1.88 µIU/L) and low-FT3 group (n = 511, FT3 &lt;1.88 µIU/L). The survival rates and event-free rates within 365 days were significantly lower in the low-FT3 group than in the normal group. A multivariate Cox regression model showed that the low-FT3 group was an independent predictor of 365-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.429, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.013 to 2.015) and HF events (HR 1.349, 95% CI 1.047 to 1.739). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (per 10-year old increase, odds ratio [OR]: 1.186, 95% CI: 1.046 to 1.345) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI; per 1-point increase, OR: 1.067, 95% CI: 1.046 to 1.089) were independently associated with the low-FT3 group. The prognosis in patients with a low PNI and over 75 years old, including all-cause death within 365 days, was significantly poorer in the low-FT3 group than in the normal group. In conclusion, adverse outcomes were predicted by the presence of low T3. AHF patients with low T3 syndrome are strongly associated with aging and malnutrition. Low T3 syndrome complicated with older age and malnutrition is likely to lead to adverse outcomes in patients with AHF.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aim to (1) investigate whether electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to distinguish between individual functional networks of young and old adults; and (2) identify the functional connections that contribute to this classification. Two eyes-open resting-state EEG recording sessions with 64 electrodes for each of 22 younger adults (19-37 years) and 22 older adults (63-85 years) were conducted. For each session, imaginary coherence matrices in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were computed. A range of machine learning classification methods were utilized to distinguish younger and older adult brains. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was 93% accurate in classifying the brains by age group. We report decreased functional connectivity with older age in delta, theta, alpha and gamma bands, and increased connectivity with older age in beta band. Most connections involving frontal, temporal, and parietal electrodes, and more than half of connections involving occipital electrodes, showed decreased connectivity with older age. Slightly less than half of the connections involving central electrodes showed increased connectivity with older age. Functional connections showing decreased strength with older age were not significantly different in electrode-to-electrode distance than those that increased with older age. Most of the connections used by the classifier to distinguish participants by age group belonged to the alpha band.

Thal phase is based on a neuroanatomical hierarchy of Aβ-deposition, and in combination with Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging also allows derivation of primary age-related tauopathy (PART). We sought to determine whether Thal Aβ phase predicts dementia better than CERAD in a population-representative cohort (n = 186) derived from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was quantitied as the number of neuroanatomical areas involved and cases meeting criteria for PART were defined to determine if they are a distinct pathological group within the ageing population. Agreement with the Thal scheme was excellent. In univariate analysis Thal phase performed less well as a predictor of dementia than CERAD, Braak or CAA. Logistic regression, decision tree and linear discriminant analysis were performed for multivariable analysis, with similar results. Thal phase did not provide a better explanation of dementia than CERAD, and there was no additional benefit to including more than one assessment of Aβ in the model. Number of areas involved by CAA was highly correlated with assessment based on a severity score (p &lt; 0.001). The presence of capillary involvement (CAA type I) was associated with higher Thal phase and Braak stage (p &lt; 0.001). CAA was not associated with microinfarcts (p = 0.1). Cases satisfying pathological criteria for PART were present at a frequency of 10.2% but were not older and did not have a higher likelihood of dementia than a comparison group of individuals with similar Braak stage but with more Aβ. They also did not have higher hippocampal-tau stage, although PART was weakly associated with increased presence of thorn-shaped astrocytes (p = 0.048), suggesting common age-related mechanisms. Thal phase is highly applicable in a population-representative setting and allows definition of pathological subgroups, such as PART. Thal phase, plaque density, and extent and type of CAA measure different aspects of Aβ pathology, but addition of more than one Aβ measure does not improve dementia prediction, probably because these variables are highly correlated. Machine learning predictions reveal the importance of combining neuropathological measurements for the assessment of dementia.</AbstractText>"}

In healthy subjects, we aimed to investigate whether leukocyte TL (LTL) associated with family history of coronary heart disease (CHD), age, sex and lifestyle, and further potential covariations between LTL, GDF11, SIRT1 and selected pro-inflammatory markers. Material and Methods In 118 healthy subjects (18-81years, 58% females), whole blood was collected for DNA and RNA isolation and PCR relative quantification of LTLs and gene-expression of SIRT1, GDF11, interleukin (IL)-18 and interferon (IFN)ƴ, respectively, and serum SIRT1 and IL-18 analyses. Results Shorter LTLs associated with a 7 fold higher frequency of hereditary CHD in subjects with LTLs in quartile (Q)1 compared to Q2-4 (OR=7.5, 95% CI 2.5-21.6, p&lt;0.001, adjusted). We also observed that LTLs in Q4 compared to Q1-3 associated with higher leukocyte expression of SIRT1 and GDF11 (p=0.052 and p=0.058), lower IFNƴ expression (p=0.009) and lower circulating IL-18 levels (p=0.027). SIRT1 and GDF11 expression were strongly inter-correlated (Spearman rho=0.85, p&lt;0.001). Overall, smoking, snus and alcohol consumption were not associated with LTLs. Conclusion The observed shorter LTLs in association with elevated expression of SIRT1 and GDF11 and dampened inflammation in hereditary-CHD-subjects, suggest impending risk of disease.

In this study, using in silico approaches and gene expression data, on a multicentric cohort composed of 208 snap-frozen tumor biopsies, we explored the subtype-specific molecular alterations that regulate tumor aggressiveness in stage I EOC. We found that single genes rather than pathways are responsible for histotype specificities and that a cAMP-PKA-CREB1 signaling axis seems to play a central role in histotype differentiation.

One of the most common findings across these nuclei is a loss of synaptic inhibition with aging, which has been proposed to be at the heart of several aging-related changes in auditory cognition, including diminished speech perception in complex environments and the presence of tinnitus. Some authors have speculated that downregulation of synaptic inhibition is a consequence of peripheral deafferentation and therefore is a homeostatic mechanism to restore excitatory/inhibitory balance. As such, disinhibition would represent a form of maladaptive plasticity. However, clinical data suggest that deafferentation-related disinhibition tends to occur primarily in the aged brain. Therefore, aging-related disinhibition may, in part, be related to the high metabolic demands of inhibitory neurons relative to their excitatory counterparts. These findings suggest that both deafferentation-related maladaptive plastic changes and aging-related metabolic factors combine to produce changes in central auditory function. Here, we explore the arguments that downregulation of inhibition may be due to homeostatic responses to diminished afferent input vs. metabolic vulnerability of inhibitory neurons in the aged brain. Understanding the relative importance of these mechanisms will be critical for the development of treatments for the underlying causes of aging-related central disinhibition.</AbstractText>"}

Smoking, the second leading health risk factors associated with NCDs in China, disproportionately affects the old population more than their younger counterparts. Using survey data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this study evaluated the impact of changes in cigarette affordability on smoking behavior among middle-aged and elderly (age 45 and older) smokers. Self-reported cigarette price and disposable income were used to calculate cigarette affordability. Cigarette consumption was measured using the number of cigarettes smoked per day reported by the survey respondents. The correlation between cigarette affordability and cigarette consumption was estimated using generalized estimating equations adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, geolocations, and cigarette price tiers, as well as year fixed effects. The estimated overall conditional cigarette affordability elasticity of demand was -0.165, implying a 10% decrease in cigarette affordability would result in a reduction in cigarette consumption by 1.65%. The cigarette affordability responsiveness differs by demographics, socioeconomic status, geolocations, and cigarette price tiers. This study provides evidence that tax/price policies that reduce cigarette affordability could lead to a decrease in cigarette consumption among middle-aged and elderly smokers in China. Smoke-free laws, as well as minimum price regulations, may be needed to compliment excise tax policy to target specific smoking subgroups whose cigarette consumption is less sensitive to changes in cigarette affordability.</AbstractText>"}

This can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction with harmful consequences for the cells and the whole organism, resulting in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dementia, and aging. To protect themselves from ROS, mitochondria are equipped with an efficient antioxidant system, which includes low-molecular-mass molecules and enzymes able to scavenge ROS or repair the oxidative damage. In the mitochondrial membranes, a major role is played by the lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E, which reacts with the peroxyl radicals faster than the molecules of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and in doing so, protects membranes from excessive oxidative damage. In the present review, we summarize the available data concerning the capacity of vitamin E supplementation to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage in hyperthyroidism, a condition that leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative damage. Vitamin E supplementation to hyperthyroid animals limits the thyroid hormone-induced increases in mitochondrial ROS and oxidative damage. Moreover, it prevents the reduction of the high functionality components of the mitochondrial population induced by hyperthyroidism, thus preserving cell function.</AbstractText>"}

It is highly curable, with a 10-year relative survival approaching 95% due to effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Given the increasing incidence of TC and improved survival, TC survivors (TCS) now account for approximately 4% of all US male cancer survivors. They have also become a valuable cohort for adult-onset cancer survivorship research, given their prolonged survival. Commensurately, long-term treatment-related complications have emerged as important survivorship issues. These late effects include life-threatening conditions, such as second malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, TCS can also experience hearing loss, tinnitus, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hypogonadism, infertility, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, and chronic cancer-related fatigue. Characterization of the number and severity of long-term adverse health outcomes among TCS remains critical to develop risk-stratified, evidence-based follow-up guidelines and to inform the development of preventive measures and interventions. In addition, an improved understanding of the long-term effects of TC treatment on mortality due to noncancer causes and second malignant neoplasms remains paramount. Future research should focus on the continued development of large, well-characterized clinical cohorts of TCS for lifelong follow-up. These systematic, comprehensive approaches can provide the needed infrastructure for further investigation of long-term latency patterns of various medical and psychosocial morbidities and for more in-depth studies investigating associated etiopathogenetic pathways.

In this context, antioxidants play a significant role in encountering free radicals by delaying or reducing the oxidative damage of cells. Evidence suggests that synthetic antioxidants are double-edged swords wherefore the requirement for natural antioxidants is increasing globally. Exploring non-toxic, biodegradable and compatible natural molecules like exopolysaccharides can favour the current antioxidant limitations. Microbial exopolysaccharides represent a structurally diverse class of carbohydrate molecules secreted at the cell wall. Recently, bioprospecting exopolysaccharides for their astounding physiochemical properties and the reliable structure-activity relationship have motivated more research towards the investigation of their antioxidant properties. Here we propose that structural features of exopolysaccharides such as monosaccharide residues, branching, molecular weight, glycosidic linkage, functional groups, protein, selenium, and chemical modifications are likely to influence their antioxidant activity. To support this hypothesis we review the interdependence of structural features of exopolysaccharides to the observed antioxidant activity. In light of its importance, this review focuses on the understanding of the elimination of free radicals by microbial exopolysaccharides derived from marine and nonmarine sources during the last six years.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Importantly, iNPH has not previously been associated with stuttering, and shunting has not been shown to alleviate the symptom of stuttering. Here, the authors report two cases of patients with iNPH presenting with stuttering that resolved after ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement. Each patient presented with gait difficulty, incontinence, cognitive impairment and stuttering. Lasting improvements of the symptoms (including stuttering) were seen in both patients after CSF drainage procedures that included lumbar puncture, extended lumbar CSF drainage, placement of a VP shunt, and VP shunt revision. These findings suggest that iNPH can present with stuttering or dysarthria. The significant improvement in stuttering and dysarthria, along with the improvements in gait difficulty, incontinence, and cognitive impairment that occurred after CSF drainage, suggests that the motor apraxia observed in NPH can affect speech production. Practitioners should be aware that iNPH can present with stuttering, and that CSF drainage can improve stuttering in select circumstances.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

With no specific therapy available to date, identification of mechanisms underlying vascular fibrogenesis is an important clinical goal. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2), a collagen-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, is a determinant of arterial fibrosis. We report a significant increase in collagen type 1 levels along with collagen and ECM remodeling, degradation of elastic laminae, enhanced fat deposition and calcification in the abdominal aorta in a non-human primate model of high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFS)-induced metabolic syndrome. These changes were associated with a marked increase in DDR2. Resveratrol attenuated collagen type I deposition and remodeling induced by the HFS diet, with a concomintant reduction in DDR2. Further, in isolated rat vascular adventitial fibroblasts and VSMCs, hyperglycemia increased DDR2 and collagen type I expression via TGF-β1/SMAD2/3, which was attenuated by resveratrol. Notably, gene knockdown and overexpression approaches demonstrated an obligate role for DDR2 in hyperglycemia-induced increase in collagen type I expression in these cells. Together, our observations point to DDR2 as a hitherto unrecognized molecular link between metabolic syndrome and arterial fibrosis, and hence a therapeutic target.</AbstractText>"}

Estimates in the pool averaged 9.18 (± 0.25SE, range 1-14, n = 112 counts). Drone counts at 40 m produced the highest counts of hippos, 10.6% higher than land counts and drone counts at 80 m, and 17.6% higher than drone counts at 120 m. Fewer hippos were counted in the early morning, when the hippos were active and most likely submerged, compared to all other times of day, when they tended to rest in shallow water with their bodies exposed. We were able to assign age classes to similar numbers of hippos from land counts and counts at 40 m, although land counts were better at identifying juveniles and subadults. Early morning was the least effective time to age hippos given their active behaviour, increasingly problematic with increasing height. Use of a relatively low-cost drone provided a rigorous and repeatable method for estimating numbers and ages of hippos, other than in the early morning, compared to land counts, considered the most accurate method of counting hippos.</AbstractText>"}

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in various types of TNBC cells, and several EGFR-specific immunotherapies have been used to treat cancer patients. Chimeric antigen receptor engineered T (CAR-T) cells have also been used as cancer therapies. In this study, we generated two types of EGFR-specific CAR-modified T cells using lentiviral vectors with DNA sequences encoding the scFv regions of two anti-EGFR antibodies. The cytotoxic and antitumor effects of these CAR-modified T cells were examined in cytokine release and cytotoxicity assays <i>in vitro</i> and in tumor growth assays in TNBC cell line- and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Both types of EGFR-specific CAR-T cells were activated by high-EGFR-expressing TNBC cells and specifically triggered TNBC cell lysis <i>in vitro</i>. Additionally, the CAR-T cells inhibited growth of cell-line- and patient-derived xenograft TNBC tumors in mice. These results suggest that EGFR-specific CAR-T cells might be a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with high-EGFR-expressing TNBC.</AbstractText>"}

LncRNA LINC00958 has recently been shown to play crucial roles in the development of tumors. However, the role of LINC00958 in IDD remains unclear. We showed that the expression of lncRNA LINC00958 was upregulated in degenerative NP samples, and LINC00958 expression increased gradually along with the grade of exacerbation of disc degeneration. Ectopic expression of LINC00958 promoted nucleus pulposus (NP) cell proliferation, inhibited aggrecan and Col II expression and promoted MMP-2 and MMP-13 expression. In addition, we showed that miR-203 expression was downregulated in degenerative NP samples, and miR-203 expression reduced gradually along with the grade of exacerbation of disc degeneration. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-203 was inversely related with LINC00958 expression in NP samples. Ectopic expression of miR-203 inhibited NP cell growth and inhibited ECM degradation. Furthermore, we showed that ectopic expression of miR-203 suppressed the luciferase activity of the wild-type LINC00958 3'-UTR but not the mutant LINC00958 3'-UTR. Elevated expression of LINC00958 inhibited the expression of miR-203 and promoted the expression of SMAD3. In addition, we demonstrated that lncRNA LINC00958 exerted its function by targeting miR-203 in the NP cells. These data suggested that dysregulated lncRNA LINC00958 expression might play an important role in the development of IDD.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated the effects of aging on AKI-to-chronic kidney disease (CKD) transition, focusing on renal inflammation. Aged and young C57BL/6 mice were subjected to bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Baseline proinflammatory cytokine levels of kidneys were elevated in aged mice. After IRI, aged mice also showed persistent M1 dominant inflammation, with increased proinflammatory cytokines during the recovery phase. Persistent M1 inflammation was associated with blunted activation of CSF-1/IRF4 signal for M1/M2 polarization, but in vitro macrophage polarization with cytokine stimulation was not different between young and aged mononuclear cells. The tubular expressions of cell cycle arrest markers increased in aged mice during recovery phase, and in vitro transwell experiments showed that mononuclear cells or M1 macrophages co-cultured with arrested proximal tubular cells at G1 phase significantly impaired M2 polarization, suggesting that prolonged G1 arrest might be involved in persistent M1 inflammation in aged mice. Finally, M1 dominant inflammation in aged mice resulted in fibrosis progression. Our data show that impaired M2 polarization partially driven by senescent tubule cells with cell-cycle arrest may lead to an accelerated progression to CKD in the elderly.</AbstractText>"}

The silent information regulator of transcription1 (SIRT1) is a vital regulator of cell survival and life-span. SIRT1 has been shown to be activated by resveratrol treatment, and also has been proved to prevent aging-related diseases such as osteoporosis. However, the role of SIRT1 about autophagy or mitophagy of osteoblasts in resveratrol-regulated osteoporotic rats remains unclear. This study seeks to investigate the role of SIRT1 about autophagy or mitophagy in osteoblasts through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in resveratrol-regulated osteoporotic rats. The vivo experiment results have revealed that resveratrol treatment significantly improved bone quality and reduced the levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in osteoporotic rats. Moreover, Western bolt analysis showed that expression of SIRT1, LC3, and Beclin-1 in osteoblasts increased, while p-AKT and p-mTOR were downregulated in osteoporosis rats with high dose resveratrol treatment. On the other hand, resveratrol treatment increased the SIRT1 activity, LC3 and Beclin-1 mRNA expression in the dexamethasone (DEX)-treated osteoblasts. More mitophagosomes were observed in the DEX-treated osteoblasts with resveratrol. Meanwhile, the TOM20, Hsp60, p-Akt and p-mTOR activities were decreased in the DEX-treated osteoblasts with resveratrol. Resveratrol treatment did not change the p-p38 and p-JNK activities in the osteoblasts. These results revealed that resveratrol treatment protected osteoblasts in osteoporosis rats by enhancing mitophagy by mediating SIRT1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.</AbstractText>"}

Clinical ethics consultation is designed to provide a more objective 'outside' opinion and offer advice to the patient, family, and entire care team to support and guide decisions. Nurses are well positioned to initiate assistance from Clinical Ethics Consult Services in support of patient and family advocacy.

We also examined the role of age and other correlates. Using propensity score matching methods, we selected couples in both waves matched by age, relationship duration, and region within each study (COUPLES: 174 couples per wave, mean age = 30 in men and 27 in women; SHP: 1,071 couples per wave, mean age = 47 in men and 44 in women; and, BHPS: 316 couples per wave, mean age = 36 in men and 33 in women). Our results revealed that while women and men in the later wave reported more frequent conflict, women in the later wave reported more emotional and practical support from their partner, resulting in a smaller gender gap over historical time, and men in the later wave reported higher relationship satisfaction. Taken together, this pattern of historical differences is largely consistent with what would be expected based on increased egalitarianism.

For example, it has been hypothesized that the historically increasing flexibility of constructing social networks may influence the social development of adults into late life. To date, however, there is no established method in psychological science that allows researchers to easily gauge the effects of historical differences in time-varying covariates on aging trajectories, which are also subject to historical change. Here, the method of cohort centering is introduced as a potential remedy for this dilemma. Using a large-scale, cohort-sequential data set, representative of the German population aged 40 to 85 years (<i>N</i> = 19,017), I applied cohort centering to examine historical differences in the aging trajectories of number of friends in the close personal networks and time spent in activities with friends. The results indicated that older cohorts may be more engaged with friends than younger cohorts. Results also showed that historical differences in friendship relations in later life could partially be explained by historical gains in self-rated health, education, and individual perceptions of aging. In sum, cohort centering can tell us how future aging trajectories will look given a specific set of preconditions and can provide information about what could happen if these conditions change.

Findings indicate that network size, gender composition, and years known were similar in both cohorts. Changes are also evident. In 2005, network members were older, had more frequent contact, and lived closer to their network members than in 1980. There was 1 cohort difference in network composition, the proportion of other family was smaller in 2005 compared with 1980. Finally, cohorts differed in the effects of age (e.g., on contact frequency), closeness (e.g., on network size), and Age × Closeness interactions (e.g., on sibling composition). In sum, overall patterns of network structure and composition are largely similar in the 2 cohorts. The effects of age and emotional closeness were largely consistent over 25 years.

However, loneliness is a subjective perception that does not correspond perfectly with objective social circumstances. In this study, we examined whether perceived loneliness is greater among the Baby Boomers-individuals born 1948-1965-relative to those born 1920-1947 and whether older adults have become lonelier over the past decade (2005-2016). We used data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project and from the Health and Retirement Study collected during 2005-2016 to estimate differences in loneliness associated with age, birth year, and survey time point. Overall, loneliness decreased with age through the early 70s, after which it increased. We found no evidence that loneliness is substantially higher among the Baby Boomers or that it has increased over the past decade. Loneliness is, however, associated with poor health, living alone or without a spouse-partner, and having fewer close family and friends, which together accounted for the overall increase in loneliness after age 75. Although these data do not support the idea that older adults are becoming lonelier, the actual number of lonely individuals may increase as the Baby Boomers age into their 80s and beyond. Our results suggest that attention to social factors and improving health may help to mitigate this. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

To shed light on this pressing issue we investigated whether age-related changes in loneliness found in early studies also pertain to later-born cohorts, and whether mastery and self-efficacy have become increasingly important for explaining differences in loneliness. We used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Observations were of 4,880 Dutch people aged 55 and older between 1992 and 2016. We employed multilevel regression analyses incorporating birth cohort while controlling for age. Older adults were less lonely in later-born cohorts, although the effect size was small (<i>d</i> = .11 at Age 65 comparing Cohorts 1918-1927 and 1948-1957; and <i>d</i> = .11 at Age 75 comparing cohorts 1908-1917 and 1938-1947). Furthermore, we found a sharp age-related increase in loneliness; older people were lonelier than younger people (<i>d</i> = .83 comparing Ages 75 and 95 in Cohort 1908-1917; and <i>d</i> = .21 comparing Ages 55 and 78 in Cohort 1938-1947). Age effects thus clearly outweigh cohort effects in size. Increasing levels of mastery and self-efficacy across birth cohorts explain the observed cohort-related decline in loneliness. Mastery contributes similar to the effect size of partner status in the explanation of differences in loneliness. We conclude that there is no evidence of a loneliness epidemic among later-born cohorts of older adults relative to earlier-born cohorts. Also, mastery and self-efficacy are crucial to fully understanding loneliness in today's society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

In the current study, we addressed many of these limitations by examining how narcissism changed longitudinally in a sample of 747 participants (72.3% female) from Age 13 to Age 77 across 6 samples of participants born between 1923 and 1969. Narcissism was moderately stable across the life span (<i>r</i>s ranged from .37 to .52), to a comparable degree as other psychological characteristics. We found that more maladaptive forms of narcissism (e.g., hypersensitivity, willfulness) declined across life and individual autonomy increased across life. More later-born birth cohorts were lower in hypersensitivity and higher in autonomy compared with earlier-born birth cohorts; these differences were most apparent among those born after the 1930s.

Specifically, the authors examined whether such changes modulated the extent to which adolescents' intelligence (IQ), their grade point average (GPA), and their parents' socioeconomic status (SES) could predict key life outcomes in adulthood about 20 years later. The data stemmed from two representative U.S. birth cohorts of 15- and 16-year-olds who were born in the early 1960s (<i>N</i> = 3,040) and 1980s (<i>N</i> = 3,524) and who participated in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY). Cohort differences were analyzed with respect to differences in average relations by means of multiple and logistic regression and for specific points in each outcome distribution by means of quantile regressions. In both cohorts, IQ, GPA, and parental SES predicted important educational, occupational, and health-related life-outcomes about 20 years later. Across historical time, the predictive utility of adolescent IQ and parental SES remained stable for the most part. Yet, the combined effects of social-ecological and socioeconomic changes may have increased the predictive utility (that is, the regression weights) of adolescent GPA for educational, occupational, and health outcomes over time for individuals who were born in the 1980s. Theoretical implications concerning adult development, aging, and late life inequality are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

It is often noted how advances in educational attainment in childhood and adolescence may contribute to these historical improvements in cognitive aging. Less is known about the role of work environment in adulthood. Over the last century, work demands and characteristics have been changing profoundly, particularly with shifts from a manufacturing to a service and technical economy. In this article, we used data from the Seattle Longitudinal Study to compare age-related trajectories of cognitive change in five primary mental abilities between earlier-born (1901-1938) and later-born cohorts (1939-1966). Cohorts were matched on an observation-by-observation basis using age and retest, and analyses controlled for participants' gender and number of data points provided. We found that (a) later-born cohorts had higher levels of performance on most cognitive tasks and exhibited less age-related declines in word fluency; (b) later-born cohorts had more enriched perceived work environments, as indicated by higher levels of worker control and innovation, with no cohort differences in work autonomy; (c) these experiences were associated with higher levels of cognitive performance at age 55 years; (d) the effects of perceived work environment were independent of education; and (e) the effects of perceived work environment were consistent across cohorts. The findings suggest that perceived work environment is associated with cognitive functioning independently of education and invariably across historical time. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these associations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

Chemical peeling is a widely used cosmetic procedure in medical practice. This technique consists of the application of one or more chemical ablative agents to the skin's surface in order to induce keratolysis or keratocoagulation. Exfoliation is followed by skin and epidermal regeneration from the adjacent epithelium and skin adnexa. Moreover, through an inflammatory reaction and the activation of the inflammation mediators, an increase in fibroblastic synthesis and in the production of new collagen and glycosaminoglycan fibres is induced. After the first treatment session, the appearance and the texture of the skin are significantly improved. Peeling agents may be divided into superficial (epidermis-papillary dermis), medium-depth (papillary to upper reticular dermis) and deep subtypes based on the depth of their penetration (mid-reticular dermis).1 Superficial peel is mainly used for dyschromia, acne, post- inflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma and actinic keratosis. Medium depth peel mainly treats solar keratosis or lentigines, pigmentary disorders and superficial scars. Skin photo-ageing, deep scars or wrinkles and precancerous skin lesions require a deep chemical peeling. The aim of this article is to review recent advances in chemical peel of melasma and acne.</AbstractText>"}

Here we study the linear and non-linear viscoelastic properties of dragline silk obtained from social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum using a Micro-Extension Rheometer that we have developed. Unlike continuous extension data, our technique allows for the probing of the viscoelastic response by applying small perturbations about sequentially increasing steady-state strain values. In addition, we extend our analysis to obtain the characteristic stress relaxation times and the frequency responses of the viscous and elastic moduli. Using these methods, we show that in a small strain regime (0-4%) dragline silk of social spiders shows a strain softening response followed by a strain stiffening response at higher strains (&gt;4%). The stress relaxation time, on the other hand, increases monotonically with increasing strain for the entire range. We also show that the silk stiffens while ageing within the typical lifetime of a web. Our results demand the inclusion of the kinetics of domain unfolding and refolding in the existing models to account for the relaxation time behavior.</AbstractText>"}

A comparison with the evolution of the crystalline and amorphous fractions in the homopolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) was also performed. For all the samples, the crystallinity was found to slightly increase during storage. In parallel, the mobile amorphous fraction (MAF) decreased markedly, with the result that a relevant increase in the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) was detected. The RAF content in the copolymers was lower than that of PHB. For all the samples, the RAF formation during aging was ascribed to the growth of secondary crystals in geometrically restricted areas. It was demonstrated that the storage at <i>T</i><sub> <i>room</i> </sub> leads in PHB, PHBV8, and PHBV12 to a progressive increase in the total solid fraction (crystal phase + rigid amorphous fraction) and to a simultaneous physical aging of the rigid amorphous fraction. The two different processes cannot be separated and distinguished, so that only the resulting effect on the mechanical properties was considered. The experimental elastic modulus of both PHBV8 and PHBV12 was found to increase regularly with the total solid fraction, as well as the tensile strength. Conversely, the elongation at break turned out to be an increasing function of the mobile amorphous fraction. The elastic moduli of the crystalline, mobile amorphous, and rigid amorphous fractions of PHBV8 and PHBV12 were estimated by means of a three-phase modified Takayanagi's model, to take into account also the contribution of the rigid amorphous fraction.

Epidemiological studies demonstrated that depression has become one of the most important diseases affecting human health and longevity. The pathogenesis of the disease has not been fully elucidated. The clinical effect of treatment is not satisfactory in many cases. Neuroimaging studies have provided rich and valuable evidence that psychological symptoms and behavioral deficits in patients with depression are closely related to structural and functional abnormalities in specific areas of the brain. There were morphological differences in several brain regions, including the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and limbic system, in people with depression compared to healthy people. In addition, people with depression also had abnormal functional connectivity to the default mode network, the central executive network, and the salience network. These findings provide an opportunity to re-understand the biological mechanisms of depression.

Therefore, the objective of this review was to provide evidence-based guidelines for pre-participation screening, mobilization, and aerobic exercise training in the hyper-acute and acute phases post-stroke. In reviewing the literature to determine safe timelines of when to initiate exercise and mobilization we considered the following factors: arterial blood pressure dysregulation, cardiac complications, blood-brain barrier disruption, hemorrhagic stroke transformation, and ischemic penumbra viability. These stroke-related impairments could intensify with inappropriate mobilization/aerobic exercise, hence we deemed the integrity of cerebral autoregulation to be an essential physiological consideration to protect the brain when progressing exercise intensity. Pre-participation screening criteria are proposed and countermeasures to protect the brain from potentially adverse circulatory effects before, during, and following mobilization/exercise sessions are introduced. For example, prolonged periods of standing and static postures before and after mobilization/aerobic exercise may elicit blood pooling and/or trigger coagulation cascades and/or cerebral hypoperfusion. Countermeasures such as avoiding prolonged standing or incorporating periodic lower limb movement to activate the venous muscle pump could counteract blood pooling after an exercise session, minimize activation of the coagulation cascade, and mitigate potential cerebral hypoperfusion. We discuss patient safety in light of the complex nature of stroke presentations (i.e., type, severity, and etiology), medical history, comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiac manifestations, medications, and complications such as anemia and dehydration. The guidelines are easily incorporated into the care model, are low-risk, and use minimal resources. These and other strategies represent opportunities for improving the safety of the activity regimen offered to those in the early phases post-stroke. The timeline for initiating and progressing exercise/mobilization parameters are contingent on recovery stages both from neurobiological and cardiovascular perspectives, which to this point have not been specifically considered in practice. This review includes tailored exercise and mobilization prescription strategies and precautions that are not resource intensive and prioritize safety in stroke recovery.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Marzolini, Robertson, Oh, Goodman, Corbett, Du and MacIntosh.</CopyrightInformation>"}

{"PMID":31803048,"Title":"The Effect of Balance and Coordination Exercises on Quality of Life in Older Adults: A Mini-Review.","Journal":"Frontiers in aging neuroscience","Date":"2019","Keywords":"balance, coordination, exercise, older adults, quality of life","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The ability to control balance during activities of daily living (ADL) is impaired in older adults as a result of deterioration in the sensory systems (i.e., vestibular, visual, somatosensory), the cognitive system (central nervous system), and the musculoskeletal system. Consequently, many older adults face a risk of falling during their ADL. In most cases, falls and related injuries impair the quality of life and result in physical limitations, anxiety, loss of confidence, and fear of falling. Among a variety of fall prevention interventions, adapted physical activity programs have been suggested for improving balance control during ADL. These programs challenge the sensory, cognitive, and musculoskeletal systems while addressing balance constraints such as orientation in space, changes in direction, and the speed or height of the center of mass during static and dynamic situations resembling ADL. The above-mentioned elements can be dealt with through a combination of balance and coordination exercises that challenge the postural control systems in multiple dimensions-including vertical and horizontal changes of the center of mass, standing on unstable surfaces with a reduced base of support, and changing body directions. Consequently, such exercises require environmental information-processing. The combination of dual-task, function-oriented challenges while controlling balance stimulates the sensory and neuromuscular control mechanisms. Among older adults, these programs have been found to improve static and dynamic stability, as well as a number of aspects in the quality of life.

It's a chronic and untreatable neurodegenerative disease with irreversible progression and has important social and economic implications in terms of direct medical and social care costs. Despite prolonged and expensive efforts employed by the scientific community over the last few decades, no effective treatments are still available for patients, and the development of disease-modifying drugs is now a really urgent need. The recent failure of clinical trials based on the immunotherapeutic approach against amyloid-β(Aβ) protein questioned the validity of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' as the molecular machinery causing the disease. Indeed, most attempts to design effective treatments for AD have been based until now on molecular targets suggested to be implicated in AD pathogenesis by the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, mounting evidence from scientific literature supports the view of AD as a multifactorial disease that results from the concomitant action of multiple molecular players. This view, together with the lack of success of the disease-modifying single-target approaches, strongly suggests that AD drug design needs to be shifted towards multi-targeted compounds or drug combinations acting synergistically on the main core features of disease pathogenesis. The discovery of drug candidates targeting multiple factors involved in AD would greatly improve drug development. So, it is reasonable that upcoming strategies for the design of preventive and/or therapeutic agents for AD point to a multi-pronged approach including more than one druggable target to definitely defeat the disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Catania, Giaccone, Salmona, Tagliavini and Di Fede.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Out of every three AD patients, two are females with postmenopausal women contributing to over 60% of all those affected. Sex- and gender-related differences in AD have been widely researched and several emerging lines of evidence point to different vulnerabilities that contribute to dementia risk. Among those being considered, it is becoming widely accepted that gonadal steroids contribute to the gender disparity in AD, as evidenced by the 'estrogen hypothesis.' This posits that sex hormones, 17β-estradiol in particular, exert a neuroprotective effect by shielding females' brains from disease development. This theory is further supported by recent findings that the onset of menopause is associated with the emergence of AD-related brain changes in women in contrast to men of the same age. In this review, we discuss genetic, medical, societal, and lifestyle risk factors known to increase AD risk differently between the genders, with a focus on the role of hormonal changes, particularly declines in 17β-estradiol during the menopause transition (MT) as key underlying mechanisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Rahman, Jackson, Hristov, Isaacson, Saif, Shetty, Etingin, Henchcliffe, Brinton and Mosconi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The present study sought to determine if melatonin confers its beneficial effects by acting on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and attenuates the neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of aged mice. A total of 72 male C57BL/6 mice, 16-month-old, were randomly and equally divided into six groups: (1) the control group (CON); (2) the rapamycin group (RAP); (3) the melatonin group (MEL); (4) the isoflurane group (ISO); (5) the rapamycin + isoflurane group (RAP + ISO); and (6) the melatonin + isoflurane group (MEL + ISO). RAP, RAP + ISO, MEL, MEL + ISO groups received 1 mg/kg/day mTOR inhibitor rapamycin solution or 10 mg/kg/day melatonin solution, respectively, intraperitoneally at 5:00 p.m. for 14 days consecutively. Mice in the CON and ISO groups were administered an equivalent volume of saline. Subsequently, ISO, RAP + ISO, and MEL + ISO groups were exposed to inhale 2% isoflurane for 4 h; the CON, RAP, and MEL mice received only the vehicle gas. Then, the memory function and spatial learning of the mice were examined via the Morris water maze (MWM) test. mTOR expression was detected via Western blot, whereas the concentration of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and that of melatonin was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Melatonin and rapamycin significantly ameliorated the isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and also led to a decrease in the melatonin levels as well as the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and p-mTOR in the hippocampus. In conclusion, these results showed that melatonin and rapamycin attenuates mTOR expression while affecting the downstream proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, these molecular findings could be associated with an improved cognitive function in mice exposed to isoflurane.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Yuan, Wu, Zhai, Lu, Meng and Chen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Learning- and memory-related behavioral performance and the pathological processes involved were assessed using the Morris water maze test and immunostaining, respectively. We detected comprehensive expression of C1q, C3, microglia, and their regulatory cytokines in the hippocampus. After 7 days of LPS administration, we were able to observe LPS-induced learning and memory impairment in the mice, which was attributed to neural impairment and synapse loss in the hippocampus. We elucidated that the immune system was activated, with the classical complement pathway and microglial phagocytosis being involved in the synapse loss.

REEP1, a transmembrane protein belonging to TB2/HVA22 family, is implicated in SPG31, an autosomal dominant form of HSP, and its interaction with Atlastin/SPG3A and Spastin/SPG4, the other two major HSP linked proteins, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in modifying ER architecture. In addition, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of REEP1, named ReepA, has been found to regulate the response to ER neuronal stress. Herein we investigated the role of ReepA in ER morphology and stress response. ReepA is upregulated under stress conditions and aging. Our data show that ReepA triggers a selective activation of Ire1 and Atf6 branches of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and modifies ER morphology. <i>Drosophila</i> lacking ReepA showed Atf6 and Ire1 activation, expansion of ER sheet-like structures, locomotor dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Furthermore, we found that naringenin, a flavonoid that possesses strong antioxidant and neuroprotective activity, can rescue the cellular phenotypes, the lifespan and locomotor disability associated with ReepA loss of function. Our data highlight the importance of ER homeostasis in nervous system functionality and HSP neurodegenerative mechanisms, opening new opportunities for HSP treatment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Napoli, Gumeni, Forgiarini, Fantin, De Filippis, Panzeri, Vantaggiato and Orso.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In aging societies with high rates of male smoking such as in East Asia, smoking is a leading preventable risk factor for extending lives (including work-lives) and healthy aging. However, little is known about whether smoking interventions targeted at heavy smokers relative to light smokers lead to disproportionately larger improvements in life expectancy and prevalence of chronic diseases and how the effects vary across populations. Using a microsimulation model, we examined the health effects of smoking reduction by simulating an elimination of smoking among subgroups of smokers in South Korea, Singapore, and the United States. We found that life expectancy would increase by 0.2 to 1.5 years among light smokers and 2.5 to 3.7 years among heavy smokers. Whereas both interventions led to an increased life expectancy and decreased the prevalence of chronic diseases in all three countries, the life-extension benefits were greatest for those who would otherwise have been heavy smokers. Our findings illustrate how smoking interventions may have significant economic and social benefits, especially for life extension, that vary across countries.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Metallic nanomaterials are capable of mimicking all the three major antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase and oxidase, to control the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the cell as an alternative strategy over conventional one which has biological toxicity and have several adverse effects, if accumulation takes places during the treatment. This anti-oxidant property of metallic nanomaterials demonstrates as a promising candidate for its biomedical application in disease conditions where the excessive level of ROS causes damage to DNA, lipids and protein in several conditions such as diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Tribology is the study of interacting surfaces in motion and the measurement of properties such as friction, wear-tear and abrasion. While designing nano-scale biomedical devices, the consideration of tribology is particularly important because the high surface area ratio enhances problems with friction and wear-tear which can further affects its function as well as longevity.</AbstractText>"}

With aging, there is a natural decline in female fertility. The decrease in fertility is slow and steady in women aged 30-35 years; however, this decline is accelerated after the age of 35 due to decreases in the ovarian reserve and oocyte quality. Human oocyte aging is affected by different environmental factors, such as dietary habits and lifestyle. The ovarian microenvironment contributes to oocyte aging and longevity. The immediate oocyte microenvironment consists of the surrounding cells. Crosstalk between the oocyte and microenvironment is mediated by direct contact with surrounding cells, the extracellular matrix, and signalling molecules, including hormones, growth factors, and metabolic products. In this review, we highlight the different microenvironmental factors that accelerate human oocyte aging and decrease oocyte function. The ovarian microenvironment and the stress that is induced by environmental pollutants and a poor diet, along with other factors, impact oocyte quality and function and contribute to accelerated oocyte aging and diseases of infertility.</AbstractText>"}

This cohort study aimed to evaluate the risk of BZDs and z-hypnotics for subsequent dementia development with a special consideration of their half-lives and the concomitant use of these medications. People aged 65 years and older who were newly prescribed oral BZDs or z-hypnotics between 2003 and 2012 were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. All BZDs were categorized as long-acting drugs (≥ 20 h) or short-acting drugs (&lt; 20 h) for further comparisons, and data were collected on a quarterly basis, starting on the first date of drug prescription and ending on the date of death, occurrence of dementia, or end of the follow-up period (December 31, 2012), whichever came first. All dementia events except vascular dementia occurring during the follow-up period were identified. Among 260,502 eligible subjects, short-acting BZDs and z-hypnotics users were at greater risk of dementia than long-acting users [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) in short-acting BZD users, 1.98 (1.89-2.07); z-hypnotic users, 1.79 (1.68-1.91); and long-acting BZD users, 1.47 (1.37-1.58)]. In addition, subjects concomitantly using 2 or more BZDs or z-hypnotics had a higher risk of dementia than those who used 1 of these drugs (4.79 (3.95-5.81)). The use of BZDs and z-hypnotics was strongly associated with the risk of dementia development, especially the short-acting BZDs, z-hypnotics, and concomitant use of multiple agents.

And it is now clear that the mitochondrial energy metabolism is important for stem cell differentiation. When stem cells commit to differentiate, glycolytic metabolism is being shifted to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to meet an increased cellular energy demand required for differentiated cells. However, the nature of cellular metabolisms during the differentiation process of periosteum-derived mesenchymal stem cells (POMSC) is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated mitochondrial biogenesis during the adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation of POMSCs. Both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents and mitochondrial proteins (VDAC and mitochondrial OXPHOS complex subunits) were increased during all of these mesenchymal lineage differentiations of POMSCs. Interestingly, glycolytic metabolism is reduced as POMSCs undergo osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, reducing mtDNA contents by ethidium bromide treatments prevents osteogenic differentiation of POMSCs. In conclusion, these results indicate that mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS metabolism play important roles in the differentiation of POMCS and suggest that pharmaceutical modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function can be a novel regulation for POMSC differentiation and regenerative medicine.</AbstractText>"}

Decontamination studies among ICU patients reporting CNS bacteremia incidence data were obtained mostly from recent systematic reviews.

The human microbiome is composed of bacteria (bacteriome), archaea (archaeome), fungi (mycobiome), and viruses (virome). To date, research has mainly been centered on the composition of the bacteriome, with other members remain poorly studied.

Clarification of how delirium may cause cognitive decline, perhaps through evidence of contemporaneous neuronal injury, would enhance plausibility for a causal relationship. Dose-dependence of neuronal injury with delirium severity would further enhance the biological plausibility for this relationship. We tested whether delirium is associated with neuronal injury in 114 surgical patients recruited to a prospective biomarker cohort study. Patients underwent perioperative testing for changes in neurofilament light, a neuronal injury biomarker, as well as a panel of 10 cytokines, with contemporaneous assessment of delirium severity and incidence. A subset of patients underwent preoperative MRI. Initially we confirmed prior reports that neurofilament light levels correlated with markers of neurodegeneration [hippocampal volume (ΔR2 = 0.129, P = 0.015)] and white matter changes including fractional anisotropy of white matter (ΔR2 = 0.417, P &lt; 0.001) with similar effects on mean, axial and radial diffusivity) in our cohort and that surgery was associated with increasing neurofilament light from preoperative levels [mean difference (95% confidence interval, CI) = 0.240 (0.178, 0.301) log10 (pg/ml), P &lt; 0.001], suggesting putative neuronal injury. Next, we tested the relationship with delirium. Neurofilament light rose more sharply in participants with delirium compared to non-sufferers [mean difference (95% CI) = 0.251 (0.136, 0.367) log10 (pg/ml), P &lt; 0.001]. This relationship showed dose-dependence, such that neurofilament light rose proportionately to delirium severity (ΔR2 = 0.199, P &lt; 0.001). Given that inflammation is considered an important driver of postoperative delirium, next we tested whether neurofilament light, as a potential marker of neurotoxicity, may contribute to the pathogenesis of delirium independent of inflammation. From a panel of 10 cytokines, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 exhibited a strong correlation with delirium severity (ΔR2 = 0.208, P &lt; 0.001). Therefore, we tested whether the change in neurofilament light contributed to delirium severity independent of IL-8. Neurofilament light was independently associated with delirium severity after adjusting for the change in inflammation (ΔR2 = 0.040, P = 0.038). These data suggest delirium is associated with exaggerated increases in neurofilament light and that this putative neurotoxicity may contribute to the pathogenesis of delirium itself, independent of changes in inflammation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

Here we show that a transient increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occurs naturally during early development in a subpopulation of synchronized Caenorhabditis elegans, sets processes in motion that increase stress resistance, improve redox homeostasis and ultimately prolong lifespan in those animals. We find that these effects are linked to the global ROS-mediated decrease in developmental histone H3K4me3 levels. Studies in HeLa cells confirmed that global H3K4me3 levels are ROS-sensitive and that depletion of H3K4me3 levels increases stress resistance in mammalian cell cultures. In vitro studies identified SET1/MLL histone methyltransferases as redox sensitive units of the H3K4-trimethylating complex of proteins (COMPASS).

A genetic translocation that elevates sKL levels in humans is paradoxically associated with increased circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels and the potential of both membrane KL (mKL135) and sKL130 to act as coreceptors for FGF23 activation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). Neither FGF23 expression nor the contributions of FGF23, mKL135, and sKL130 codependent and independent functions have been investigated in KlTg mice. In the current study, we examined the effects of Kl overexpression on FGF23 levels and functions in KlTg mice. We found that mKL135 but not sKL130 stimulated FGF23 expression in osteoblasts, leading to elevated Fgf23 bone expression and circulating levels in KlTg mice. Elevated FGF23 suppressed 1,25(OH)2D and parathyroid hormone levels but did not cause hypophosphatemic rickets in KlTg mice. KlTg mice developed low aldosterone-associated hypertension but not left ventricular hypertrophy. Mechanistically, we found that mKL135 and sKL130 are essential cofactors for FGF23-mediated ERK activation but that they inhibited FGF23 stimulation of PLC-γ and PI3K/AKT signaling. Thus, increased longevity in KlTg mice occurs in the presence of excess FGF23 that interacts with mKL and sKL to bias FGFR pathways.</AbstractText>"}

However, the mechanisms underlying the transition from a young-and-healthy to aged-and-dysfunctional brain are not well understood. Here, we report breakdown of the vascular blood-brain barrier (BBB) in aging humans and rodents, which begins as early as middle age and progresses to the end of the life span. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function manipulations show that this BBB dysfunction triggers hyperactivation of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in astrocytes, which is necessary and sufficient to cause neural dysfunction and age-related pathology in rodents. Specifically, infusion of the serum protein albumin into the young rodent brain (mimicking BBB leakiness) induced astrocytic TGFβ signaling and an aged brain phenotype including aberrant electrocorticographic activity, vulnerability to seizures, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, conditional genetic knockdown of astrocytic TGFβ receptors or pharmacological inhibition of TGFβ signaling reversed these symptomatic outcomes in aged mice. Last, we found that this same signaling pathway is activated in aging human subjects with BBB dysfunction. Our study identifies dysfunction in the neurovascular unit as one of the earliest triggers of neurological aging and demonstrates that the aging brain may retain considerable latent capacity, which can be revitalized by therapeutic inhibition of TGFβ signaling.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In approximately one in seven infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy, ZIKV has been linked to microcephaly, developmental delays, or other congenital disorders collectively known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) as well as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in ZIKV infected adults. It is a global health priority to develop a vaccine against ZIKV that elicits long-lasting immunity; however, the durability of immunity to ZIKV is unknown. Previous studies in mice and nonhuman primates have been crucial in vaccine development but have not defined the duration of immunity generated by ZIKV infection. In this study, we rechallenged five rhesus macaques with ZIKV 22 to 28 months after a primary ZIKV infection. We show that primary ZIKV infection generates high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that protect from detectable plasma viremia following rechallenge and persist for at least 22 to 28 months. While additional longitudinal studies are necessary with longer time frames, this study establishes a new experimentally defined minimal length of protective ZIKV immunity.<b>Importance</b> ZIKV emerged as a vector-borne pathogen capable of causing illness in infected adults and congenital birth defects in infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy. Despite the drop in ZIKV cases since the 2015-16 epidemic, questions concerning the prevalence and longevity of protective immunity have left vulnerable communities fearful that they may become the center of next ZIKV outbreak. While pre-existing herd immunity in regions of past outbreaks may dampen the potential for future outbreaks to occur, we currently do not know the longevity of protective immunity to ZIKV after a person becomes infected. Here, we establish a new experimentally defined minimal length of protective ZIKV immunity. We show that five rhesus macaques initially infected with ZIKV 22 to 28 months prior to rechallenge elicit a durable immune response that protected from detectable plasma viremia.

Accordingly, there is a need for reliable biomarkers to distinguish between normal aging and incipient AD. Recent research suggests that, in addition to established biomarkers such as CSF Aß42, total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau, resting state connectivity established by fMRI might also be a feasible biomarker for prodromal stages of AD. In order to explore this possibility, we investigated resting state functional connectivity as well as CSF biomarker profiles in patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 30; age 66.43 ± 7.06 years) and cognitively healthy controls (n = 38; age 66.89 ± 7.12 years). CSF Aß42, total Tau and hyperphosphorylated tau concentrations were correlated with measures of cognitive performance (immediate and delayed recall, global cognition, processing speed). Moreover, MCI related alterations in intrinsic functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) were investigated using functional resting state MRI (rs-fMRI). As expected, MCI patients showed decreased CSF Aß42 and increased total Tau concentrations. These alterations were associated with cognitive performance. However, there were no differences between MCI patients and cognitively healthy controls regarding intrinsic functional connectivity. In conclusion, our results indicate, that CSF protein profiles seem to be more closely related to cognitive decline than alterations in resting state activity. Thus, resting state connectivity might not be a reliable biomarker for early stages of AD.</AbstractText>"}

However, implant complications may occur in more challenging situations, bone cell senescence and osteoporosis (OP). Due to certain microenvironment conditions, including hormonal, nutritional, and aging factors, the bone cell responses are regulated to alteration and end into cell senescence and OP. Thus, the bone tissue regeneration is limited with site morbidity increased, leading to bone graft failure. In such pathological state, bone grafts and substitutes are companied with OP therapies to improve bone tissue engineering and to enhance bone graft healing. Those substitutes with OP therapeutic-based applications have been becoming a growing field of interest in bone repair. Bone grafts, such as scaffolds with antiosteoporotic drugs releasing and implants with surface therapeutic modified, are studied to significantly increase low bone density as well as improve impaired bone regeneration. In this review, we discuss a thorough understanding in bone remodeling process, bone cell senescence, and mechanisms of OA and OP. Based on the understanding, the review concentrates on the treatments to the OP and the bone grafts applied in the bone senescence model and provides a future direction in clinical trial. Impact Statement This review discusses the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies for aging-related bone diseases, which have been highly concerned in aging society. These therapies can improve the efficacy of bone tissue regeneration, enhance the quality of bone repair, and provide new insights in the field of bone clinical treatments and aging regeneration.</AbstractText>"}

However, the potential role of RAS in adult neurogenesis in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and its aging-related alterations have not been investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the role of major RAS receptors on neurogenesis in the V-SVZ of adult mice and rats. In mice, we showed that the increase in proliferation of cells in this neurogenic niche was induced by activation of AT2 receptors but depended partially on the AT2-dependent antagonism of AT1 receptor expression, which restricted proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a functional dependence of AT2 receptor actions on Mas receptors. In rats, where the levels of the AT1 relative to those of AT2 receptor are much lower, pharmacological inhibition of the AT1 receptor alone was sufficient in increasing AT2 receptor levels and proliferation in the V-SVZ. Our data revealed that interactions between RAS receptors play a major role in the regulation of V-SVZ neurogenesis, particularly in proliferation, generation of neuroblasts, and migration to the olfactory bulb, both in young and aged brains, and suggest potential beneficial effects of RAS modulators on neurogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Ninety ROIs from the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas were selected for functional connectivity analysis. A correlation matrix was created for each group, and a third matrix with the correlation coefficient differences between the two matrices was created. Functional segregation was analyzed with the 3-cycle method, which is novel in studies of this topic. Finally, cluster analyses were also performed. Our results showed that the two correlation matrices were visually similar but had many differences related to different cognitive functions. Differences were especially apparent in the anterior default mode network (DMN), while the visual resting-state network (RSN) showed no differences between groups. Differences in connectivity patterns in the anterior DMN should be studied more extensively to fully understand its role in the differentiation of healthy aging and an MCI diagnosis.</AbstractText>"}

However, its role in cortical neuronal survival at different post-ischemic phases remains unclear. The current study found that IL-10 had distinct effects on the neuronal apoptosis at different OGD stages: at an early stage after OGD, IL-10 promoted the OGD-induced neuronal apoptosis in the cultured primary cortical neurons by activating p65 subunit, which up-regulated Bax expression and down-regulated Bcl-xL expression; at a late OGD stage, however, it attenuated the OGD-induced neuronal apoptosis by activating c-Rel, which up-regulated Bcl-xL expression and down-regulated Bax expression. The early-stage pro-apoptosis and late-stage anti-apoptosis were both partly abolished by PDTC, an NF-κB inhibitor, and promoted by PMA, an NF-κB activator. The optimal anti-apoptotic effect appeared when the cultured neurons were treated with IL-10 at 9-24 h after OGD. Taken together, our findings suggest that IL-10 exerts a dual effect on the survival of the cultured neurons by activating the NF-κB pathway at different stages after OGD injury and that PMA treatment at a late stage can facilitate the IL-10-conferred neuroprotection against OGD-induced neuronal injury.</AbstractText>"}

We then showed that dietary intake of β-1,3-glucans induced a significant increase in T helper cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>) in young, middle-aged and aged male mice. We also showed that β-1,3-glucans supplementation considerably increased the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, a T cell-mediated immune response, in young and aged mice.

Despite significant effort, the molecular basis for metformin response remains poorly understood, with a limited number of specific biochemical pathways studied to date. To broaden our understanding of hepatic metformin response, we combine phospho-protein enrichment in tissue from genetically engineered mice with a quantitative proteomics platform to enable the discovery and quantification of basophilic kinase substrates in vivo. We define proteins whose binding to 14-3-3 are acutely regulated by metformin treatment and/or loss of the serine/threonine kinase, LKB1. Inducible binding of 250 proteins following metformin treatment is observed, 44% of which proteins bind in a manner requiring LKB1. Beyond AMPK, metformin activates protein kinase D and MAPKAPK2 in an LKB1-independent manner, revealing additional kinases that may mediate aspects of metformin response.

Ninety-six intact extracted human maxillary third molars were assigned to two groups (n=48) based on occlusal, buccal cusps only and all cusps reduction. The groups were divided into two subgroups: pin retained and non-pin retained build-ups resulting in four groups (n=24), according the cusps reduction: pin retained/partial, pin retained/complete, non-pin retained/partial, non-pin retained/complete. Occlusal reduction was 3 mm with a semi-lunar retentive shoulder of 3 mm and an axial wall height of 1.5 mm. Groups were restored using a microhybrid, flowable or titanium reinforced resin composite. Modified self-curing acrylic resin provisional crowns were fabricated, cemented with non-eugenol temporary cement and thermal cycled. An instron machine applied tension to the provisional crowns parallel to the long axis of the tooth until dislodgement. A three-way analysis of variance was conducted on the influence of the variables on the retention of the core build-up. Ninety-three build-ups were retained under tensile load, while three core build-ups without pins were dislodged. Three-way analysis of variance showed no statistically significant difference between core build-ups using a retentive shoulder and pin retained core build-ups when tested under tensile load. With the advent of adhesive systems, increased surface area and retentive shoulder design can provide a retentive core foundation to prevent early failures of core build-ups during indirect restoration fabrication which will contribute to the longevity of final restorations.</AbstractText>"}

Ach., a traditional Chinese medicine, of which the anti-aging effect has been discovered. Their protective performance against skin aging was assayed by co-culturing with skin cells in this work. Results showed that β-sitosterol promoted the biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid by increasing the expression of hyaluronic acid synthases in fibroblasts and enhanced the expression of skin barrier functional proteins including aquaporin 3, loricrin, filaggrin and involucrin in keratinocytes, which conduced to the moisture retention within skin. Moreover, vermicularin might function as an anti-wrinkle agent by preventing the loss of collagen type I. Specifically, vermicularin reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species within hydrogen-peroxide-induced fibroblasts; together with suppressing the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, it could inhibit the production of matrix metalloproteinases-1. The present research will contribute to the development of the compounds as anti-aging ingredients for future applications in cosmetic formulations and functional food as well as promote further studies of raw materials containing alike compounds.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated whether long-term exposure to airborne hydrocarbons, including volatile organic compounds, increased IS risk. This retrospective cohort study included 283,666 people aged 40 years or older in Taiwan. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to fit single- and multiple-pollutant models for two targeted pollutants, total hydrocarbons (THC) and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and estimated the risk of IS. Before controlling for multiple pollutants, hazard ratios (HRs) of IS with 95% confidence intervals for the overall population were 2.69 (2.64-2.74) at 0.16-ppm increase in THC and 1.62 (1.59-1.66) at 0.11-ppm increase in NMHC. For the multiple-pollutant models controlling for PM2.5, the adjusted HR was 3.64 (3.56-3.72) for THC and 2.21 (2.16-2.26) for NMHC.

The infection potential closely relates to the fecal source type and the aging persistence of waterborne pathogens. In this study, the health risk of contracting gastroenteritis from exposure to aging fecal contamination was predicted using source-associated markers. Microbial decay characteristics in typical summer seawater were incorporated into a pathogen dose estimation model for a constant fecal input. Results show that the median illness probability commensurate with the health benchmark of 36/1000 corresponded to the marker concentrations of ∼7.8, ∼6.6, ∼3.7, and ∼3.5 log<sub>10</sub> gene copies/100 mL for seagulls, cattle, raw sewage, and treated effluent, respectively. The error in risk estimates due to neglecting microbial decay was linearly correlated to the decay differences between markers and pathogens. Specifically, the health risk associated with nonhuman sources, which was primarily contributed by bacterial and parasitic pathogens, can be substantially overestimated, while that for virus-dominated human sources was insignificantly affected by the differential decay. Additionally, seagulls dominated the <i>Enterococcus</i> concentration in waters with a mixture of the above-mentioned sources, although they posed limited health risk. This study provides an approach to understanding the influence of fecal aging on health risk estimation.</AbstractText>"}

Although patients with AD are known to have abnormal circadian rhythms and suffer sleep disturbances, the role of the molecular clock in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology is still poorly understood. Here, we explored how the circadian repressors REV-ERBα and β affected Aβ clearance in mouse microglia. We discovered that, at Circadian time 4 (CT4), microglia expressed higher levels of the master clock protein BMAL1 and more rapidly phagocytosed fibrillary Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (fAβ<sub>1-42</sub> ) than at CT12. BMAL1 directly drives transcription of REV-ERB proteins, which are implicated in microglial activation. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBs with the small molecule antagonist SR8278 or genetic knockdown of REV-ERBs-accelerated microglial uptake of fAβ<sub>1-42</sub> and increased transcription of BMAL1. SR8278 also promoted microglia polarization toward a phagocytic M2-like phenotype with increased P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor expression. Finally, constitutive deletion of Rev-erbα in the 5XFAD model of AD decreased amyloid plaque number and size and prevented plaque-associated increases in disease-associated microglia markers including TREM2, CD45, and Clec7a. Altogether, our work suggests a novel strategy for controlling Aβ clearance and neuroinflammation by targeting REV-ERBs and provides new insights into the role of REV-ERBs in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

With an increasing prevalence of obesity among older adults in Ghana, it has become necessary to develop cost-effective strategies for its management and prevention. However, developing such strategies is challenging as body mass index (BMI)-specific utilization and costs required for cost-effectiveness analysis are not available in this population. Therefore, this study examines the associations between health services utilization as well as direct healthcare costs and overweight (BMI ≥25.00 and &lt;30.00 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥30.00 kg/m2) among older adults in Ghana. Data were used from a nationally representative, multistage sample of 3350 people aged 50+ years from the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (WHO-SAGE; 2014/15). Health service utilization was measured by the number of health facility visits over a 12-month period. Direct costs (2017 US dollars) included out-of-pocket payments and the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) claims. Associations between utilization and BMI were examined using multivariable zero-inflated negative binomial regressions; and between costs and BMI using multivariable two-part regressions. Twenty-three percent were overweight and 13% were obese. Compared with normal-weight participants, overweight and obesity were associated with 75% and 159% more inpatient admissions, respectively. Obesity was also associated with 53% additional outpatient visits. One in five of the overweight and obese population had at least one chronic disease, and having chronic disease was associated with increased outpatient utilization. The average per person total costs for overweight was $78 and obesity was $132 compared with $35 for normal weight. The NHIS bore approximately 60% of the average total costs per person expended in 2014/15. Overweight and obese groups had significantly higher total direct healthcare costs burden of $121 million compared with $64 million for normal weight in the entire older adult Ghanaian population. Compared with normal weight, the total costs per person associated with overweight increased by 73% and more than doubled for obesity. Even though the total prevalence of overweight and obesity was about half of that of normal weight, the sum of their cost burden was almost doubled. Implementing weight reduction measures could reduce health service utilization and costs in this population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the structural data, which show learning-induced and long-lasting remodeling of synapses, are still very sparse. Here, we reconstruct 1927 dendritic spines and their postsynaptic densities (PSDs), representing a postsynaptic part of the glutamatergic synapse, in the hippocampal area CA1 of the mice that underwent spatial training. We observe that in young adult (5 months), mice volume of PSDs, but not the volume of the spines, is increased 26 h after the training. The training-induced growth of PSDs is specific for the dendritic spines that lack smooth endoplasmic reticulum and spine apparatuses, and requires autophosphorylation of αCaMKII. Interestingly, aging alters training-induced ultrastructural remodeling of dendritic spines. In old mice, both the median volumes of dendritic spines and PSDs shift after training toward bigger values. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that formation of memory leaves long-lasting footprint on the ultrastructure of brain circuits; however, the form of circuit remodeling changes with age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In a population-based sample of 337 older participants aged 61-82 years (Mage = 69.66, SDage = 3.92 years), we modeled the independent and joint effects of limbic WM microstructure and HC subfield volumes on verbal learning. Participants completed a verbal learning task of recall over five repeated trials and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural and diffusion scans. We segmented three HC subregions on high-resolution MRI data and sampled mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from bilateral limbic WM tracts identified via deterministic fiber tractography. Using structural equation modeling, we evaluated the associations between learning rate and latent factors representing FA sampled from limbic WM tracts, and HC subfield volumes, and their latent interaction. Results showed limbic WM and the interaction of HC and WM-but not HC volume alone-predicted verbal learning rates. Model decomposition revealed HC volume is only positively associated with learning rate in individuals with higher WM anisotropy. We conclude that the structural characteristics of limbic WM regions and HC volume jointly contribute to verbal learning in older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The perception of the aging-induced recovery process and refutation of the raised stability issues are required for commercial application of Ag electrodes. Herein, we compared the aging effect of PSCs with Ag and Au electrodes and found that only devices with Ag electrodes have a dramatical aging-induced recovery process. We observed the change of photoelectronic properties only in the devices with Ag electrodes as time passes, which mainly contributes to recovery of the s-shaped <i>J</i>-<i>V</i> curve. We verified the work function change of an aged Ag electrode and its mechanism by photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. By comparing the light stability under 1 sun intensity illumination, we can assure the practical stability of Ag electrodes in case of being encapsulated.

Telomeric length is primarily regulated by the telomerase complex, essentially consisting of an RNA template (TERC), an enzymatic subunit (telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT). In humans, telomerase activity is repressed during embryonic differentiation and is absent in most somatic cells. However, it is upregulated or reactivated in 80%-90% of the primary tumours in humans. The human TERT (hTERT) plays a pivotal role in cellular immortality and tumourigenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of telomerase functioning in cancer have not been fully understood beyond the telomere maintenance. Several research groups, including ours, have demonstrated that hTERT possesses vital functions independent of its telomere maintenance, including angiogenesis, inflammation, cancer cell stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). All these telomere-independent activities of hTERT may contribute to the regulation of the dynamics and homeostasis of the tumour microenvironment (TME), thereby promoting tumour growth and development. Cancer progression and metastasis largely depend upon the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. In this review, the involvement of TERT in the tumour microenvironment and the underlying implications in cancer therapeutics have been summarized.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, it remains unclear whether the presence of tauopathy is the only requirement for initiating the BF degeneration in asymptomatic subjects at risk for AD (AR-AD), and how BF structural deficits evolve from normal aging to preclinical and prodromal AD. Here, we provide human in vivo magnetic resonance imaging evidence supporting that abnormal cerebrospinal fluid levels of phosphorylated tau (T+) are selectively associated with bilateral volume loss of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM, Ch4) in AR-AD individuals. Spreading of atrophy to medial septum and vertical limb of diagonal band Broca (Ch1-Ch2) occurred in both preclinical and prodromal AD. With the exception of A+, all groups revealed significant correlations between volume reduction of BF cholinergic compartments and atrophy of their innervated regions.

Our previous study indicated that hypotaurine levels are associated with the ageing of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). However, whether hypotaurine plays a role in the lifespan regulation of C. elegans and the mechanism remains undetermined. Here, we found that hypotaurine enhances oxidative stress resistance and ameliorates ageing in C. elegans. Our results show that hypotaurine regulates a variety of pathways and leads to the upregulation of some age-related genes to extend lifespan. We also found that the stress response-related transcription factors DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 contribute to the beneficial longevity conferred by hypotaurine. Moreover, our results demonstrate that hypotaurine induced lifespan extension by regulating the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, the reproductive signaling pathway and DR-like mechanisms. Additionally, our results also indicated that mitochondrial function also plays a crucial role in the lifespan extension induced by hypotaurine. Taken together, these data indicate that hypotaurine delays the ageing of C. elegans, due, at least in part, to its antioxidant activity, which in turn regulates IIS, and reproductive and DR-related pathways, thereby inducing the activity of the transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1.</AbstractText>"}

This study was conducted to determine if new engine oils and their used versions have the potential to induce dermal irritation. Twelve male New Zealand White rabbits (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>, 19 weeks old) were used to determine the acute dermal toxicity potential of four aircraft turbine oils including MIL-PRF-7808 Grades 3 and 4 and MIL-PRF-23699 Grade 5 High Thermal Stability (HTS) and a Grade 5 experimental aircraft engine oil in their unused and used or laboratory stressed states. Five fur-free test sites (6 cm<sup>2</sup> each) located lateral to the midline of the back were treated with two undiluted (0.5 ml) new engine oils and their used versions. The fifth site received reverse osmosis deionized (RODI) water as a control. Each treatment was repeated 3 times (3 rabbits/oil type). Each oil was tested under both semi-occluded and occluded conditions. The 4 h exposure was followed by gauze plus wrappings removal, and gentle cleaning of sites prior to scoring for erythema and edema at 0.5-1, 24, 48 and 72 h post exposure based on Draize (1959). E-collars were placed on each animal for at least 72 h to prevent ingestion of the test substance and/or gauze and wrappings and/or disturbance of site recovery. Additional observations were made on days 7, 10 and 14 to determine recovery. Exposure to both used and new oils produced dermal irritation consisting of no more than very slight to well-defined erythema and very slight edema. The calculated Primary Dermal Irritation Index (PDII) indicated that all the oils were slightly irritating (means ranged from 0.42 to 1.08). Although the PDII values for new oils and their used versions were not significantly different from each other, they were all statistically higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those obtained for the control regardless of the type of occlusion binding applied. The used oils under semi-occlusion conditions yielded larger size effects (Cohen's d) relative to their unused versions suggesting an enhancement in irritation when the oil is aging. Grade 4 in the used state yielded the largest size effect which was d = 5.9 versus 2.6 for its unused version. The slight dermal irritation resulting from four hours of exposure to oils raises concerns about the magnitude of impact related to prolonged and/or repeated exposure.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Access to quality outpatient care and disease management programs has been shown to improve disease treatment and prognosis. Rural populations face unique challenges in the availability and accessibility of quality cardiovascular care. In 2018, we conducted a pooled cross-sectional analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2009-2014 to examine recent trends in CHF-related hospital deaths in the United States, highlighting urban-rural differences within each census region. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to compare the odds of CHF-related hospital death<i>,</i> by levels of rurality and within each census region. Most CHF-related hospital deaths occurred in the South and Midwest census regions and in large central metropolitan areas. Findings from census region stratified models revealed that non-core residents living within the West (OR 1.47, CI 1.26, 1.71), Midwest (OR 1.30, CI 1.17, 1.44), and South (OR = 1.21, 95% C.I. = 1.12-1.32) had a higher relative risk (but not higher absolute numbers) of experiencing death during a CHF-related hospitalization, compared to patients in large central metropolitan areas. Within each census region, there were also differences in odds of a CHF-related hospital death depending on patient sex, comorbidities, insurance type, median annual income, and year. As efforts to reduce rural health disparities in CHF morbidity continue, more work is needed to understand and test interventions to reduce the risk of death from CHF in noncore areas of the West, Midwest, and South.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Any impairments in oocyte mitochondrial function have negative effects on the reproduction and pregnancy outcome. It has been stated that infertility problems caused by poor quality oocytes in women with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and repeated pregnancy failures are associated with aging and could be overcome by transferring large amounts of healthy mitochondria. Hence, researches on biology, disease, and the therapeutic use of mitochondria continue to introduce some clinical approaches such as autologous mitochondrial transfer techniques. Following mitochondrial transfer, the amount of ATP required for aged-oocyte during fertilization, blastocyst formation, and subsequent embryonic development could be an alternative modality. These modulations improve the pregnancy outcome in women of high reproductive aging as well. In addition to overview the clinical studies using mitochondrial microinjection, this study provides a framework for future approaches to develop effective treatments and preventions of congenital transmission of mitochondrial DNA mutations/diseases to offspring. Mitochondrial transfer from ovarian cells and healthy oocytes could lead to improved fertility outcome in low-quality oocytes. The modulation of mitochondrial bioactivity seems to regulate basal metabolism inside target oocytes and thereby potentiate physiological activity of these cells while overcoming age-related infertility in female germ cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were completed with a subsample of participants (<i>n</i> = 42). Results highlight participation in a variety of activities across the decades of older adulthood, and identify that engagement in productive and active leisure pursuits decreased in frequency with increasing age, while the frequency of social and passive leisure activities remained stable. Changes in engagement were a function of five themes derived from the fundamental qualitative description: (a) health and physical limitations, (b) death, (c) freedom, (d) desire, and (e) external influential factors. Patterns of engagement frequency are interpreted in consideration of qualitative findings, creating an integrated discussion of 'how' and 'why' activity profiles emerge during older adulthood.

This classification has important flaws: (i) From an epigenetic standpoint, such a polar classification could lead to misconceptions since both factors are interdependent through lifelong interactions. (ii) There are no specifications regarding these 'environmental' factors, which include a broad heterogeneity of conditions (physical, economic, social, and cultural aspects as well as behavioral ones such as lifestyle) but do not include personal conditions, such as psychological characteristics. The review of the new paradigm called successful aging yields an important set of psycho-behavioral factors, and although population indexes such as Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) or Healthy Life expectancy (HLE) have been developed, authors do not take into consideration healthy or successful longevity as a potential prolongation of the new paradigm of active or successful aging.

Given that non-verbal communication contains both emotional and non-emotional, conversational expressions and that input to the brain is usually dynamic, here we address the question of potential facial expression processing differences in a novel format: we test a range of conversational and emotional, dynamic facial expressions in three groups - PD patients (<i>n</i> = 20), age- and education-matched older healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 20), and younger adult healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 20). This setup allows us to address both effects of PD and age-related differences. We employed a rating task for all groups in which 12 rating dimensions were used to assess evaluative processing of 27 expression videos from six different actors. We found that ratings overall were consistent across groups with several rating dimensions (such as arousal or outgoingness) having a strong correlation with the expressions' motion energy content as measured by optic flow analysis. Most importantly, we found that the PD group did not differ in any rating dimension from the older healthy control group (HCG), indicating highly similar evaluation processing. Both older groups, however, did show significant differences for several rating scales in comparison with the younger adults HCG. Looking more closely, older participants rated negative expressions compared to the younger participants as more positive, but also as less natural, persuasive, empathic, and sincere. We interpret these findings in the context of the positivity effect and in-group processing advantages. Overall, our findings do not support strong processing deficits due to PD, but rather point to age-related differences in facial expression processing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Derya, Kang, Kwon and Wallraven.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Previous studies found that older adults have difficulty comprehending sentences with long-distance dependency relations. However, it is not clear whether they are more disrupted by longer structural distance between gaps and fillers, or longer linear distance. There is a distinction between linear distance and structural distance, in that the former is directly related to working memory whereas the latter is associated with syntactic ability. By examining the effect of linear distance and structural distance on sentence processing by older adults, we can identify whether age-related decline in sentence comprehension is attributed to working memory dysfunction or syntactic decline. For this purpose, structural distance and linear distance were manipulated in Mandarin relative clauses (RCs). 30 older adults and 33 younger adults were instructed to perform a self-paced reading task. We found that both groups performed more slowly as structural distance increased, and less accurately when linear distance increased. More importantly, there was a significant interaction between linear distance and age group in the accuracy of comprehension, with linear distance disrupting older adults more than younger adults in offline processing. The findings suggest that the age-related decline in offline sentence comprehension might be attributable to the decline in working memory, rather than syntactic ability. Practical implications, limitations, and directions for future studies are discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Liu and Wang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We explored the influence of cognitive, social, and physical lifestyle factors on resting-state lagged linear connectivity (LLC) in high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in adults, ages 35-75 years. Diverse lifestyle factors build cognitive reserve (CR), protecting cognition in the presence of physical brain decline. Differences in LLC were examined between high- and low-CR groups formed using cognitive, social, and exercise lifestyle factors. LLC is a measure of lagged coherence that excludes zero phase contributions and limits the effects of volume conduction on connectivity estimates. Significant differences in LLC were identified for cognitive and social factors, but not exercise. Participants high in social CR possessed greater local and long-range connectivity in theta and low alpha for eyes-open and eyes-closed recording conditions. In contrast, participants high in cognitive CR exhibited greater eyes-closed long-range connectivity between the occipital lobe and other cortical regions in low alpha. Greater eyes-closed local LLC in delta was also present in men high in cognitive CR. Cognitive factor scores correlated with sustained attention, whereas social factors scores correlated with spatial working memory. Gender was a significant covariate in our analyses, with women displaying higher local and long-range LLC in low beta. Our findings support distinct relationships between CR and LLC, as well as CR and cognitive function for cognitive and social subcomponents.

Altered functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode network (DMN) is regarded as a hallmark of AD. Furthermore, the DMN can be divided into two subnetworks, the anterior and posterior subnetworks. However, little is known about distinct disruptive patterns in the subsystems of the DMN across the preclinical AD spectrum. This study investigated the connectivity patterns of anterior DMN (aDMN) and posterior DMN (pDMN) across the preclinical AD spectrum. <b>Methods</b>: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to investigate the FC in the DMN subnetworks in 20 healthy controls (HC), eight SCD, 11 naMCI, and 28 aMCI patients. Moreover, a correlation analysis was used to examine associations between the altered connectivity of the DMN subnetworks and the neurocognitive performance. <b>Results</b>: Compared to the HC, SCD patients showed increased FC in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), naMCI patients showed increased FC in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and aMCI patients showed increased FC in the bilateral IPL in the aDMN; while SCD patients showed decreased FC in the precuneus, naMCI patients showed increased FC in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and aMCI patients also showed increased FC in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in the pDMN. Notably, the FC between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the left MFG and the IPL in the aDMN was associated with episodic memory in the SCD and aMCI groups. Interestingly, the FC between the posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and several regions in the pDMN was associated with other cognitive functions in the SCD and naMCI groups. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study demonstrates that the three preclinical stages of AD exhibit distinct FC alternations in the DMN subnetworks. Furthermore, the patient group data showed that the altered FC involves cognitive function. These findings can provide novel insights for tailored clinical intervention across the preclinical AD spectrum.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Xue, Yuan, Yue, Xu, Wang, Wu, Ji, Zhou, Zhao, Rao, Yang, Xiao and Chen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Cell-to-cell genomic differences, which are the result of somatic mutations during development and aging, contribute to cellular diversity in the nervous system. This genomic diversity has important implications for nervous system development, function, and disease. Brain somatic mosaicism might contribute to individualized behavioral phenotypes and has been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, understanding the causes and consequences of somatic mosaicism in neural circuits is of great interest. Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have provided new means to study human organ development and various human pathologies <i>in vitro</i>. Cerebral organoids ('mini-brains') are pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D culture systems that recapitulate, to some extent, the developmental processes and organization of the developing human brain. Here, I discuss the application of these neural organoids for modeling brain somatic mosaicism in a lab dish. Special emphasis is given to the potential role of microglial mutations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Verheijen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The technologies can significantly facilitate the daily lives of an ageing population. In Austria, in wave 6 in 2015, an additional paper-and-pencil questionnaire was implemented which asked details about attitudes towards different technological innovations. From these questions, we develop a binary attitude score which indicates positive attitudes towards new technologies. In probit estimations, the attitude score is related to different demographic and health variables. Our main results indicate that strong gender differences in attitudes towards new technologies exist: men value communication and entertainment devices more, whereas women's attitudes are more positive towards devices that include a specific health or support value. Furthermore, while older cohorts value entertainment devices less than younger ones, no such pattern exists for health and support systems.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Linear mixed-effect models revealed that engaging in midlife PA of moderate or heavy intensity was associated with significantly less-pronounced decline of <i>z</i>-scores in all cognitive domains. Similarly, participants that engaged in late-life moderate or heavy PA had less decline in visuospatial, attention and global <i>z</i>-scores than non-active peers.

Three groups of 23 aging adults, aged 60-80 years, were recruited for the study: Musicians, Card players, and Controls. Participants were matched for age, gender, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Matrix Reasoning, and Digit Span scores. Their performance was measured using auditory spectral and spatial temporal order judgment tests, and four tasks of speech perception in conditions of: no background noise, background noise of speech frequencies, background noise of white noise, and 60% compressed speech. Musicians were better in auditory and speech perception than the other two groups. Card players were similar to Controls in auditory perception tasks, but were better in the speech perception tasks. Non-musician aging adults may be able to improve their speech perception ability by engaging in leisure activity requiring cognitive effort.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Springer Nature B.V. 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Contributing to this dialog, the current exploratory article examines the presence of non-kin members in European seniors' close personal networks. Specifically, we document network connections to people outside of their 10-year birth cohort, both younger ('downward' age integration) and older ('upward' age integration). We consider whether different aspects of social participation-breadth and intensity of activity, and specific types of participation-are associated with age integration and we pay particular attention to variation across four regions of the continent. Analyses use Wave 6 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (<i>N </i>= 34,282) which contains an updated social networks module. Results of descriptive analyses and logistic regression models demonstrate three key findings. First, both forms of age integration are rare-fewer than 10% of older Europeans have non-kin networks that extend beyond their own cohorts. Nevertheless, both forms of age integration tend to be higher in northern and central Europe than in the south and east. Second, two dimensions of formal social activity involvement were associated with age integration, namely activity breadth and intensity. Third, though there was some evidence that particular formal activities were linked to age integration, this pattern was not consistent across the whole of Europe. Overall, findings point to the significance of cultural and organizational variation across Europe as well as to important and increasingly relevant social cleavages in the later segments of adulthood.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Springer Nature B.V. 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, to date few studies have directly investigated resource trajectories during retirement. The current study therefore examines how economic, personal, and social-relational resources change during the retirement transition for people retiring from paid employment and for people retiring from other, non-working labour market statuses (e.g. disability pension, homemaker, unemployment). Based on four representative baseline samples of the German Ageing Survey (1996, 2002, 2008, and 2014) and their respective 6-year follow-up interviews, we identified <i>N</i> = 586 retirees. We then used dual change score models to separately estimate the level and change in income, health, activity, family and non-family network size, and social support for people retiring from paid work (<i>n</i> = 384) and people retiring from other statuses (<i>n</i> = 202) adjusted for age, gender, education, region, period, and time since retirement. Overall, we found that resources changed only modestly during the retirement transition. Resource changes did, however, differ by last labour market status and sociodemographic characteristics. Income and social support declined and family networks increased for both those retiring from paid work and those retiring from other statuses. Leisure activities increased only for those retiring from paid work. No changes in health or non-family networks were observed. People with many resources before retirement also had many resources after retirement. We conclude that retirement affects resources less than researchers often expect. Accordingly, differences based on labour market remain despite retirement.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Springer Nature B.V. 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The mediating role of adulthood circumstances is also explored. Data are derived from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) waves 2 (cross-sectional material) and 3 (retrospective information). The sample includes 23,050 respondents aged 50 +. The EUROD subscales were obtained using factor analysis; scores were transformed to binary constructs; logistic regression models were used to identify predictors; mediation was assessed employing a decomposition technique. Prevalence of both subscales is higher in Southern and Central/Eastern Europe and lower in Nordic countries, which are characterised by more equitable and generous welfare provisions. Though health, childhood socioeconomic status and childhood adversity are significant for both subscales, there are also differences; female gender, adulthood socioeconomic status and stress are associated with affective suffering, whereas age and educational attainment are of greater consequence for motivational symptoms. These findings are quite consistent across regions, indicating that the subscales represent different aspects of depression. By contrast, childhood circumstances are attenuated differentially by adulthood factors across Europe. Nevertheless, important mediating circumstances are stress for affective suffering and poor health for motivational symptoms. The importance of childhood circumstances in all aspects of later life mental health highlights the need for policy interventions across welfare systems, which should target vulnerable groups early in life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Springer Nature B.V. 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study examined self-rated health (SRH), mobility and activities of daily living (ADL) according to level of education in the three oldest old age groups 75-84, 85-94, and 95+, in four Nordic countries. Altogether, 6132 individuals from Danish Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Norwegian Life Course, Ageing and Generation study, Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions of the Oldest Old, the 5-Country Oldest Old (Sweden) and Vitality 90 + Study were analysed. First, associations of education level with SRH, mobility, and ADL were estimated for each individual study by means of age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression. Second, results from individual studies were synthesized in a meta-analysis. Older adults with higher education level were more likely to report good SRH, and they were more often independent in mobility and ADL than those with basic education when all age groups were combined. In mobility and ADL, differences between education groups remained stable across the age groups but for SRH, differences seemed to be weaker in older ages. With only a few exceptions, in all age groups, individuals with higher education had more favourable health and functioning than those with basic education. This study shows remarkable persistence of health and functioning inequalities in the Nordic countries throughout later life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Using historical data available for 377 Sardinian municipalities in the first half of the twentieth century, we performed an ecological study to investigate the geographic distribution of goitre and its spatial association with demographic indicators of population longevity. This analysis was conducted by using both conventional ordinary least square and geographically weighted regression models to take into account spatial autocorrelation and included other longevity-associated factors previously identified in Sardinia. The spatial analysis revealed that the goitre rate (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), the proportion of inhabitants involved in pastoralism (<i>p</i> = 0.016), the terrain inclination (<i>p</i> = 0.008), and the distance from the workplace as a proxy for physical activity (<i>p</i> = 0.023) were consistently associated with population longevity at an aggregated level in the 377 municipalities. Within the limits of an ecological study design, our findings support the existence of a significant association between high goitre prevalence and increased probability to survive into old age. The present study confirms previous results and is consistent with animal studies and epidemiological surveys in other long-lived areas known as Blue Zones. Potential mechanisms underlying this association need to be further investigated.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Springer Nature B.V. 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim of the present study was to evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness over 4 years of two health promoting interventions: senior meetings and a preventive home visit, for community-dwelling older people in relation to no intervention. We applied a Markov model including five states defined in relation to level of dependency of home help and place of residency. The model included transitions between dependency states, scores for quality of life and societal costs for each state, intervention costs and intervention effects for two formats of health promoting interventions. For each intervention and a no-intervention control group, we calculated the accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs over 4 years. Sensitivity analyses included higher intervention costs, lower intervention effects and additional intervention costs and effects related to booster sessions. The results of all analyses indicated that health promotion implemented for community-dwelling older people in the format of senior meetings or a preventive home visit was cost-effective. Both interventions lead to QALY gains and reduce societal costs at any follow-up over 4 years, and thus, resources can be used to implement other interventions. The most important factor for the magnitude of QALY gains and cost savings was the intervention effect. Yearly booster sessions implemented for those persons who maintained their level of functioning extended the intervention effects adding additional QALYs and further reducing societal costs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Telomerase-immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells (hTERT-MSCs) were exposed to various doses of HC for different durations (1-6 days) and analyzed for survival and metabolic activity by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, for cell migratory ability by a wound-healing assay and for osteoblastic and adipogenic differentiation abilities in vitro. Our findings indicate that hTERT-MSCs exposed to HC resulted in a biphasic hormetic dose-response in some measures but not all. Although the mitochondrial and metabolic MTT activity assay clearly showed low-level stimulatory (between 0.1 and 1 µmol/L) and high-level inhibitory effects (from about 10 µmol/L onward), the cytostatic and differentiation-inducing effects were mostly linear at concentrations between 1 and 100 µmol/L.

In the health care market, cloud platform technology is becoming popular, as both patients and physicians demand cost efficiency, easy access to information, and security. Especially for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, it is recommended that pulmonary function test (PFT) be performed on a daily basis. However, it is difficult for patients to frequently visit a hospital to perform the PFT. In this study, we present an application and cloud platform for remote PFT monitoring that can be directly measured by smartphone microphone with no external devices. In addition, we adopted the IBM Watson Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform for PFT monitoring, using a smartphone's built-in microphone with a high-resolution time-frequency representation. We successfully demonstrated real-time PFT monitoring using the cloud platform. The PFT parameters of FEV1/FVC (%) could be remotely monitored when a subject performed the PFT test. As a pilot study, we tested 13 healthy subjects, and found that the absolute error mean was 4.12 and the standard deviation was 3.45 on all 13 subjects. With the developed applications on the cloud platform, patients can freely measure the PFT parameters without restriction on time and space, and a physician can monitor the patients' status in real time. We hope that the PFT monitoring platform will work as a means for early detection and treatment of patients with pulmonary diseases, especially those having asthma and COPD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This review, undertaken to inform new empirical research, covered the perceptions, benefits and purposes of day centres. Searches, undertaken in October/November 2014 and updated in August 2017, of electronic databases, libraries, websites, research repositories and journals, identified seventy-seven relevant papers, mostly non-UK. Day centres were found to play a variety of roles for individuals and in care systems. The largest body of evidence concerned social and preventive outcomes. Centre attendance and participation in interventions within them impacted positively on older people's mental health, social contacts, physical function and quality of life. Evidence about outcomes is mainly non-UK. Day centres for older people without dementia are under-researched generally, particularly in the UK.

Our analyses of data from the General Social Surveys and the International Social Survey Program show that changes over historical time periods are most consistently responsible for temporal differences in work values. In particular, during recent periods Americans tend to place greater importance on jobs that provide security, high income and opportunities for advancement; this is consistent with a narrative that these job rewards have become more difficult to attain recently and are thus more problematic for workers. Some differences in work values are also attributable to aging or life course processes, especially the greater importance placed on high income during the mid-life years when family responsibilities are generally greatest. By contrast, we find few differences in work values among members of different generations or cohorts. We also find that people from less advantaged social origins and those with greater labor market resources are more likely to value economic rewards.</AbstractText>"}

{"PMID":31797985,"Title":"Carbamylation and glycation compete for collagen molecular aging in vivo.","Journal":"Scientific reports","Date":"Dec 04 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Tissue aging is a complex phenomenon involving molecular aging of matrix proteins, which mainly results from their progressive alteration by nonenzymatic post-translational modifications (NEPTMs) such as glycation and carbamylation. These two reactions, which correspond to the binding of reactive metabolites (i.e. reducing sugars and urea-derived cyanate, respectively) on amino groups of proteins, occur during aging and are amplified in various chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease (CKD). Since these reactions target the same functional groups, they can reciprocally compete for protein modification. Determining which NEPTM is predominant in tissues is necessary to better understand their role in the development of long-term complications of chronic diseases. For that purpose, two different murine models were used for reproducing such a competitive context: a CKD-diabetic mice model and a cyanate-consuming mice model. The competition has been evaluated by quantifying glycation and carbamylation products by LC-MS/MS in skin and aorta total extracts as well as in skin type I collagen. The results showed that the simultaneous enhancement of glycation and carbamylation reactions resulted in a decrease of the formation of glycation products (especially Amadori products) whereas the concentrations of homocitrulline, a carbamylation product, remained similar. These results, which have been obtained in both tissues and in purified skin type I collagen, suggest that carbamylation takes precedence over glycation for the modification of tissue proteins, but only in pathological conditions favouring these two NEPTMs. While glycation has been considered for a long time the predominant NEPTM of matrix proteins, carbamylation seems to also play an important role in tissue aging. The existence of competition between these NEPTMs must be taken into account to better understand the consequences of molecular aging of matrix proteins in tissue aging.</AbstractText>"}

It is currently under investigation for multiple nervous system disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). While perturbation of RNA levels by Li has been previously reported, its effects on the whole transcriptome has been given little attention. We, therefore, sought to determine comprehensive effects of Li treatment on RNA levels. We cultured and differentiated human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells to neuronal cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We exposed cultures for one week to lithium chloride or distilled water, extracted total RNA, depleted ribosomal RNA and performed whole-transcriptome RT-sequencing. We analyzed results by RNA length and type. We further analyzed expression and protein interaction networks between selected Li-altered protein-coding RNAs and common AD-associated gene products. Lithium changed expression of RNAs in both non-specific (inverse to sequence length) and specific (according to RNA type) fashions. The non-coding small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were subject to the greatest length-adjusted Li influence. When RNA length effects were taken into account, microRNAs as a group were significantly less likely to have had levels altered by Li treatment. Notably, several Li-influenced protein-coding RNAs were co-expressed or produced proteins that interacted with several common AD-associated genes and proteins. Lithium's modification of RNA levels depends on both RNA length and type. Li activity on snoRNA levels may pertain to bipolar disorders while Li modification of protein coding RNAs may be relevant to AD.</AbstractText>"}

Jetsam ambergris coproliths from the whale are also found occasionally on beaches worldwide. Here we report on the surprising occurrence of ambrein in human adipocere. Adipocere is a waxy substance formed post-mortem during incomplete anaerobic decomposition of soft tissues. Adipocere samples obtained from grave exhumations were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition to the typical fatty acids of adipocere, lesser amounts of ambrein were identified in the samples, in abundances similar to those of the major accompanying faecal steroids. The distribution of these compounds suggests that ambrein was produced post-mortem during the microbial decomposition of faecal residues and tissues. It is assumed that the adipocere matrix of saturated fatty acidsaided the preservation of ambrein over extended periods of time, because adipocere is stable against degradation. The association of ambrein formation in ageing faecal material, under moist, oxygen-depleted conditions, now requires more attention in studies of other mammalian and geological samples. Indeed, ambrein and its transformation products may be useful novel chemical indicators of aged faecal matter and decomposed bodies.</AbstractText>"}

Polyphenolic compounds have been found to possess important roles in the inhibition of numerous ailments that involve reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Diosmin is a citrus flavone that possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and anticancer activities, so based on these properties of diosmin, we decided to evaluate its effect on testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH. A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups having six animals in each. This study was of 28 days in which TP (5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) was administered to induce BPH in the last 10 days of the study. It was found that diosmin at the doses of 20 and 40 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> significantly reduced malondialdehyde and xanthine oxidase formation in a dose-dependent manner; however, it replenished catalase, glutathione (GSH), and GSH-dependent enzymes, that is, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-<i>S</i>-transferase significantly against TP-induced BPH. Further, immunohistochemical study showed that diosmin alleviated inflammatory markers (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin-6). It was also found that diosmin downregulated the expression of androgen receptor and decreased the prostate-specific antigen concentration dose-dependently, significantly against TP-induced BPH. Diosmin also restored histoarchitecture of the prostate in a dose-dependent manner.

This article explores the role of the advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) in identifying frailty and leading comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for older people admitted to acute hospital settings. A small evaluation of CGA led by an ANP in a district general hospital found that a well-rounded assessment of patients living with frailty could be carried out, and that such assessments reduced unscheduled readmission within 28 days of discharge and overall length of hospital stay by six days. In a challenging climate, in which healthcare services seek to deliver effective and efficient care to the frail older population, ANPs can ensure a timely and specialist approach to CGA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 RCN Publishing Company Ltd.

Therefore, it is recommended that weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity should include an intervention such as regular exercise to reduce the concomitant bone loss. However, the most appropriate exercise types to combine with weight loss therapy in this older population is unknown. In a randomized controlled trial, we performed a head-to-head comparison of aerobic or resistance exercise, or both, during matched ~10% weight loss in 160 older adults with obesity. We measured changes in BMD (total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, one-third radius, lumbar spine) and bone markers. Changes between groups were analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures analyses of variance. After 6 months of intensive lifestyle interventions, BMD decreased less in the resistance group (-0.006 g/cm<sup>2</sup> [-0.7%]) and combination group (-0.012 g/cm<sup>2</sup> [-1.1%]) than in the aerobic group (-0.027 g/cm<sup>2</sup> [-2.6%]) (p = 0.001 for between-group comparisons). Serum C-telopeptide, procollagen type 1 N-propeptide, and osteocalcin concentrations increased more in the aerobic group (33%, 16%, and 16%, respectively) than in the resistance group (7%, 2%, and 0%, respectively) and combination group (11%, 2%, and 5%, respectively) (p = 0.004 to 0.048 for between-group comparisons). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the decline in whole body mass and serum leptin were the independent predictors of the decline in hip BMD (multiple R = 0.45 [p &lt; .001]). These findings indicate that compared with aerobic exercise, resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise are associated with less weight loss-induced decrease in hip BMD and less weight loss-induced increase in bone turnover. Therefore, both resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise can be recommended to protect against bone loss during weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity.

Skin ageing causes the appearance of wrinkles, skin sagging and reduced elasticity. Like elsewhere in the body, skin ageing involves an increase in the proportion of cells undergoing cellular senescence (a type of deterioration due to age). Senescent skin cells called dermal fibroblasts have several characteristics that are different to cells that are not senescent, including having what is known as a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide hormone that has many beneficial effects in the body, including protection against age-related disorders. However, less is known about the role of OT in intrinsic skin aging. The authors looked into the role of oxytocin in prevention against senescence in skin cells called normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs), taken from female donors of different ages. They found that OT suppressed SASP-induced senescence in NHDFs derived from young but not old female donors. The authors were also able to learn more about the processes within the body by which OT suppresses SASP and why it affects younger women differently to older women. Their results demonstrate that oxytocin may be effective in the prevention of skin aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We previously reported that subcutaneous administration of partial MHC class II constructs promote behavioral and histological effects in stroke mice by centrally promoting a protective M2 macrophage/microglia phenotype in the CNS and peripherally reversing stroke-associated splenic atrophy.

An example of a prescribing cascade is the co-prescribing of loop diuretics to treat the peripheral oedema caused by calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs. Although well recognised, this is still a combination of medications taken by millions of people worldwide. CCBs have no prognostic benefit in heart failure and have an absolute risk increase for oedema of around 8-18% (number needed to harm 6-13). In the treatment of hypertension, they also increase the risk of oedema and a new diagnosis of heart failure without having any major advantages over alternative drugs. The best way to manage the oedema caused by CCBs is to switch to an alternative medication. Only where this is not possible or fails to achieve therapeutic goals would the CCB-loop diuretic combination appear to be justified. In many cases, therapeutic practice could be improved by targeting people on CCB-loop diuretic combinations for medication review.

In the eye, changes in the choroid and choroidal microcirculation (choriocapillaris) also occur with age, and these changes can play a critical role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In order to develop novel treatments for amelioration of choriocapillaris aging and prevention of AMD, it is essential to understand the cellular and functional changes that occur in the choroid and choriocapillaris during aging. In this review, recent advances in in vivo analysis of choroidal structure and function in AMD patients and patients at risk for AMD are discussed. The pathophysiological roles of fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired resistance to molecular stressors in the choriocapillaris are also considered in terms of their contribution to the pathogenesis of AMD. The pathogenic roles of cardiovascular risk factors that exacerbate microvascular aging processes, such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity as they relate to AMD and choroid and choriocapillaris changes in patients with these cardiovascular risk factors, are also discussed. Finally, future directions and opportunities to develop novel interventions to prevent/delay AMD by targeting fundamental cellular and molecular aging processes are presented.</AbstractText>"}

Here we show in mouse models that DNA damage leads to a transient over-activation of Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and that high activity of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling sensitizes HSCs to DNA damage induced by X-irradiation which results in preferential maintenance of HSCs with low levels of Wnt signaling. The study shows that genetic or chemical activation of canonical Wnt signaling enhances radiosensitivity of HSCs while inhibition of Wnt signaling decreases it. Together, these results indicate that levels of Wnt signaling activity mediate heterogeneity in the sensitivity of HSCs to DNA damage induced depletion. These findings could be relevant for molecular alterations and selection of stem cells in the context of DNA damage accumulation during aging and cancer formation.</AbstractText>"}

This variability stems from the inherent ability of donor RBCs to withstand the physical and chemical insults of cold storage, which ultimately dictate their survival in circulation. The loss of RBC deformability during cold storage is well-established and has been identified as a potential biomarker for the quality of donated RBCs. While RBC deformability has traditionally been indirectly inferred from rheological characteristics of the bulk suspension, there has been considerable interest in directly measuring the deformation of RBCs. Microfluidic technologies have enabled single cell measurement of RBC deformation but have not been able to consistently distinguish differences between RBCs between healthy donors. Using the microfluidic ratchet mechanism, we developed a method to sensitively and consistently analyze RBC deformability. We found that the aging curve of RBC deformability varies significantly across donors, but is consistent for each donor over multiple donations. Specifically, certain donors seem capable of providing RBCs that maintain their deformability during two weeks of cold storage in standard test tubes. The ability to distinguish between RBC units with different storage potential could provide a valuable opportunity to identify donors capable of providing RBCs that maintain their integrity, in order to reserve these units for sensitive transfusion recipients.</AbstractText>"}

It has been argued that the p factor may reflect dysfunctional thinking present in serious mental illness. In support of this, we previously used a theory-free, data-driven multimodal neuroimaging approach to find that higher p factor scores are associated with structural alterations within a cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit (CTCC) and visual association cortex, both of which are important for monitoring and coordinating information processing in the service of executive control. Here we attempt to replicate these associations by conducting region-of-interest analyses using data from 875 members of the Dunedin Longitudinal Study, a five-decade study of a population-representative birth cohort, collected when they were 45 years old. We further sought to replicate a more recent report that p factor scores can be predicted by patterns of distributed cerebellar morphology as estimated through independent component analysis. We successfully replicated associations between higher p factor scores and both reduced gray matter volume of the visual association cortex and fractional anisotropy of pontine white matter pathways within the CTCC. In contrast, we failed to replicate prior associations between cerebellar structure and p factor scores.

Consequently, a number of methodologies have been proposed to determine biological age and primarily exploit variation at the level of DNA methylation (DNAm). A novel epigenetic clock, termed 'DNAm GrimAge' has outperformed its predecessors in predicting the risk of mortality as well as many age-related morbidities. However, the association between DNAm GrimAge and cognitive or neuroimaging phenotypes remains unknown. We explore these associations in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 709, mean age 73 years). Higher DNAm GrimAge was strongly associated with all-cause mortality over the eighth decade (Hazard Ratio per standard deviation increase in GrimAge: 1.81, P &lt; 2.0 × 10<sup>-16</sup>). Higher DNAm GrimAge was associated with lower age 11 IQ (β = -0.11), lower age 73 general cognitive ability (β = -0.18), decreased brain volume (β = -0.25) and increased brain white matter hyperintensities (β = 0.17). There was tentative evidence for a longitudinal association between DNAm GrimAge and cognitive decline from age 70 to 79. Sixty-nine of 137 health- and brain-related phenotypes tested were significantly associated with GrimAge. Adjusting all models for childhood intelligence attenuated to non-significance a small number of associations (12/69 associations; 6 of which were cognitive traits), but not the association with general cognitive ability (33.9% attenuation). Higher DNAm GrimAge associates with lower cognitive ability and brain vascular lesions in older age, independently of early-life cognitive ability. This epigenetic predictor of mortality associates with different measures of brain health and may aid in the prediction of age-related cognitive decline.</AbstractText>"}

This proof of principle study tested whether possible changes of the functional organization of the primary sensorimotor network induced by FaReMuS partly explained the effected fatigue amelioration. We measured the brain activity at rest through electroencephalography equipped with a Functional Source Separation algorithm and we assessed the neurodynamics state of the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices via the Fractal Dimension and their functional connectivity via the Mutual Information. The dynamics of the neuronal electric activity, more distorted in S1 than M1 before treatment, as well as the network connectivity, altered maximally between left and right M1 homologs, reverted to normal after FaReMuS. The intervention-related changes explained 48% of variance of fatigue reduction in the regression model. A personalized neuromodulation tuned in on specific anatomo-functional features of the impaired regions can be effective against fatigue.</AbstractText>"}

Forty-five young adults (23 women, 18-41 years) were included and GT3X + accelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) were placed on their right hip, dominant, and non-dominant wrist for 7 days. We derived Euclidean Norm Minus One g (ENMO), Low-pass filtered ENMO (LFENMO), Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) and ActiGraph activity counts over 5-second epochs from the raw accelerations. Metric values were compared using a correlation analysis, and by plotting the differences by time of the day. Cut points for the dominant wrist were derived using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient optimization in a grid of possible thresholds, using the non-dominant wrist estimates as reference. They were cross-validated in a separate sample (N = 36, 10 women, 22-30 years). Shared variances between pairs of acceleration metrics varied across sites and metric pairs (range in r<sup>2</sup>: 0.19-0.97, all p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that some sites and metrics are associated, and others are not. We observed higher metric values in dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, thus, we developed cut points for dominant wrist based on ENMO to classify sedentary time (&lt;50 mg), light PA (50-110 mg), moderate PA (110-440 mg) and vigorous PA (≥440 mg). Our findings suggest differences between dominant and non-dominant wrist, and we proposed new cut points to attenuate these differences. ENMO and LFENMO were the most similar metrics, and they showed good comparability with MAD. However, counts were not comparable with ENMO, LFENMO and MAD.</AbstractText>"}

Resveratrol is a polyphenol that ameliorates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and delays aging-related processes. Herein we studied the cytoprotective effect of resveratrol on DEP-exposed human lung cells in a factorial experimental design. This work investigates biophysical features including cellular compositions and biomechanical properties, which were measured at the single-cell level using confocal Raman microspectroscopy (RM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and partial least square regression (PLS) analysis were applied to analyze Raman spectra with and without resveratrol protection. The health status of individual cells could be effectively predicted using an index derived from characteristic Raman spectral peak (e.g., 1006 cm<sup>-1</sup>) based on PLS model. AFM measurements indicated that cellular adhesion force was greatly reduced, while Young's modulus was highly elevated in resveratrol treated DEP-exposed cells. Anti-oxidant resveratrol reduced DEP-induced ROS production and suppressed releases of several cytokines and chemokines.

Mutation of the nuclear envelope protein barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (Banf1) has previously been shown to cause a human progeroid disorder, Néstor-Guillermo progeria syndrome (NGPS). The underlying links between Banf1, DNA repair and the ageing process are unknown. Here, we report that Banf1 controls the DNA damage response to oxidative stress via regulation of poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1). Specifically, oxidative lesions promote direct binding of Banf1 to PARP1, a critical NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent DNA repair protein, leading to inhibition of PARP1 auto-ADP-ribosylation and defective repair of oxidative lesions, in cells with increased Banf1. Consistent with this, cells from patients with NGPS have defective PARP1 activity and impaired repair of oxidative lesions. These data support a model whereby Banf1 is crucial to reset oxidative-stress-induced PARP1 activity. Together, these data offer insight into Banf1-regulated, PARP1-directed repair of oxidative lesions.</AbstractText>"}

The UoM cohort was established as a longitudinal study of aging and cognition whereas the BDR program was established, prima facie, to collect brains from both demented and non-demented individuals for the purpose of building a tissue research resource. Consequently, the differences in recruitment patterns generated differences in demographic, clinical, and neuropathological characteristics. There was a higher proportion of recruits with dementia [mostly Alzheimer's disease (AD)] within the BDR cohort than in the UoM cohort. In pathological terms, the BDR cohort was more 'polarized', being more composed of demented cases with high Braak pathology scores and non-demented cases with low Braak scores, and fewer non-AD pathology cases, than the UoM cohort. In both cohorts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy tended to be greater in demented than non-demented individuals. Such observations partly reflect the recruitment of demented and non-demented individuals into the BDR cohort, and also that insufficient study time may have elapsed for disease onset and development in non-demented individuals to take place.

Steatohepatitic HCC (SH-HCC), characterized by HCC with steatosis, is influenced by lipid metabolism disorders. A hypoxic microenvironment is common in HCC and affects lipid metabolism. However, whether hypoxia-induced HIF-2α upregulation exacerbates lipid accumulation to contribute to SH-HCC progression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that HIF-2α was elevated in tissues from NAFLD-HCC patients and was associated with survival. Under hypoxic conditions, upregulated HIF-2α was accompanied by lipid accumulation and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation. HIF-2α knockdown (KD) in steatotic HCC ameliorated triglyceride accumulation and steatosis. HIF-2α-KD steatotic HCC showed minimal lipid synthesis in a hypoxic environment, which contributes to a reduction in malignant behaviours. However, treatment with MHY1485 restored these behaviours. STAM mice, a mouse model that develops NAFLD-HCC, exhibit more rapid tumour progression upon exposure to hypoxia. STAM mice treated with INK-128 presented abrogated mTOR expression and tumour progression under hypoxic conditions with lower triglycerides and steatosis. In conclusion, in a hypoxic microenvironment, HIF-2α upregulation promotes steatotic HCC progression by activating lipid synthesis via the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

We examined how experimentally elevated GCs in pregnant or lactating North American red squirrels (<i>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</i>) affected offspring postnatal growth, structural size and oxidative stress levels (two antioxidants and oxidative protein damage) in three different tissues (blood, heart and liver) and liver telomere lengths. We predicted that offspring from mothers treated with GCs would grow faster but would also have higher levels of oxidative stress and shorter telomeres, which may predict reduced longevity. Offspring from mothers treated with GCs during pregnancy were 8.3% lighter around birth but grew (in body mass) 17.0% faster than those from controls, whereas offspring from mothers treated with GCs during lactation grew 34.8% slower than those from controls and did not differ in body mass around birth. Treating mothers with GCs during pregnancy or lactation did not alter the oxidative stress levels or telomere lengths of their offspring. Fast-growing offspring from any of the treatment groups did not have higher oxidative stress levels or shorter telomere lengths, indicating that offspring that grew faster early in life did not exhibit oxidative costs after this period of growth. Our results indicate that elevations in maternal GCs may induce plasticity in offspring growth without long-term oxidative costs to the offspring that might result in a shortened lifespan.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2020.

A potential mechanism by which predation risk may lastingly shape life-history traits and phenotypes is via effects on telomeres. However, whether prenatal exposure to environmental stressors, such as cues of predator presence, affects postnatal telomere length has not hitherto been investigated. Using an experimental design in which we modified the exposure of yellow-legged gull (<i>Larus michahellis</i>) embryos to social cues of predator presence (i.e. alarm calls), we show that prenatally exposed chicks had shorter telomeres after hatching. As young birds with shorter telomere lengths have reduced fledging success, reproductive success and lifespan, the reduced telomere length in the exposed chicks is likely to have long-term fitness consequences. Moreover, our results provide a mechanistic link through which predators may negatively affect population dynamics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

In this study, we investigated the behavior of heteromeric combinations of wild-type (WT) and mutant Sod1 proteins A4V, L38V, G93A, and G93C in human cells. We showed that both WT and mutant Sod1 formed dimers and oligomers, but only mutant Sod1 accumulated in intracellular inclusions. Coexpression of WT and hSod1 mutants resulted in the formation of a larger number of intracellular inclusions per cell than that observed in cells coexpressing WT or mutant hSod1. The number of inclusions was greater in cells expressing A4V hSod1. To eliminate the contribution of endogenous Sod1, and better evaluate the effect of ALS-associated mutant Sod1 expression, we expressed human Sod1 WT and mutants in human cells knocked down for endogenous Sod1 (Sod1-KD), and in <i>sod1Δ</i> yeast cells. Using Sod1-KD cells we found that the WT-A4V heteromers formed higher molecular weight species compared with A4V and WT homomers. Using the yeast model, in conditions of chronological aging, we concluded that cells expressing Sod1 heterodimers showed decreased antioxidant activity, increased oxidative damage, reduced longevity, and oxidative stress-induced mutant Sod1 aggregation. In addition, we also found that ALS-associated Sod1 mutations reduced nuclear localization and, consequently, impaired the antioxidant response, suggesting this change in localization may contribute to disease in familial ALS. Overall, our study provides insight into the molecular underpinnings of ALS and may open avenues for the design of future therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The analysis compared the prevalence of ED in cannabis users versus controls. Consequently, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated, applying a random-effect model. Five case-control studies were included with data from 3,395 healthy men, 1,035 using cannabis (smoking) and 2,360 nonusers. The overall prevalence of ED in cannabis users was 69.1% (95% CI: 38.0-89.1), whilst the correspondent figure in controls was 34.7% (95% CI: 20.3-52.7). The OR of ED in cannabis users was almost four times that of controls (OR = 3.83; 95% CI: 1.30-11.28; <i>p</i> = .02), even if characterized by high heterogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 90%) and the prediction intervals overlapped 1.00 (95% CI: 0.35-7.26). Data suggest that ED is twice as high in cannabis users compared to controls. Future longitudinal research is needed to confirm/refute this and explore if a dose-response relationship between cannabis and ED may be evident.</AbstractText>"}

Dietary intake provides essential nutrients that support basic cellular processes related to influencing cellular stress response, immune response, cardiometabolic status, neural status, and psychological well-being. Dietary quality has been shown to alter risk for essentially all chronic health conditions including hearing loss and tinnitus. Evidence of nutrients with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ischemic properties, and overall healthy diet quality as otoprotective strategies are slowly accumulating, but many questions remain unanswered. In this article, the authors will discuss (1) animal models in nutritional research, (2) evidence of dietary nutrient-based otoprotection, and (3) consideration of confounds and limitations to nutrient and dietary study in hearing sciences. Given that there are some 60 physiologically essential nutrients, unraveling the intricate biochemistry and multitude of interactions among nutrients may ultimately prove infeasible; however, the wealth of available data suggesting healthy nutrient intake to be associated with improved hearing outcomes suggests the development of evidence-based guidance regarding diets that support healthy hearing may not require precise understanding of all possible interactions among variables. Clinical trials evaluating otoprotective benefits of nutrients should account for dietary quality, noise exposure history, and exercise habits as potential covariates that may influence the efficacy and effectiveness of test agents; pharmacokinetic measures are also encouraged.</AbstractText>"}

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus have been the number 1 and number 2 disabilities at U.S. Veterans hospitals since 2006. In a reversal of original protocols to identify candidate genes associated with monogenic deafness disorders, unbiased genome-wide association studies now direct animal experiments in order to explore genetic variants common in Homo sapiens. However, even these approaches must utilize animal studies for validation of function and understanding of mechanisms. Animal research currently focuses on genetic expression profiles since the majority of variants occur in non-coding regions, implying regulatory divergences. Moving forward, it will be important in both human and animal research to define the phenotypes of hearing loss and tinnitus, as well as exposure parameters, in order to extricate genes related to acoustic trauma versus those related to aging. It has become clear that common disorders like acoustic trauma are influenced by large numbers of genes, each with small effects, which cumulatively lead to susceptibility to a disorder. A polygenic risk score, which aggregates these small effect sizes of multiple genes, may offer a more accurate description of risk for NIHL and/or tinnitus.</AbstractText>"}

Classically, it has been linked to critical telomere curtailment following repetitive cell divisions, and later described as a response to oncogenes and other stressors. Currently, there are compelling new directions indicating that a comparable state of cellular senescence might be adopted also by postmitotic cell entities, including terminally differentiated neurons. However, the cellular upstream inducers and molecular downstream cues mediating a senescence-like state in neurons (amitosenescence) are ill-defined. Here, we address the phenomenon of abortive atypical cell cycle activity in light of amitosenescence, and discuss why such replicative reprogramming might provide a yet unconsidered source to explain senescence in maturated neurons. We also hypothesize the existence of a G<sub>0</sub> subphase as a priming factor for cell cycle re-entry, in analogy to discoveries in quiescent muscle stem cells.

These outcomes are mediated by senescence-associated changes in gene expressions, which sometimes lead to the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, or senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that contribute to paradoxical pro-tumorigenic effects. p53 functions as a transcription factor in cell-autonomous responses such as cell-cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular senescence, and also non-cell-autonomous responses to DNA damage by mediating the SASP function of immune system activation. The human <i>TP53</i> gene encodes twelve protein isoforms, which provides an explanation for the pleiotropic p53 function on cellular senescence. Recent reports suggest that some short isoforms of p53 may modulate gene expressions in a full-length p53-dependent and -independent manner, in other words, some p53 isoforms cooperate with full-length p53, whereas others operate independently. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the biological activities and functions of p53 isoforms, especially Δ40p53, Δ133p53α, and p53β, on cellular senescence, ageing, age-related disorder, reprogramming, and cancer.

Many changes are subtle, but can negatively affect nutrient intake, leading to overt malnutrition. Poor oral health may affect food selection and nutrient intake, leading to malnutrition and, consequently, to frailty and sarcopenia. On the other hand, it has been highlighted that sarcopenia is a whole-body process also affecting muscles dedicated to chewing and swallowing. Hence, muscle decline of these muscle groups may also have a negative impact on nutrient intake, increasing the risk for malnutrition. The interplay between oral diseases and malnutrition with frailty and sarcopenia may be explained through biological and environmental factors that are linked to the common burden of inflammation and oxidative stress. The presence of oral problems, alone or in combination with sarcopenia, may thus represent the biological substratum of the disabling cascade experienced by many frail individuals. A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach, including personalized dietary counselling and oral health care, may thus be helpful to better manage the complexity of older people. Furthermore, preventive strategies applied throughout the lifetime could help to preserve both oral and muscle function later in life.

The HF of the older women did not differ across the fat mass index categories, but in men the obese group was lower than the normal and excess fat groups. The hydration factor calculated for the total sample of older Hispanic-American people is higher than the HF values reported in the literature.

We examined the effect of delivery of TMS in liposomes on the restoration of vasodilator responses of isolated aortic vessels after acute tension elevation ex vivo. Aortic vessels from young male Wistar rats were isolated, and endothelial-dependent (acetylcholine, ACh) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) responses assessed. Acute tension elevation (1 h) significantly reduced ACh dilator responses, which were restored following incubation with superoxide dismutase or apocynin (an NADPH oxidase inhibitor). Incubation with TMS-loaded liposomes (mean diameter 157 ± 6 nm; PDI 0.097) significantly improved the attenuated dilator responses following tension elevation, which was sustained over a longer period (4 h) when compared to TMS solution. Endothelial denudation or co-incubation with L-NNA (Nω-nitro-l-arginine; nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) resulted in loss of dilator function. Our findings suggest that TMS-loaded liposomes can restore attenuated endothelial-dependent dilator responses induced by an oxidative environment by reducing NADPH-oxidase-derived ROS and potentiating the release of the vasodilator nitric oxide. TMS-loaded liposomes may be a promising therapeutic strategy to restore vasodilator function in vascular disease.</AbstractText>"}

When hydrogen is charged, it first suppresses the transformations B2↔B19' and R↔B19' in the surface layer, and when its distribution over the volume becomes uniform, such transformations are suppressed throughout the material. The kinetics of hydrogen redistribution is determined by the hydrogen diffusion coefficient D<sub>H</sub>, which depends on the grain size. In nanocrystalline Ti<sub>49.1</sub>Ni<sub>50.9</sub> (at%) specimens, D<sub>H</sub> is three times greater than its value in coarse-grained ones, which is likely due to the larger free volume and larger contribution of hydrogen diffusion along grain boundaries in the nanocrystalline material.

Clinical","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Diffusion MRI, Diffusion spectrum imaging, Machine learning, Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, White matter brain age","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Brain age prediction based on machine learning has been applied to various neurological diseases to discover its clinical values. By this innovative approach, it has been reported that the patients with refractory epilepsy had premature brain aging. Of refractory epilepsy, right and left subtypes of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) are the most common forms and exhibit distinct patterns in white matter alterations. So far, it is unclear whether these two subtypes of MTLE would have difference in white matter aging due to distinct white matter alterations. To address this issue, a machine learning based brain age model using diffusion MRI data was established to investigate biological age of white matter tracts. All diffusion MRI datasets were obtained from the same 3-Tesla MRI scanner. To build the brain age prediction model, diffusion MRI datasets of 300 healthy participants were processed to extract age-relevant diffusion indices from 76 major white matter tracts. The extracted diffusion indices underwent Gaussian process regression to build the prediction model for white matter brain age. The model was validated in an independent testing set (N = 40) to ensure no overfitting of the model. The model was then applied to patients with right and left MTLE and matched controls (right MTLE: N = 17, left MTLE: N = 18, controls: N = 37), and predicted age difference (PAD) was obtained by calculating the difference between each individual's predicted brain age and chronological age. The higher PAD score indicated older brain age. The results showed that right MTLE exhibited older predicted brain age than the other two groups (PAD of right MTLE = 10.9 years [p &lt; 0.05 against left MTLE; p &lt; 0.001 against control]; PAD of left MTLE = 2.2 years [p &gt; 0.1 against control]; PAD of controls = 0.82 years). Patients with right and left MTLE showed strong correlations of the PAD scores with age of onset and duration of illness, but both groups showed opposite directions of correlations. In right MTLE, positive correlation of PAD with seizure frequency was found, and the right uncinate fasciculus was the most attributable tract to the increase in PAD. In conclusion, the present study found that patients with right MTLE exhibited premature white matter brain aging and their PAD scores were correlated with seizure frequency. Therefore, PAD is a potentially useful indicator of white matter impairment and disease severity in patients with right MTLE.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Electroencephalography (EEG) directly reflects functioning of brain synapses with a uniquely high temporal resolution, necessary for investigation of brain network dynamics. Since synaptic dysfunction is an early event and best correlate of cognitive status and decline in patients along Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, EEG microstates might serve as valuable early markers of AD. The present study investigated differences in EEG microstate topographies and parameters (duration, occurrence and contribution) between a large cohort of healthy elderly (n = 308) and memory clinic patients: subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 210); mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 230) and AD (n = 197) and how they correlate to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD. Four most representative microstate maps assigned as classes A, B (asymmetrical), C and D (symmetrical) were computed from the resting state EEGs since it has been shown previously that this is sufficient to explain most of the resting state EEG data. Statistically different topography of microstate maps were found between the controls and the patient groups for microstate classes A, C and D. Changes in the topography of microstate class C were associated with the CSF Aβ42 levels, whereas changes in the topography of class B were linked with the CSF p-tau levels. Gradient-like increase in the contribution of asymmetrical (A and B) and gradient-like decrease in the contribution of symmetrical (C and D) maps were observed with the more severe stage of cognitive impairment. Our study demonstrated extensive relationship of resting state EEG microstates topographies and parameters with the stage of cognitive impairment and AD biomarkers. Resting state EEG microstates might therefore serve as functional markers of early disruption of neurocognitive networks in patients along AD continuum.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to understand how IL-6, adipokines and ghrelin plasma levels could be influenced by cancer on the one hand, and by age, frailty, and nutritional status in old cancer patients on the other hand. Ninety-nine patients aged 79[76-83] years old were included. Sixty-six percent had advanced stages of cancer, and 34% had cachexia. Fifty percent were at risk of malnutrition, and 10% had overt malnutrition. None of the variables studied was significantly correlated with the advanced stage, or cachexia. In multiple regression, the only parameter significantly and positively associated with age was adiponectin (p = 0.008). Despite a high prevalence of frailty in our study, we did not find any independent association of frailty (assessed by G8) with IL-6, leptin, adiponectin, or ghrelin in multivariate analysis. We observed that a low albumin level was independently associated with a higher level of IL-6 (p &lt; 0.0001), but not with the MNA score. However, leptin showed a positive correlation with BMI (p &lt; 0.0001), confirming the persistence of a relationship between leptin and adiposity, even in older cancer patients. Finally, high IL-6 level was associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.027).

Both medical und non-medical interests are of benefit for skin research in general because the results from these studies help to deepen our understanding of the complex molecular, biological, cell signaling, developmental and immunological processes in this organ. In fact, the skin is an ideal organ to observe and analyze the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of aging. Within the past five years technological advances like lineage tracing of cells in model organisms, intra-vital microscopy, nucleic acid sequencing at the single cell level, and high resolution mass spectrometry have allowed to study aging and senescence of individual skin cells within the tissue context, their signaling and communication, and to derive new hypotheses for experimental studies in vitro.

Here, we report how functionally unfavourable protein interactions can be induced by structural fuzziness, i.e. by persisting conformational disorder in protein complexes. We show that extreme disorder in the bound state transforms the intrinsically disordered protein SERF1a from an RNA-organizing factor into a pathogenic enhancer of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) amyloid toxicity. We demonstrate that SERF1a promotes the incorporation of RNA into nucleoli and liquid-like artificial RNA-organelles by retaining an unusually high degree of conformational disorder in the RNA-bound state. However, this type of structural fuzziness also determines an undifferentiated interaction with aSyn. RNA and aSyn both bind to one identical, positively charged site of SERF1a by an analogous electrostatic binding mode, with similar binding affinities, and without any observable disorder-to-order transition. The absence of primary or secondary structure discriminants results in SERF1a being unable to select between nucleic acid and amyloidogenic protein, leading the pro-amyloid aSyn:SERF1a interaction to prevail in the cytosol under conditions of cellular stress. We suggest that fuzzy disorder in SERF1a complexes accounts for an adverse gain-of-interaction which favours toxic binding to aSyn at the expense of non-toxic RNA binding, thereby leading to a functionally distorted and pathogenic process. Thus, structural fuzziness constitutes a direct link between extreme conformational flexibility, amyloid aggregation and the malfunctioning of RNA-associated cellular processes, three signatures of neurodegenerative proteinopathies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we demonstrate that yeast aged under environmental copper accumulate high levels of eccDNA containing the copper-resistance gene CUP1. Transcription of the tandemly repeated CUP1 gene causes CUP1 eccDNA accumulation, which occurs in the absence of phenotypic selection. We have developed a sensitive and quantitative eccDNA sequencing pipeline that reveals CUP1 eccDNA accumulation on copper exposure to be exquisitely site specific, with no other detectable changes across the eccDNA complement. eccDNA forms de novo from the CUP1 locus through processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by Sae2, Mre11 and Mus81, and genome-wide analyses show that other protein coding eccDNA species in aged yeast share a similar biogenesis pathway. Although abundant, we find that CUP1 eccDNA does not replicate efficiently, and high-copy numbers in aged cells arise through frequent formation events combined with asymmetric DNA segregation. The transcriptional stimulation of CUP1 eccDNA formation shows that age-linked genetic change varies with transcription pattern, resulting in gene copy number profiles tailored by environment.</AbstractText>"}

We recently showed that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase interacting protein 2 (GIT2) plays a key role in both DNA damage and oxidative stress. Multiple tissue analyses in GIT2KO mice demonstrated that GIT2 expression affects the GPCR relaxin family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3), and is thus a therapeutically-targetable system. RXFP3 and GIT2 play similar roles in metabolic aging processes. Gaining a detailed understanding of the RXFP3-GIT2 functional relationship could aid the development of novel anti-aging therapies. We determined the connection between RXFP3 and GIT2 by investigating the role of RXFP3 in oxidative stress and DDR. Analyzing the effects of oxidizing (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and DNA-damaging (camptothecin) stressors on the interacting partners of RXFP3 using Affinity Purification-Mass Spectrometry, we found multiple proteins linked to DDR and cell cycle control. RXFP3 expression increased in response to DNA damage, overexpression, and Relaxin 3-mediated stimulation of RXFP3 reduced phosphorylation of DNA damage marker H2AX, and repair protein BRCA1, moderating DNA damage. Our data suggests an RXFP3-GIT2 system that could regulate cellular degradation after DNA damage, and could be a novel mechanism for mitigating the rate of age-related damage accumulation.</AbstractText>"}

In this paper we propose a conceptually new approach for the identification of novel longevity-associated genes and potential target genes for SNPs in non-coding regions by utilizing the knowledge of co-location of various loci, governed by the three-dimensional architecture of the <i>Drosophila</i> genome. Firstly, we created networks between genes/genomic regions harboring SNPs deemed to be significant in two longevity GWAS summary statistics datasets using intra- and inter-chromosomal interaction frequencies (Hi-C data) as a measure of co-location. These networks were further extended to include regions strongly interacting with previously selected regions. Using various network measures, literature search and additional bioinformatics resources, we investigated the plausibility of genes found to have genuine association with longevity. Several of the newly identified genes were common between the two GWAS datasets and these possessed human orthologs. We also found that the proportion of non-coding SNPs in borders between topologically associated domains is significantly higher than expected by chance. Assuming co-location, we investigated potential target genes for non-coding SNPs. This approach therefore offers a stepping stone to identification of novel genes and SNP targets linked to human longevity.</AbstractText>"}

In the diurnal primate eye and retina, it is necessary to scale the number of cones versus the number of rods with different exponents to defend their respective functions of spatial acuity and sensitivity in eyes of different sizes. The order of photoreceptor precursor specification, cones specified first, rods second, couples their respective cell numbers at maturity to the kinetics of embryonic stem cell proliferation. Different durations of retinogenesis change the ratio of rods to cones produced so as to defend both functions over a range of eye diameters. In the evolution of nocturnality, the same coupling of photoreceptor specification to neurogenesis is altered to fewer cones and many more rods in nocturnal eyes, by delaying the onset of retinogenesis. Similarly, the neocortex also shows coupling of the specification of laminar position with duration of neurogenesis. Overall, duration of neurogenesis directly predicts neocortex volume in most mammalian clades. In larger brains with longer neocortical neurogenesis, its organization changes progressively, differentiating the frontal pole from the occipital pole in volume of connectivity and number of neurons per unit column. This permits greater, hierarchically organized information abstraction with increasing neocortex volume. Exceptions do exist, however, in species of three separate taxa, marsupials, naked mole rats, and bats, which break the correlation of neurodevelopmental duration and brain size. Naked mole rats and bats both have small brains and unusual longevity, coupled with neurodevelopmental periods characteristic of much bigger-brained animals, raising the possibility that developmental duration and lifespan have some genetic or mechanistic control in common. The role of duration of development in mediating between the mechanistic levels of construction of retinal and cortical organization, and the different life histories associated with larger brains, such as duration of parental care, learning and overall longevity are discussed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The important but difficult task of characterizing structural ensembles in crystals is typically limited to small conformational changes, such as multiple side-chain conformations. A crystallographic method was recently introduced that utilizes residual electron and anomalous density (READ) to characterize structural ensembles encompassing large-scale structural changes. Key to this method is an ability to accurately measure anomalous signals and distinguish them from noise or other anomalous scatterers. This report presents an optimized data-collection and analysis strategy for partially occupied iodine anomalous signals. Using the long-wavelength-optimized beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source, the ability to accurately distinguish the positions of anomalous scatterers with occupancies as low as ∼12% is demonstrated. The number and positions of these anomalous scatterers are consistent with previous biophysical, kinetic and structural data that suggest that the protein Im7 binds to the chaperone Spy in multiple partially occupied conformations. Finally, READ selections demonstrate that re-measured data using the new protocols are consistent with the previously characterized structural ensemble of the chaperone Spy with its client Im7.

We show here that inhibition of lysosomal acidification triggers cellular iron deficiency, which results in impaired mitochondrial function and non-apoptotic cell death. These effects are recovered by supplying iron via a lysosome-independent pathway. Notably, iron deficiency is sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured primary neurons. Using a mouse model of impaired lysosomal acidification, we observed a robust iron deficiency response in the brain, verified by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, the brains of these mice present a pervasive inflammatory signature associated with instability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), both corrected by supplementation of the mice diet with iron.

Different descriptors of the connectivity graph potentially relate to different underlying mechanisms of propagation. Previous approaches for evaluating the influence of connectivity on neurodegeneration consider each descriptor in isolation and match predictions against late-stage atrophy patterns. We introduce the notion of a <i>topological profile</i> - a characteristic combination of topological descriptors that best describes the propagation of pathology in a particular disease. By drawing on recent advances in disease progression modeling, we estimate topological profiles from the full course of pathology accumulation, at both cohort and individual levels. Experimental results comparing topological profiles for Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and normal ageing show that topological profiles explain the observed data better than single descriptors. Within each condition, most individual profiles cluster around the cohort-level profile, and individuals whose profiles align more closely with other cohort-level profiles show features of that cohort.

Telomere length plays an important role in aging. Despite the great benefits of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), the acute responses to HIIT with different intervals have not been elucidated in different sexes. This study was conducted to investigate the sex-dependent responses of telomerase enzyme activity, total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the ratio of TAC/TOS to short- and long-term high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) in cardiac muscle of male and female rats. Forty adult Wistar rats were randomly allocated to six groups: male and female HIIE with short-term intervals (MHIIESh and FHIIESh, respectively), male and female HIIE with long-term intervals (MHIIEL and FHIIEL, respectively), and controls groups. Telomerase activity, TAC, and TOS levels were examined immediately after exercise in the cardiac muscle. The level of telomerase enzyme activity, TOS level, and the ratio of TAC/TOS did not change after HIIE with short-term interval and HIIE with long-term interval (HIIEL) in male and female rats (P = 0.52, 0.69, and 0.08, respectively). There was a statistically significant decrease in the TAC level in the MHIIESh group (P = 0.04). Furthermore, a significant decrease was observed in the HIIEL in both male and female rats (P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Acute exposure to HIIE with short- and long-term intervals would not result in a significant change in some indicators of biological aging. However, due to gender-specific biological differences, further studies will provide evidence regarding the roles of HIIE at different times of intervals, which contribute to aging prevention.</AbstractText>"}

As incidence and prevalence increase, the medical field is focused on providing more appropriate therapies. It is common knowledge that ED is a chronic condition that is also associated with a myriad of other disorders. Conditions such as aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, prostatic hypertrophy, and prostate cancer, among others, have a direct implication on the onset and progression of ED. Characterization and recognition of risk factors may help clinicians recognize and properly treat patients suffering from ED. One of the most reliable treatments for ED is penile prosthetic surgery. Since the introduction of the penile prosthesis (PP) in the early seventies, this surgical procedure has improved the lives of thousands of men, with reliable and satisfactory results. The aim of this review article is to characterize the epidemiology of men undergoing penile prosthetic surgery, with a discussion about the most common conditions involved in the development of ED, and that ultimately drive patients into electing to undergo PP placement.</AbstractText>"}

Survivors report chronic skeletal muscle weakness and development of new functional limitations that persist for years. To delineate mechanisms of sepsis-induced chronic weakness, we first surpassed a critical barrier by establishing a murine model of sepsis with ICU-like interventions that allows for the study of survivors. We show that sepsis survivors have profound weakness for at least 1 month, even after recovery of muscle mass. Abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, impaired respiration and electron transport chain activities, and persistent protein oxidative damage were evident in the muscle of survivors. Our data suggest that sustained mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than atrophy alone, underlies chronic sepsis-induced muscle weakness. This study emphasizes that conventional efforts that aim to recover muscle quantity will likely remain ineffective for regaining strength and improving quality of life after sepsis until deficiencies in muscle quality are addressed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, Owen et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We analysed how perceived stress and work stressors (work demands, decision authority and workplace social support) are related to key dimensions of insomnia over time, using structural equation modelling. Biennial measurements from a large sample of the working population in Sweden enabled us to analyse both the relationship from stress to sleep as well as that from sleep to stress. Overall, we found reciprocal relations between insomnia and all four stress measures. However, looking at the relation between each dimension of insomnia and each stress measure, there were some differences in direction of effects. In the direction from stress to sleep, all work stressors as well as perceived stress predicted both difficulties initiating sleep and difficulties maintaining sleep. The same was found for non-restorative sleep, with the exception for decision authority. In the opposite direction, difficulties maintaining sleep predicted increased levels of work demands and perceived stress. Difficulties initiating sleep stood out among the insomnia symptoms as not predicting any of the stress measures, while non-restorative sleep was the only symptom predicting all stress measures. The results advance the understanding of the stress-sleep relationship and indicate a potential vicious circle between insomnia and perceived stress as well as work stressors, suggesting that the workplace could be an arena for interventions to alleviate insomnia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Severe HPP presents in childhood but milder forms can present in adulthood. The prevalence and clinical features of adult HPP are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of low serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in a clinic-based population of adult osteoporotic patients. We searched for patients with low ALP in a cohort of 3285 patients referred to an osteoporosis clinic over a 10-year period and performed mutation screening of ALPL in those with low ALP (≤40 U/L) on two or more occasions. These individuals were matched with four clinic controls with a normal ALP. We also evaluated the prevalence of low ALP and ALPL mutations in 639 individuals from the general population from the same region. We identified 16/3285 (0.49%) clinic patients with low ALP and 14 (87.5%) had potentially pathogenic variants in ALPL. Eight of these individuals were heterozygous for mutations previously described in HPP and 2 were heterozygous for novel mutations (p.Arg301Trp and p.Tyr101X). These mutations were not found in clinic controls or in the general population. Eight patients with low ALP, including 4 with ALPL mutations, were treated with bisphosphonates for an average of 6.5 years. In these individuals, the rate of fractures during treatment was comparable to that in normal ALP clinic controls who were treated with bisphosphonates. We conclude that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ALPL are common in osteoporosis patients with low ALP.

Altered gene expression may offer insights into disease pathophysiology and thus open new perspectives toward designing pathophysiology-driven therapeutics. Therefore, the current study aimed at identifying naturally occurring differences in tendon micro-morphology and gene expression of newborn, young and old horses. Age-related differences in the distribution pattern of tendon fibril thickness and in the expression of the tendon relevant genes collagen type 1 (Col1), Col3, Col5, tenascin-C, decorin, tenomodulin, versican, scleraxis and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein were investigated. A qualitative and quantitative gene expression and collagen fibril diameter analysis was performed for the most frequently injured equine tendon, the superficial digital flexor tendon, in comparison with the deep digital flexor tendon. Most analyzed genes (Col1, Col3, Col5, tenascin-C, tenomodulin, scleraxis) were expressed at a higher level in foals (age ≤ 6 months) than in horses of 2.75 years (age at which flexor tendons become mature in structure) and older, decorin expression increased with age. Decorin was previously reported to inhibit the lateral fusion of collagen fibrils, causing a thinner fibril diameter with increased decorin concentration. The results of this study suggested that reduction of tendon fibril diameters commonly seen in equine tendons with increasing age might be a natural age-related phenomenon leading to greater fibril surface areas with increased fibrillar interaction and reduced sliding at the fascicular/fibrillar interface and hence a stiffer interfascicular/interfibrillar matrix. This may be a potential reason for the higher propensity to tendinopathies with increasing age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The most common types of bone protective bioactives are flavonoids, stilbene, triterpenoids, coumestans, lignans, and phenolic acid. The actions of natural products can be mediated by acting systemically on the hormonal axis or locally via their direct or indirect effects on osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, as well as adipogenesis.

D-galactose administration may impair memory and mimic the effects of natural aging. In this study, the efficiency of goat milk to protect against memory decline was tested. Fifty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: (i) control group, (ii) goat milk treated group, (iii) D-galactose treated group, and (iv) goat milk plus D-galactose treated group. Subcutaneous injections of D-galactose at 120 mg/kg and oral administrations of goat milk at 1 g/kg were chosen for the study. Goat milk and D-galactose were administered concomitantly for 6 weeks, while the control group received saline. After 6 weeks, novel object recognition and T-maze tests were performed to evaluate memory of rats. Following behavioral tests, the animals were sacrificed, and right brain homogenates were analyzed for levels of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes and neurotrophic factors. The left brain hemisphere was used for histological study of prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. There was a significant memory impairment, an increase in oxidative stress and neurodegeneration and a reduction in antioxidant enzymes and neurotrophic factors levels in the brain of D-galactose treated rats compared to controls. Goat milk treatment attenuated memory impairment induced by D-galactose via suppressing oxidative stress and neuronal damage and increasing neurotrophic factors levels, thereby suggesting its potential role as a geroprotective food.</AbstractText>"}

They are often caused by variants that disrupt genes encoding components of extracellular matrix (ECM). The fibulin glycoproteins are ECM proteins important for integrity of tissues including dermis, retina, fascia, and vasculature. The fibulin family consists of seven members (fibulins-1 to -7) and is defined by a fibulin-type domain at the C-terminus. The family is associated with human diseases, for instance a variant in FBLN1, encoding fibulin-1, is associated with synpolydactyly, while one in EFEMP1, encoding fibulin-3, causes Doyne honeycomb degeneration of the retina. Loss-of-function of fibulins-4 and -5 causes cutis laxa, while variants in fibulins-5 and -6 are associated with age-related macular degeneration. Of note, EFEMP1 is not currently associated with any connective tissue disorder. Here we show biallelic loss-of-function variants in EFEMP1 in an individual with multiple and recurrent abdominal and thoracic herniae, myopia, hypermobile joints, scoliosis, and thin translucent skin. Fibroblasts from this individual express significantly lower EFEMP1 transcript than age-matched control cells. A skin biopsy, visualised using light microscopy, showed normal structure and abundance of elastic fibres. The phenotype of this individual is remarkably similar to the Efemp1 knockout mouse model that displays multiple herniae with premature aging and scoliosis. We conclude that loss of EFEMP1 function in this individual is the cause of a connective tissue disorder with a novel combination of phenotypic features, and can perhaps explain similar, previously reported cases in the literature.</AbstractText>"}

On the other hand, disorders or modifications in the sensitivity or expression of these extraoral receptors can affect physiological functions. Here we evaluated the role of the bitter receptor TAS2R38 in attainment of longevity, since it has been widely associated with individual differences in taste perception, food preferences, diet, nutrition, immune responses and pathophysiological mechanisms. Differences in genotype distribution and haplotype frequency at the TAS2R38 gene between a cohort of centenarian and near-centenarian subjects and two control cohorts were determined. Results show in the centenarian cohort an increased frequency of subjects carrying the homozygous genotype for the functional variant of TAS2R38 (PAV/PAV) and a decreased frequency of those having homozygous genotype for the non-functional form (AVI/AVI), as compared to those determined in the two control cohorts. In conclusion, our data providing evidence of an association between genetic variants of TAS2R38 gene and human longevity, suggest that TAS2R38 bitter receptor can be involved in the molecular physiological mechanisms implied in the biological process of aging.</AbstractText>"}

Despite being neglected as an agricultural byproduct of polished rice, pigmented rice bran has emerged as a promising source of natural anti-aging compounds. Indeed, the extract of red rice bran Hom Dang cultivar contained rich phenolic acids and flavonoids. It displayed high antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo assays. Using yeast model, extract and bioactive compounds, quercetin and protocatechuic acid found in the rice bran pericarp, effectively reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), restored plasma membrane damages and prolonged life-span of pre-treated wild-yeast cells. Importantly, these molecules modulated life span-extension through a mechanism of ROS reduction that resembles to that operated under the highly conserved Tor1- and Sir2-dependent signaling pathways, with the human homologs TORC1 and SIRT1, respectively. The key longevity factors Sch9 and Rim15 kinases, Msn2/4 regulators and a novel transcription factor Asg1, the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidases played important role in mediating longevity. Yeast clearly provides an instrumental platform for rapid screening of compounds with anti-aging efficacies and advances knowledge in the molecular study of ageing.</AbstractText>"}

SnCs cause chronic inflammation, and removing SnCs decelerates aging in mice. Despite their importance, turnover rates of SnCs are unknown, and their connection to aging dynamics is unclear. Here we use longitudinal SnC measurements and induction experiments to show that SnCs turn over rapidly in young mice, with a half-life of days, but slow their own removal rate to a half-life of weeks in old mice. This leads to a critical-slowing-down that generates persistent SnC fluctuations. We further demonstrate that a mathematical model, in which death occurs when fluctuating SnCs cross a threshold, quantitatively recapitulates the Gompertz law of mortality in mice and humans. The model can go beyond SnCs to explain the effects of lifespan-modulating interventions in Drosophila and C. elegans, including scaling of survival-curves and rapid effects of dietary shifts on mortality.</AbstractText>"}

It is now established that both multi-walled (MWCNTs) and single-walled (SWCNTs) carbon nanotubes might contribute to pulmonary disease. Although multiple mechanisms might be involved in CNT induced pathogenesis, systematic understanding of the relationship between different CNT exposure (MWCNT vs SWCNT) and autophagy/ apoptosis/ necrosis, in human lung epithelial cells remains limited. In this study, we demonstrate that exposure to MWCNT (NM-400), but not SWCNT (NIST-SRM2483), leads to an autophagic response after acute exposure (24 h). MWCNT exposure was characterized by an increase in anti-apoptotic BCL2, downregulation of executor Caspase-3/7 and increase in expression of genes from the autophagy machinery. For SWCNT exposure however, we observed an overexpression of executor Caspase-3/7 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic BAX; enrichment for processes like cornification, apoptotic process, cell differentiation from proteomic analysis. These results clearly indicate a major difference in the pathways initiated by the CNTs, in vitro. While the present study design provides mechanistic understanding after an acute exposure for the tested CNTs, we believe that the information obtained here would have relevance in better understanding of CNT toxicity and pathogenesis in general.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Bioretention cells can infiltrate stormwater from roads and parking lots, and as stormwater passed through the soils, metals can be removed. Metal removal and storage has been demonstrated in laboratory media columns and field-scale test cells, but we have an incomplete understanding of metal removal and accumulation in aging bioretention cells in the field. We surveyed 25 bioretention cells (0-7 years of service) for soil physicochemistry to determine which characteristics related to soil metal (Cu, Pb, and Zn) concentrations. We collected soil cores and treated them with simulated stormwater to measure potential rates of metal removal under different metal and salt concentrations. Older bioretention cells had higher Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations in soil, which indicates accumulation and storage over time. The oldest cells had metal concentrations that were not a risk to human health but which approached screening thresholds for potential impairment of plants. Soil organic matter content (OM) was positively associated with metal concentrations which highlights the importance of OM in the functioning of cells. Retrofit bioretention cells were younger with less OM and more clay than cells built concurrently with new parking lot construction (i.e., de novo), but after 2.7 years of service, soil OM was similar between retrofit and de novo builds. Soil cores from de novo bioretention cells retained more stormwater metals than soil cores from retrofit cells, and this was likely due to differences in soil OM. Elevated road salt in stormwater was associated with less effective metal removal and leaching of Zn from soils. Overall, these data suggest that management (e.g., salting) and design (e.g., construction) decisions can greatly influence metal removal function of bioretention cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, soil samples were spiked with two types of bare nanoparticles: b1ZnO NPs (rod- and elongated-shaped) and b2ZnO NPs (near-spherical shaped) and ZnO NPs coated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (cZnO NPs) within the 0-800 mg Zn kg<sup>-1</sup> soil dose range, and were left to age for 0, 30, 60 and 90 days. The available concentration and speciation of Zn in soil were determined by the DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films) technique and sequential extraction procedures, respectively. The toxicity of the aqueous extracts from the ZnO NP-treated soils was assessed in vitro in established fish cell lines (RTG-2). The highest distribution percentages of the applied Zn occurred in the organically complexed (OC), followed by the exchangeable (EXC) fraction, for all NP types, applied doses and incubation times. The toxicity of NPs depended on their intrinsic properties: b1ZnO NPs affected the membrane function, reductase enzyme activity and, to a lesser extent, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of fish cells, whereas b2ZnO NPs and cZnO NPs affected mainly ROS generation. Ageing increased Zn soil availability, but toxicity to fish cells showed no trend over time. The particle dissolution of ZnO NPs did not explain the observed toxicity, hence a nanoparticles-specific effect should be assumed. The findings of this study seem to indicate that the transfer of ZnO NP from contaminated soils to aquatic ecosystems should be addressed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated interactions between cortical expression of 10 VEGF gene family members and APOE-ε4 genotype to clarify which VEGF genes modify the association between APOE-ε4 and cognitive decline.

We are not in favor of the classic continuous bull's horn scar because, on the one hand, we consider that most of the labial shortening is due to the nasal floor resection -the internal excursion of which determines the final result-, and on the other hand that the approximation of 2 skins of very different nature (columella and lip) may cause a visible scar. The base of the columella is particularly well vascularized by the anastomosis of branches derived from the external carotid artery via the superior labial artery and septal branches distributed from the internal carotid system. We therefore consider that this zone on each side of the base of the columella constitutes the vascular pivot of our 'mustache flap' drawn according to the classic peri nasal incision: this flap is desepidermized and then totally elevated from the orbicularis muscle except for its internal part where it is simply discarded so as not to compromise its vascularity; it is then rotated at 90° and inserted into a tunnel fitted in the subcutaneous plane down to the red lip corresponding to the restoration of the 2 philtral crests. Thus, all of the superior labial deformations observed over time (elongation and convexity of the white lip, flattening of the philtrum are corrected in a long lasting manner. The intervention is carried out under local anesthesia and, if necessary, the other elements of aging (loss of volume of the red lip, vertical wrinkles, defect of pigmentation etc.) can be corrected without risk at the same time.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Bile acid-induced liver injury is facilitated by necrotic cell death, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammation. Metformin, the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, is known to reduce not only blood glucose but also inflammatory responses. In this study, we investigated the effects of metformin on liver injury caused by cholestasis with bile acid-induced hepatocyte injury. Static bile acid-induced liver injury is thought to be related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammatory response, and chemokine expression. Metformin treatment reduced liver injury caused by bile acid, and it suppressed ER stress, inflammation, chemokine expression, and neutrophil infiltration. Similar results were obtained in mouse primary hepatocytes exposed to bile acid. Hepatocytes treated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid, an ER stress inhibitor, showed inhibition of ER stress, as well as reduced levels of inflammation and cell death. These results suggest that metformin may protect against liver injury by suppressing ER stress and inflammation and reducing chemokine expression.</AbstractText>"}

An inaccurate diagnosis impairs the well-being and the quality of life of patients and their relatives, as well as being a financial burden on the health system. Continued education pertaining to the neuropsychological field is uncommon for health workers involved in general practice. This article aims to present the process of development and content validity of the 'CENEES Program - Psychoeducation for Health Staff on The Neuropsychology of Aging'. The CENEES Program was developed in six steps which include: literature review, first draft, focal group, adjustments after focal group, judgment analysis (<i>n</i> = 4), and finally the last version. The inter-rater reliability index after judgment analysis was 0.785. The final version of the CENEES Program contains eight meetings, divided into 4 modules: 1) Fundamentals of Neuroscience; 2) Memory; 3) Executive Functions; and 4) Communication. The final meeting was called 'Review'. The CENEES Program is a new resource to help professionals who work within the general practice field, especially community health workers. As far as we know, there is no psychoeducation program on aging which contains the four subjects that are covered in the CENEES Program. The CENEES Program could assist the workers' daily activities and make them comfortable to offer and build actions in the community. A pilot and follow-up studies are suggested.</AbstractText>"}

Falls, fractures, and sarcopenia have a major impact on health in older adults, and they are interconnected by known risk factors. The link between osteoporosis, which is common in older adults, and the risk of falls is well known. Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, is also associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures because it reduces strength and leads to functional limitations. In addition to increasing the risk of falls, sarcopenia and osteoporosis can lead to frailty, reduced quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The conference highlighted the impact of bone and soft tissue disorders on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults. Presenters described factors that contribute to these disorders; health disparities experienced by various subpopulations; and promising biological, pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions to prevent or treat these disorders.

HIF-1 activation could be partly attributed to an increase in radical oxygen species and a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity. In addition, CGA exposition before thermal stress also increased autophagy just as hormetic heat condition (HHC), worms incubated at 36 °C for 1 h. RNAi experiments evidenced that autophagy was increased by CGA via HIF-1, heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 and heat-shock protein HSP-16 and HSP-70.

Accumulation of kynurenine in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) has been associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and differentiation, though the exact mechanism by which kynurenine mediates these changes is poorly understood. MiRNAs have been shown to regulate BMSC function, and accumulation of kynurenine may alter the miRNA expression profile of BMSCs. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in human BMSCs in response to treatment with kynurenine, and correlate miRNAs function in BMSCs biology through bioinformatics analysis. Human BMSCs were cultured and treated with and without kynurenine, and subsequent miRNA isolation was performed. MiRNA array was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNA. Microarray analysis identified 50 up-regulated, and 36 down-regulated miRNAs in kynurenine-treated BMSC cultures. Differentially expressed miRNA included miR-1281, miR-330-3p, let-7f-5p, and miR-493-5p, which are important for BMSC proliferation and differentiation. KEGG analysis found up-regulated miRNA targeting glutathione metabolism, a pathway critical for removing oxidative species.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the source, biological activity, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of aucubin with the ultimate objective of providing a guide for future drug development and potential clinical applications of aucubin. Aucubin is a highly active compound possessing extensive biological effects including antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and osteoprotective properties. Although aucubin has been shown to have poor oral bioavailability in rats, aucubin is widely distributed in multiple organs including kidney, liver, heart, spleen and lung, and there is a sex difference in the absorption of aucubin. Tolerance of aucubin is good and no serious adverse reactions have been observed to date. In short, aucubin is a compound with abundant potential sources, good safety and numerous beneficial biological activities, which exhibits high potential value for use in health care products and pharmaceuticals. In order to accelerate the development and utilization of aucubin-related products, in-depth studies should be focused on the following questions of interest. First, it is necessary to introduce advanced separation and formulation technologies to improve the yield and stability of aucubin products. Second, studies should focus on the specific pharmacological activities of aucubin to determine the structure-activity relationship so as to improve the efficacy and reduce side effects.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the pattern of age-related protein aggregation in human plasma using two distinct approaches: analysis with conformation-specific antibodies and FTIR spectroscopy. The latter has been widely used in biomedical research to study protein conformational changes in health and disease. Samples from a primary care based-cohort from the Aveiro region, Portugal, were used for slot-blot analyses followed by immunodetection with conformation-specific antibodies and for the acquisition of FTIR spectra. Immunoblot analyses revealed an age-dependent evolution of the protein conformational profile in human plasma, towards a decrease in prefibrillar oligomers and an increase in fibrillar structures. This finding was also supported by PLS-R multivariate analysis of FTIR data, where a positive correlation between the age of the donors and secondary structure of plasma proteins could be observed. Samples from younger donors are characterized by antiparallel β-sheet-containing structures while intermolecular β-sheets characterized older samples. Exclusion of age-associated co-morbidities improved the correlation between protein conformational profiles and aging. The results reveal structural changes in human plasma proteins from middle to old age, confirming the age-associated changes in protein aggregation, and support the applicability of FTIR as a reliable approach to study proteostasis during aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in cancer metastasis and skin aging. Regulation of various MMPs is closely associated with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including ERK, p38, and JNK MAPKs. In this study, we investigated the possibility of ursonic acid as an anti-cancer/anti-skin aging agent targeting MMPs. Cytotoxic effects of ursonic acid were analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Invasive abilities of ursonic acid-treated A549 and H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were tested with Boyden chamber assay. Effects of ursonic acid on MMPs were analyzed by zymography assays and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We also conducted flow cytometry and western blot analysis to elucidate the mechanisms of MMP regulation by ursonic acid. Our results revealed that ursonic acid inhibited transcriptional expression of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) via inhibition of ERK and CREB signaling pathways in NSCLC cells. Moreover, ursonic acid reduced mRNA levels of collagenase (MMP-1) via suppression of ERK and c-Fos signaling pathways in HaCaT keratinocytes. These results suggest that ursonic acid could be a potential candidate for development of an effective novel anti-cancer and anti-wrinkle agent.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One of the main metabolic features of tumor cells is the high level of glycolysis, even if there is oxygen. The transformation and preference of metabolic pathways is usually regulated by specific gene expression. The aim of this study is to develop a glycolysis-related risk signature as a biomarker via four common cancer types. Only hepatocellular carcinoma was shown the strong relationship with glycolysis. The mRNA sequencing and chip data of hepatocellular carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, renal clear cell carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma were included in the study. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed, profiling three glycolysis-related gene sets, it revealed genes associated with the biological process. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression models were used to screen out prognostic-related gene signature. We identified six mRNAs (DPYSL4, HOMER1, ABCB6, CENPA, CDK1, STMN1) significantly associated with overall survival in the Cox proportional regression model for hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on this gene signature, we were able to divide patients into high-risk and low-risk subgroups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that prognostic power of this six gene signature is independent of clinical variables. Further, we validated this data in our own 55 paired hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent tissues. The results showed that these proteins were highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent tissue. The survival time of high-risk group was significantly shorter than that of low-risk group, indicating that high-risk group had poor prognosis. We calculated the correlation coefficients between six proteins and found that these six proteins were independent of each other. In conclusions, we developed a glycolysis-related gene signature that could predict survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our findings provide novel insight to the mechanisms of glycolysis and it is useful for identifying patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with poor prognoses.</AbstractText>"}

Several studies suggested that MHO individuals were not at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-course mortality. However, whether MHO is associated with excess risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elders remains unclear. To explore the risk of AD among MHO phenotype and investigate whether MHO associates with neurodegenerative biomarkers of AD, we assessed body mass index-metabolic status phenotypes of 1199 longitudinal elders from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using the Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP- III) criteria. MHO subjects were at a significantly decreased risk for AD (adjusted HR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97) compared with metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) subjects. In multivariable linear regression models, the cross-sectional associations of MHO with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain Aβ load, and cortical structure were explored. MHO was positively correlated with CSF-Aβ (β=0.746, P=0.015), hippocampal volume (β=0.181, P=0.011), and whole brain volume (β=0.133, P=0.004).

In the current study, we investigated the dynamic changes in tau phosphorylation and their associations with the excitotoxicity induced by intraperitoneal injection of KA in the mouse brain. We found that KA-induced excitotoxicity led to sustained hyperphosphorylation of tau in MAPT transgenic (Tg) mice. By using cultured microglia and mouse brains, we showed that KA treatment specifically induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which was characterized by activation of the major biomarkers of ER, such as ATF6, GRP78, and IRE1, and resulted in stimulation of inflammasomes. KA receptors (KARs), such as Girk1, were determined to be involved in this KA-induced ER stress. ER stress was also shown to activate inflammasomes by stimulating the expression of the two major components of inflammasomes, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) protein 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and eventually causing the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Inhibition of NLRP3 or NF-κB by Bay11-7082 resulted in reduction of KA-induced IL-1β production. Our results also revealed the positive effects of IL-1β on tau phosphorylation, which was blocked by Bay11-7082. Notably, the results indicate that Bay11-7082 acts against KA-induced neuronal degeneration, tau phosphorylation, and memory defects via inflammasomes, which further highlight the protective role of Bay11-7082 in KA-induced neuronal defects.</AbstractText>"}

To date, several senescence routes have been identified, which play a fundamental role in development, tumor suppression and aging, among other processes. The positive and/or negative effects of senescent cells are directly related to the time that they remain in the organism. Short-term (acute) senescent cells are associated with positive effects; once they have executed their actions, immune cells are recruited to remove them. In contrast, long-term (chronic) senescent cells are associated with disease; they secrete pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic factors in a state known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In recent years, cellular senescence has become the center of attention for the treatment of aging-related diseases. Current therapies are focused on elimination of senescent cell functions in three main ways: i) use of senolytics; ii) inhibition of SASP; and iii) improvement of immune system functions against senescent cells (immunosurveillance). In addition, some anti-cancer therapies are based on the induction of senescence in tumor cells. However, these senescent-like cancer cells must be subsequently cleared to avoid a chronic pro-tumorigenic state. Here is a summary of different scenarios, depending on the therapy used, with a discussion of the pros and cons of each scenario.</AbstractText>"}

T1-weighted longitudinal 3T MRI data (up to four follow-up assessments) from neuropsychologically well-characterized advanced PD patients (n = 172, 8.9 years disease duration) and healthy elderly controls (n = 85) enrolled in the LANDSCAPE study were longitudinally analyzed using a linear mixed effect model and atlas-based volumetry and cortical thickness measures. At baseline, PD patients presented with cerebral atrophy and cortical thinning including striatum, temporoparietal regions, and primary/premotor cortex. The atrophy was already observed in 'cognitively normal' PD patients (PD-N) and was considerably more pronounced in cognitively impaired PD patients. Linear mixed effect modeling revealed almost similar rates of atrophy change in PD and controls. The group comparison at baseline between those PD-N whose cognitive performance remained stable (n = 42) and those PD-N patients who converted to MCI/PDD ('converter' cPD-N, n = 26) indicated suggested cortical thinning in the anterior cingulate cortex in cPD-N patients which was correlated with cognitive performance. Our results suggest that cortical brain atrophy has been already expanded in advanced PD patients without overt cognitive deficits while atrophy progression in late disease did not differ from 'normal' aging regardless of the cognitive status. It appears that cortical atrophy begins early and progresses already in the initial disease stages emphasizing the need for therapeutic interventions already at disease onset.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The worldwide incidence has remained stable during the last 25 years, while both mortality and percentage of patients who died have declined by 36% and 40%, respectively. The incidence of CO poisoning does not differ between sexes, whilst mortality is double in men. The incidence shows two apparent peaks, between 0-14 years and 20-39 years. The percentage of patients who died constantly increases in parallel with aging, peaking in patients aged 80 years or older. The number of CO poisoning grows in parallel with the socio-demographic index (SDI), though more detailed analyses would be needed to confirm our findings. Mortality displays a similar trend, being approximately 2.1- and 3.6-fold higher in middle and middle-to-high than in low-to-middle SDI countries. In conclusion, while these data suggest that the worldwide burden of CO poisoning remains stable, and the number of fatal outcomes and percentage of patients who die have both consistently declined during the last 25 years, the unreliability of the primary data sources in many countries with respect to accurate diagnosis of CO poisoning means that caution is required, and that field studies, particularly in poorer countries, are required.</AbstractText>"}

The loss of mitochondria in the senescent human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells has knock-on consequences for nutrient usage, metabolism and function.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to both cellular senescence and aging; however, it is still unclear whether mitochondria play a causal role in senescence.

The objective of this study was to compare frontal lobe electroencephalography activity and brainstem reflexes during intravenous induction of general anaesthesia, in patients receiving a typical bolus dose (fast infusion) of propofol compared with a slower infusion rate. We sought to determine whether brainstem suppression ('bottom-up') predominates over loss of cortical function ('top-down'). Sixteen ASA physical status-1 patients were randomly assigned to either a fast or slow propofol infusion group. Loss of consciousness and brainstem reflexes were assessed every 30 s by a neurologist blinded to treatment allocation. We performed a multitaper spectral analysis of all electroencephalography data obtained from each participant. Brainstem reflexes were present in all eight patients in the slow infusion group, while being absent in all patients in the fast infusion group, at the moment of loss of consciousness (p = 0.010). An increase in alpha band power was observed before loss of consciousness only in participants allocated to the slow infusion group. Alpha band power emerged several minutes after the loss of consciousness in participants allocated to the fast infusion group. Our results show a predominance of 'bottom-up' mechanisms during fast infusion rates and 'top-down' mechanisms during slow infusion rates. The underlying mechanisms by which propofol induces loss of consciousness are potentially influenced by the speed of infusion.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Association of Anaesthetists.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Traditional methods to investigate gene expression relationships rely on using bulk, pooled-population assays (e.g. RNA-sequencing and RT-PCR) to compare gene expression levels in hypo- or hyper-morphic mutant animals (e.g. gain-of-function or knockout). This approach is limited, especially in complex gene networks, as these genetic mutations may affect the expressions of related genes in unforseen ways. In contrast, we developed a microfluidic-based pipeline to discover gene relationships in a single genetic background. The microfluidic device provides efficient reagent exchange and the ability to track individual animals. By automating a robust microfluidic reagent exchange strategy, we adapted and validated single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) on-chip and combined this technology with live-imaging of fluorescent transcriptional reporters. Together, this multi-level information enabled us to quantify a gene expression relationship with single-animal resolution. While this microfluidic-based pipeline is optimized for live-imaging and smFISH C. elegans studies, the strategy is highly-adaptable to other biological models as well as combining other live and end-point biological assays, such as behavior-based toxicology screening and immunohistochemistry.</AbstractText>"}

Owing to their good solubility in common organic solvents, the products were fully characterized using chromatographic, spectroscopic, thermal, and morphological techniques and used as single materials in the photoactive layers of organic solar cells. The photoconversion efficiencies obtained with copolymers were compared with those of a reference cell prepared using a physical blend of the precursor homopolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester. The best results were obtained with COP2, the copolymer with a 21% molar content of C<sub>60</sub>-functionalized side chains. The use of the double-cable polymer made possible an enhanced control on the nanomorphology of the active blend, thus reducing phase-segregation phenomena as well as the macroscale separation between the electron-acceptor and -donor components, yielding a power conversion efficiency higher than that of the reference cell (4.05 vs 3.68%). Moreover, the presence of the halogen group was exploited for the photo-cross-linking of the active layer immediately after the thermal annealing procedure. The cross-linked samples showed an increased stability over time, leading to good efficiencies even after 120 h of accelerated aging: this was a key feature for the widespread practical applicability of the prepared devices.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, e.g., collagen, arises as an important contributor and accelerator in this process. Existing methods to detect collagen degradation at the tissue level include histology and immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, most of these methods only depict overall collagen content without the ability to specifically discern degraded collagen and to assess the severity of degeneration. To fill this technological gap, we developed a robust and simple approach to detect and assess early disc degeneration with a collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) that hybridizes with the flawed triple helix structure in degraded collagen. Intriguingly, the CHP signal in mouse lumbar discs exhibited a linear incremental pattern with age. This finding was corroborated with histological analysis based on established methods. When comparing this analysis, a positive linear correlation was found between CHP fluorescence intensity and the histological score with a regression value of <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9478. In degenerative mouse discs elicited by pro-inflammatory stimuli (IL-1<i>β</i> and LPS) <i>ex vivo</i>, the newly developed approach empowered prediction of the severity of disc degeneration. We further demonstrated higher CHP signals in a degenerative human disc tissue when compared to a normal sample. These findings also resonated with histological analysis. This approach lays a solid foundation for specific detection and assessment of intervertebral disc degeneration at the molecular level and will promote development of future disc regeneration strategies.</AbstractText>"}

Repetitive double (D)-TBI (two months after the S-TBI at a dose of 5Gy) further weakened HSPC function via mitochondrial ROS accumulation and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. Oral administration of CA (20 mg/kg) five times before and once immediately after TBI ameliorated ROS generation and TBI-induced HSC senescence and its radioprotective effect was long lasting in S-TBI mice but not in D-TBI mice.

To systematically evaluate whether incretin-based therapies may lead to dizziness and headache in patients with T2DM compared to other traditional antidiabetic drugs or placebo. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception through June 23, 2017, to identify randomized controlled trials of the safety of DPP-4Is or GLP-1 RAs versus placebo or other antidiabetic drugs in T2DM patients.

Thus, it is urgently to establish sensitive and non-invasive biomarkers for AD diagnosis, particularly in the early stage. Recently, emerging number of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered as effective biomarkers in various diseases as they possess characteristics of stable, resistant to RNAase digestion and many extreme conditions in circulatory fluid. This review highlights recent advances in the identification of the aberrantly expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in circulatory network for detection of AD. We summarized the abnormal expressed miRNAs in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and detailed discussed the functions and molecular mechanism of serum or plasma miRNAs-miR-195, miR-155, miR-34a, miR-9, miR-206, miR-125b and miR-29 in the regulation of AD progression. In addition, we also elaborated the role of circulating lncRNA major including beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and its antisense lncRNA BACE1-AS in AD pathological advancement. In brief, confirming the aberrantly expressed circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs will provide an effective testing tools for treatment of AD in the future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Zhao et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim of this study was to perform a narrative review on the preventative, and mitigating, effects of physical activity on AD onset, including genetic factors, mechanism of action and physical activity typology. In this article, we conducted a narrative review of the influence physical activity and exercise have on AD, utilising key terms related to AD, physical activity, mechanism and prevention, searching the online databases; Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar, and, subsequently, discuss possible mechanisms of this action. On the basis of this review, it is evident that physical activity and exercise may be incorporated in AD, notwithstanding, a greater number of high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed, moreover, physical activity typology must be acutely considered, primarily due to a dearth of research on the efficacy of physical activity types other than aerobic.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Gronek et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We identified 165,461 DKD patients from the Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients in Taiwan (n=840,000) between 2004 and 2010, classifying them into those without frailty or with 1, 2 and ≥3 frailty components based on a modified version of FRAIL scale. Using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we examined the long-term risk of developing ESRD along with their risk of mortality, supplemented by a competing risk analysis against mortality. Among all participants, 66.2% (n=109,586), 27.2% (n=44,986), 5.9% (n=9,799), and 0.7% (n=1090) patients did not have or had 1, 2, and ≥3 frailty components, respectively. After a 4.1-year follow-up, 4.2% patients developed ESRD and 18.5% died. Cox proportional hazard modeling revealed that patients with 1, 2, and ≥3 frailty components had increased risks of developing ESRD (for 1, 2, and ≥3 components, hazard ratio [HR] 1.13, 1.18, and 1.2, respectively) and mortality (HR 1.25, 1.41, and 1.34, respectively), with. 9% and 16% risk elevations for ESRD and mortality per component increase. Competing risk analysis showed that frailty-induced ESRD risk was attenuated partially by mortality in those with moderate frailty. The receipt of palliative care did not attenuate this risk.

The five-minute cognitive test (FCT) was designed to capture deficits in five domains of cognitive abilities, including episodic memory, language fluency, time orientation, visuospatial function, and executive function. Subsequently, FCT efficiencies in differentiating normally cognitive ability from cognitive impairment were explored and compared with that of the Mini-Mental Status Evaluation (MMSE). Equipercentile equating method was utilized to create a crosswalk between scores of the FCT and MMSE. Further, the association of scores of the FCT and MMSE with hippocampal volumes was investigated. There were 241 subjects aged 60 years or above enrolled in this study, including 107 adults with cognitive abilities in normal range, 107 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 27 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD). The AUC of FCT for detection of cognitive impairment (MCI and mild AD) was 0.885 (95% CI 0.838 to 0.922). The sensitivity and specificity of FCT for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment were 80.6% and 84.11 %, respectively. FCT's diagnostic performance was superior to that of MMSE in the same cohort. Mean completion time of FCT was 339.9 ± 67.7 seconds (5-6 min). In addition, a conversion table between scores on the FCT and MMSE was created. Further, the FCT scores were positively correlated with hippocampal volumes. The FCT is a novel, reliable, and valid cognitive screening test for the detection of dementia at early stages.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Zhang et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study explored sex and urban-rural differences in disability transitions and life expectancies among older adults in China. Data were collected from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS), which enrolled people aged 65 and older and was conducted in randomly selected counties and cities across 22 provinces in China. Disability was diagnosed based on basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Several individual characteristics were assessed, including sociodemographic factors (age, sex and region, etc.) and health behaviors (currently smoking, currently drinking, etc.). Multistate models were applied to analyze the transition rates among 4 states: no disability, mild disability, severe disability and death. The transition rates from disabled states to the no-disability state were found to decrease markedly with age. The rates of recovery from mild disability in rural areas were higher than those in urban areas. Rural elderly individuals lived shorter lives than their urban counterparts, but they tended to live with better functional status, spending a larger fraction of their remaining life with less severe disability. Based on these findings, devoting more attention and resources to rural areas may help less severely disabled people recuperate and prevent severe disability. The study provides insights into health plan strategies to help guide the allocation of limited resources.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Hou et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In current study, we found that db/db mice display cognitive decline with inferior learning and memory function. The accumulation of β-amyloid<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>), which is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), was markedly higher in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cornu ammon1 (CA1), and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus in db/db mice. Moreover, BDNF and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) levels were lower in the hippocampus of db/db mice. However, there was no noticeable differences in the level of apoptosis in the hippocampus between control (CON) mice and db/db mice. Markers of autophagy in the hippocampus were elevated in db/db mice. The expression levels of ATG5, ATG7, and LC3B were higher, and the level of P62 was lower. An autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, and ATG7 siRNA significantly reversed the activation of autophagy <i>in vitro</i>, which was accompanied with a higher level of apoptosis. Taken together, our current study suggests that diabetes is associated with cognitive decline, and activation of autophagy has a neuroprotective role in DACD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Wu et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Structural MRI data of 237 early, drug-naive non-demented PD patients (classified as 61 PD-MCI and 176 PD-NC) and 69 HCs were included from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database after data quality control. Within these data, a subset of 61 HCs and a subset of 61 PD-NC who were matched to the 61 PD-MCI group for age, gender, and education-level were selected to further eliminate the sample size effect. The gray matter (GM) volume changes between groups were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, correlations between GM volume alterations and neuropsychological performances and non-cognitive assessments (including olfactory performance) were further examined. Compared to HC, patients with PD-NC and PD-MCI commonly exhibited atrophies in the bilateral amygdala (AM) and the left primary motor cortex (M1). Patients with PD-MCI exclusively exhibited atrophy in the right entorhinal cortex (ENT) compared to PD-NC. Significantly negative correlations were found between GM loss in the bilateral AM and olfactory performance in all PD patients, and between ENT loss and memory performance in PD-MCI. The findings suggest that the right ENT atrophy may subserve as a biomarker in early, drug-naive PD-MCI, which shed light on the neural underpinnings of the disease and provide new evidence on differentiating the neuroanatomical states between PD-MCI and PD-NC.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Jia et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, our study shows that APS could significantly extend adult stage, mean, and maximum lifespan of the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i> and increase body weight without affecting food intake and fecundity. Meanwhile, the activities of glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase are significantly enhanced, and the reaction oxygen species content is reduced concomitantly. Moreover, the activity of lysozyme is increased dramatically. In addition, APS rescues the shortened lifespan by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> infection in silkworm. Furthermore, the transcription of the crucial genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress is upregulated upon the endoplasmic reticulum stress stimulation. APS also significantly ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress in silkworm cell line and in vivo. Together, the results of this study indicate that APS can prolong the silkworm lifespan by mitigating endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Lymphocyte-specific kinase (Lck) is a positive regulator of inflammatory signaling and a potential treatment target for age-related diseases, but its role in leptin signaling is unknown. Here, we investigated how Lck influences hyperleptinemia-induced inflammation in kidney tissues from 6- and 21-month-old rats. Results indicate that Lck expression and activation increased significantly in aged rat kidneys, especially at renal tubules. Furthermore, we identified interactions between Lck and short leptin-receptor isoforms, suggesting that Lck is a protein tyrosine kinase regulating leptin signaling. We further investigated whether increased Lck expression in renal tubular epithelial cells and macrophage infiltration are associated with leptin-induced inflammation. We then demonstrated that leptin activates Lck and proinflammatory transcription factors (STAT3 and NF-κB), while Lck knockdown modulates the expression of both transcription factors. Collectively, these data implicate that Lck leads to development of leptin-induced renal inflammation during aging. Inhibition of this protein tyrosine kinase may therefore be an appropriate therapeutic option for protection against age-related hyperleptinemia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © 2019 Kim et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, we present the application of the Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome approach to profile gene expression in single laser captured neurons as well as pooled 10 and 100 neurons from hippocampal CA1 of AD brains versus matching normal aged brains. Our results demonstrated the high sensitivity and high genome coverage of the AmpliSeq transcriptome in single cell sequencing. In addition to capturing the known changes related to AD, our data confirmed the diversity of neuronal profiles in AD brain, which allow the potential identification of single cell response that might be hidden in population analyses. Notably, we also revealed the extensive inhibition of olfactory signaling and confirmed the reduction of neurotransmitter receptors in AD hippocampus. We conclude that although single neuron data show more variance than data from 10 or 100 pooled neurons, single neuron data can be informative.

To accomplish our goals, we conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray expression data. Our inclusion criteria included subjects with influenza, subjects who received the influenza vaccine and healthy controls. We curated 18 microarray datasets for a total of 3,481 samples (1,277 controls, 297 influenza infection, 1,907 influenza vaccination). We pre-processed the raw microarray expression data in R using packages available to pre-process Affymetrix and Illumina microarray platforms. We used a Box-Cox power transformation of the data prior to our down-stream analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. Statistical analyses were based on linear mixed effects model with all study factors and successive likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to identify differentially-expressed genes. We filtered LRT results by disease (Bonferroni adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and used a two-tailed 10% quantile cutoff to identify biologically significant genes. Furthermore, we assessed age and sex effects on the disease genes by filtering for genes with a statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) interaction between disease and age, and disease and sex. We identified 4,889 statistically significant genes when we filtered the LRT results by disease factor, and gene enrichment analysis (gene ontology and pathways) included innate immune response, viral process, defense response to virus, Hematopoietic cell lineage and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our quantile filtered gene lists comprised of 978 genes each associated with influenza infection and vaccination.

The predominant classical dimer RelA:p50 is presumed to operate as 'NF-κB' in many contexts. However, there are several other dimer species which exist and may even be more functionally relevant in specific cell types. Accurate characterization of stimulus-specific and tissue-specific dimer repertoires is fundamentally important for understanding the downstream gene regulation by NF-κB proteins. <i>In vitro</i> assays such as immunoprecipitation have been widely used to analyze subunit composition, but these methods do not provide information about dimerization status within the natural intracellular environment of intact live cells. Here we apply a live single cell microscopy technique termed Number and Brightness to examine dimers translocating to the nucleus in fibroblasts after pro-inflammatory stimulation. This quantitative assay suggests that RelA:RelA homodimers are more prevalent than might be expected. We also found that the relative proportion of RelA:RelA homodimers can be perturbed by small molecule inhibitors known to disrupt the NF-κB pathway.

Antiphagocytic protein 1 (App1), and laccase enzymes (Lac1 and Lac2) are virulence factors known to contribute to virulence of <i>C. neoformans</i> during infection through inhibition of phagocytic uptake and melanization. Here we show that these cell-wall-associated proteins are not only significantly upregulated in old <i>C. neoformans</i> cells, but also that their upregulation likely contributes to the increased resistance to antifungal and host-mediated killing during infection and to the subsequent accumulation of old cells. We found that old cells melanize to a greater extent than younger cells and as a consequence, old melanized cells are more resistant to killing by amphotericin B compared to young melanized cells. A decrease in melanization of old <i>lac</i>Δ mutants lead to a decrease in old-cell resilience, indicating that age-related melanization is contributing to the overall resilience of older cells and is being mediated by laccase genes. Additionally, we found that older cells are more resistant to macrophage phagocytosis, but this resistance is lost when <i>APP1</i> is knocked out, indicating that upregulation of <i>APP1</i> in older cells is in part responsible for their increased resistance to phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, infections with old cells in the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model support our conclusions, as loss of the <i>APP1, LAC1</i>, and <i>LAC2</i> gene ablates the enhanced virulence of old cells, indicating their importance in age-dependent resilience.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Orner, Bhattacharya, Kalenja, Hayden, Del Poeta and Fries.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The aim of this study was to first operate a new computerized tool, designed to monitor divers' wellbeing and cognitive function, and to record the results. The second aim was to evaluate the feasibility and validity of the Physiopad software and HPNS questionnaires as a new tool for monitoring divers wellbeing in an operational setting, including sensible visualization and presentation of results. <b>Methods:</b> The Physiopad was operated onboard Deep Arctic (TechnipFMC Diving Support Vessel). The diving work was performed between 180 and 207 msw. The data from 46 divers were collected from the HPNS questionnaires, Hand dynamometry test, Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency test (CFFF), Adaptive Visual Analog Scale (AVAS), Simple Math Process (MathProc test), Perceptual Vigilance Task (PVT), and Time Estimation Task (time-wall). <b>Result:</b> Diver's subjective evaluation revealed different symptoms, possibly also HPNS related, which lasted from 1 to 5 days in storage, with the common duration being 1 day. The results from Physiopad battery testing showed no signs of significant neurological alteration. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present study showed that there was no association between subjective measurements of HPNS and neuropsychometric test results. We also confirmed the feasibility of using the computerized test battery to monitor saturation divers at work. The HPNS battery and Physiopad software could be an important tool for monitoring diver's health in the future. This tool was not used during the Bahr Essalam project to operationally evaluate any HPNS effect on divers as data analysis was performed post-project.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Berenji Ardestani, Balestra, Bouzinova, Loennechen and Pedersen.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This pathological condition has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of central encephalopathies and peripheral neuropathies. In further support of this notion, recent epidemiological evidence suggests a link between DM and Parkinson's disease (PD), with hyperglycemia emerging as one of the culprits in neurodegeneration involving the nigrostriatal pathway, the neuroanatomical substrate of the motor symptoms affecting parkinsonian patients. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons located in the mesencephalic substantia nigra appear to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and degeneration, likely because of their intrinsic susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction, which may represent a direct consequence of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Other pathological pathways induced by increased intracellular glucose levels, including the polyol and the hexosamine pathway as well as the formation of advanced glycation end-products, may all play a pivotal role in mediating the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on nigral dopaminergic neurons. In this review article, we will examine the epidemiological as well as the molecular and cellular clues supporting the potential susceptibility of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons to hyperglycemia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Sergi, Renaud, Simola and Martinoli.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is unclear how corticostriatal connectivity relates to the recovery process of patients with BP. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between longitudinal changes of caudate-based functional connectivity and longitudinal changes of facial performance in patients with intractable BP. Twenty-one patients with intractable BP underwent resting-state fMRI as well as facial behavioral assessments prior to treatment (PT) and at the middle stage of treatment (MT); and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited and received the same protocol. The caudate was divided into dorsal and ventral sub-regions and separate functional connectivity was calculated. Compared with HC, patients with intractable BP at the PT stage showed decreased functional connectivity of both the dorsal and ventral caudate mainly distributed in the somatosensory network, including the bilateral precentral gyrus (MI), left postcentral gyrus, media frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Alternatively, patients in the MT stage showed decreased functional connectivity primarily distributed in the executive network and somatosensory network, including the bilateral cingulate cortex (CC), left anterior cingulate cortex (LACC), inferior prefrontal gyrus (IFG), MI, STG, and paracentral lobe. The longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of both the dorsal and ventral caudate were mainly observed in the executive network, including the right ACC, left CC, and IFG. Functional connectivity changes in the right ACC and left IFG were significantly correlated with changes in facial behavioral performance. These findings indicated that corticostriatal connectivity changes are associated with recovery from BP.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Hu, Kan, Kan, Li, Yuan, Xu, Wang, Wang, Bao, Shen and Wu.</CopyrightInformation>"}

YKSCH comprises YKS and two additional herbs, a chimpi and a hange, and is used to treat digestive function deficiencies. However, the differences between the effects of YKS and YKSCH on brain function are unclear. The present study examined the effects of YKS and YKSCH on aggressive behavior in mice reared under a social isolation (SI) condition. Mice were housed individually for 6 weeks. YKS and YKSCH were administered orally for 2 weeks before aggression tests. SI increased aggressive behavior against naïve mice, and YKS, but not YKSCH, significantly attenuated this aggressive behavior. Because serotonin (5-HT)<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor antagonists are reported to have anti-aggressive effects, the mRNA levels of these receptors were examined. YKS attenuated the SI-induced increase in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor mRNA in the amygdala. On the other hand, YKSCH attenuated the SI-induced increase in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor mRNA. YKS and YKSCH did not affect 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content in the amygdala. However, YKSCH increased the mRNA level of arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is a neuropeptide that has been implicated in aggression, in the amygdala. These results suggest that YKS ameliorates aggressive behavior by decreasing 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor expression. The YKSCH-induced increase in AVP may disrupt the anti-aggressive effect of YKS. YKS may be more effective than YKSCH for treating irritability if digestive function deficiencies are not considered.</AbstractText>"}

Individuals with DS are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like dementia, with up to 75% of DS people in their 60s developing dementia. Oxidative stress is widely accepted as a mechanism underlying a number of DS symptoms, such as accelerated aging and cognitive decline. Superoxide disumutase 1 (Sod1) and amiloyd precursor protein (App) genes are suggested as the candidate genes in HSA21 underlying the enhanced oxidative stress in individuals with DS. However, we previously demonstrated that the Ts1Cje mouse model, which has a normal copy number of both candidate genes, also shows enhanced oxidative stress, suggesting that triplicated genes other than Sod1 and App likely enhance oxidative stress in the brain of DS people. To identify the molecules with enhanced oxidative stress in Ts1Cje mice, we performed several -omics analyses. Recently, we showed that copper was accumulated in the brain of adult Ts1Cje mice in an analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and a low-copper diet was able to improve the elevated levels of copper. The low-copper diet also resolved some anomalies, such as the enhanced oxidative stress, accumulation of phosphorylated tau and low anxiety. These findings suggest that the accumulation of copper in the DS brain may be a therapeutic target for ameliorating a number of abnormal phenotypes in individuals with DS.</AbstractText>"}

A decrease in the skin barrier function, involving immunocompetent mast cells and oxidative stress, was noted in indomethacin-induced small intestine inflammation, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis, and azoxymethane+DSS-induced colorectal cancer. A possible correlation was found to exist between inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases and the skin, and this correlation was investigated using a rheumatoid arthritis model as representative of inflammatory diseases. Similar to previously reported results, deterioration of the skin barrier function was observed, and new information was obtained by analyzing changes in inflammatory markers in the blood and skin tissues.

We analyzed demographic and clinical data of all patients (pts) with 18 years or older with pneumonia requiring hospitalization registered on the national health service registry of mainland Portugal over 2015. A total of 36366 patients corresponding to 40696 pneumonia hospital admissions in 2015 were analyzed. Most of the patients were very old (median age 80 years). Hospital mortality for pneumonia was higher among older (30,3% pts&gt;75 years). Pneumococcus is the more frequent bacterial isolate, reaching 41.2% of the isolates of total pneumonia cases. The frequency of pneumococcus decreases with aging; conversely, gram-negative bacteria and staphylococcus increase. Pneumococcus is more frequently identified in the winter, closely related to influenza outbreaks. Gram-negative bacteria are more prevalent during the summer months. Diabetes, obesity, COPD, and tobacco smoking are not associated with an increased risk of dying from pneumonia. Patients older than 75 years; living in a senior house; or with chronic renal disease, lung cancer, metastatic disease, mobility impairment, cachexia, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease are at greater risk of dying from pneumonia.

These factors can be grouped into six categories: core resilience, spirituality, control, optimism, emotion and self-related resilience. They are associated with a better adjustment to menopausal symptoms, milder physical symptoms, a better quality of and satisfaction with life, better well-being, less perceived stress and fewer depressive symptoms compared with women with lower levels of the respective resilience factors. Our conceptual framework includes resilience factors which have already been verified by empirical data. Further research is needed to determine whether these resilience factors can be assigned to a common factor and to incorporate biological resilience markers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Non-pathogenic sequence variation among mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes influences traits including fertility, healthspan and lifespan, whereas pathogenic mutations are linked to incurable mitochondrial diseases and other complex conditions like ageing, diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration. However, we know very little about how mtDNA genetic variation contributes to phenotypic differences. Infrequent recombination, the multicopy nature and nucleic acid-impenetrable membranes present significant challenges that hamper our ability to precisely map mtDNA variants responsible for traits, and to genetically modify mtDNA so that we can isolate specific mutants and characterize their biochemical and physiological consequences. Here, we summarize the past struggles and efforts in developing systems to map and edit mtDNA. We also assess the future of performing forward and reverse genetic studies on animal mitochondrial genomes.

Series B, Biological sciences","Date":"Jan 20 2020","Keywords":"mitochondrial DNA, pleiotropy, rate of living, sex specific selective sieve, sexual conflict, sexually antagonistic selection","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Evolutionary theory proposes that maternal inheritance of mitochondria will facilitate the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that are harmful to males but benign or beneficial to females. Furthermore, mtDNA haplotypes sampled from across a given species distribution are expected to differ in the number and identity of these 'male-harming' mutations they accumulate. Consequently, it is predicted that the genetic variation which delineates distinct mtDNA haplotypes of a given species should confer larger phenotypic effects on males than females (reflecting mtDNA mutations that are male-harming, but female-benign), or sexually antagonistic effects (reflecting mutations that are male-harming, but female-benefitting). These predictions have received support from recent work examining mitochondrial haplotypic effects on adult life-history traits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Here, we explore whether similar signatures of male-bias or sexual antagonism extend to a key physiological trait-metabolic rate. We measured the effects of mitochondrial haplotypes on the amount of carbon dioxide produced by individual flies, controlling for mass and activity, across 13 strains of <i>D. melanogaster</i> that differed only in their mtDNA haplotype. The effects of mtDNA haplotype on metabolic rate were larger in males than females. Furthermore, we observed a negative intersexual correlation across the haplotypes for metabolic rate. Finally, we uncovered a male-specific negative correlation, across haplotypes, between metabolic rate and longevity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal mitochondrial inheritance has led to the accumulation of a sex-specific genetic load within the mitochondrial genome, which affects metabolic rate and that may have consequences for the evolution of sex differences in life history.

Series B, Biological sciences","Date":"Jan 20 2020","Keywords":"fecundity, life-history trade-off, longevity, mitonuclear interactions, nutrition, resource allocation","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Mitochondria are central to both energy metabolism and biosynthesis. Mitochondrial function could therefore influence resource allocation. Critically, mitochondrial function depends on interactions between proteins encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Severe incompatibilities between these genomes can have pervasive effects on both fitness and longevity. How milder deficits in mitochondrial function affect life-history trade-offs is less well understood. Here, we analyse how mitonuclear interactions affect the trade-off between fecundity and longevity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We consider a panel of 10 different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes against two contrasting nuclear backgrounds (<i>w</i><sup>1118</sup> (WE) and Zim53 (ZIM)) in response to high-protein versus standard diet. We report strikingly different responses between the two nuclear backgrounds. WE females have higher fecundity and decreased longevity on high protein. ZIM females have much greater fecundity and shorter lifespan than WE flies on standard diet. High protein doubled their fecundity with no effect on longevity. Mitochondrial haplotype reflected nuclear life-history trade-offs, with a negative correlation between longevity and fecundity in WE flies and no correlation in ZIM flies. Mitonuclear interactions had substantial effects but did not reflect genetic distance between mitochondrial haplotypes. We conclude that mitonuclear interactions can have significant impact on life-history trade-offs, but their effects are not predictable by relatedness.

The questions about whether, and to what extent, people with aphasia (PWA) present deficits on different executive functions (EFs) is relatively understudied.<i>Method:</i> In this study, four EFs, set-switching, updating, inhibition, and dual task processing were evaluated in aphasia and healthy groups. Three groups of participants: 30 healthy young, 30 healthy old, and 10 PWA were assessed on four tasks, Colour Trails Test (CTT 1 and 2), Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPT II), n-back (1- and 2-back), and divided attention task that tapped into different EFs. In order to examine performance differences on the EF tasks between the participant groups, repeated measures and multivariate analysis of variances with follow-up pairwise comparisons were computed. Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted to evaluate the strength and direction of the association between aphasia severity (on Western Aphasia Battery-Revised) and executive functioning.<i>Result:</i> PWA demonstrated significantly diminished performance on all EF tasks in comparison to healthy groups and differences were distinct on the higher-level complexity tasks such as the 2-back and CTT 2. The healthy older group demonstrated elevated response times on the CTT, CPT II, and divided attention tasks, and decreased sensitivity scores on the CPT II and n-back in comparison to the younger group. Also, aphasia severity correlated with reduced performance on selective EF measures.<i>Conclusion:</i> This study emphasises the importance of investigating EF deficits in PWA and its potential relationship to language behaviour.

The commonly used methods for peroxynitrite preparation in vitro usually contain high concentration of sodium hydroxide, which easily induces hydrolysis of target proteins. Accordingly, the method for peroxynitrite preparation was optimized in vitro by changing the sequence of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide added. After different amount of hydrochloric acid added to the system following sodium nitrite, peroxynitrite can be yielded in a concentration up to 60 mM with sodium hydroxide as low as 17 mM.

Mild stress of dietary restriction (DR) is often beneficial by extending longevity in many organisms. Here, DR-induced effects on longevity were tested for genetic variation in a set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) in D. melanogaster. Genetic variability was significant in the longevity response following a DR-treatment across RIL, with detrimental effects in several RIL but beneficial effects in other RIL. One quantitative trait locus (QTL) was consistently significant in the middle of chromosome 2 for DR-induced changes in longevity, including hormesis (an increase in longevity by DR). Another QTL co-localized with a previously found QTL for starvation resistance in females. Several other QTL were also significant on most chromosomal arms. Longevity in controls was negatively correlated to DR effects across RIL for longevity in females, the sex showing higher DR-induced hormesis. This negative genetic correlation highlights the importance to further investigate the effects of genetic variation in the strength of DR-induced hormesis in longevity and its sex-specificity.</AbstractText>"}

This study investigated the possibility of using the adhesive layer as a chlorhexidine modified release system evaluating their impact on the properties of these systems as well as evaluating the impact of these systems on immediate and post-aging dentin adhesion. Were used a matrix with BisGMA, UDMA, HEMA and TEGDMA copolymer and clay particles (Dellite 67G); associated with a chlorhexidine and a camphorquinone photoinitiator system. The properties of these systems were evaluated by the XRD, FTIR spectrophotometer, flexural strength, elasticity modulus, drug release, enzymatic inhibition and dentin adhesion resistance. The presence of the clay can raise the mechanical properties of the adhesive systems engendering a more resistant hybrid layer and led to a more sustained release of chlorhexidine in the systems, allowing a longer effective period of MMP-2 inhibition. The hypothesis that the addition of clays as release modulators could increase the effectiveness of these drugs in inhibiting the dentin's MPPs and consequently enhancing the adhesive durability was confirmed. These results indicate that the controlled release of chlorhexidine is able to reduce the process of loss of adhesion presenting itself as a promising system to increase the longevity of dental restorations.</AbstractText>"}

Due to the critical role of this RNA endonuclease in the suppression of inflammation, Mcpip1 deficiency in mice leads to the development of postnatal multiorgan inflammation and premature death. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of Mcpip1 in the epidermis (Mcpip1<sup>EKO</sup>). Mcpip1 loss in keratinocytes resulted in the upregulated expression of transcripts encoding factors related to inflammation and keratinocyte differentiation, such as IL-36α/γ cytokines, S100a8/a9 antibacterial peptides, and Sprr2d/2h proteins. Upon aging, the Mcpip1<sup>EKO</sup> mice showed impaired skin integrity that led to the progressive development of spontaneous skin pathology and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, we found that the lack of epidermal Mcpip1 expression impaired the balance of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Overall, we provide evidence that keratinocyte-specific Mcpip1 activity is crucial for the maintenance of skin integrity as well as for the prevention of excessive local and systemic inflammation. KEY MESSAGES: Loss of murine epidermal Mcpip1 upregulates transcripts related to inflammation and keratinocyte differentiation. Keratinocyte Mcpip1 function is essential to maintain the integrity of skin in adult mice.

However, the role of statins in the treatment of diabetes-related depression has not been well examined. Herein, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin on depressive behaviors and neuroinflammation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Our data indicated that oral administration of atorvastatin at 10 or 20 mg/kg for 3 weeks markedly ameliorated diabetes-associated depressive behaviors reflected by better performance in sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), and novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT). The study further showed that atrovastatin decreased the expression of nucleus NF-κB p65 expression and ameliorated neuroinflammatory responses in prefrontal cortex as evidenced by less Iba-1-positive cells and lower inflammatory mediators including IL-1β and TNF-α. As expected, atorvastatin-treated diabetic mice exhibited significant improvement of hyperlipidemia rather than hyperglycemia.

Mobile element activation is repressed to avoid deleterious effects, such as gene mutations or chromosome rearrangements. Control of transposable elements includes a variety of mechanisms comprising silencing pathways, which are based on the production of small non-coding RNAs. Silencing can occur either through transposable element RNA degradation or through the targeting of DNA sequences by heterochromatin formation and consequent transcriptional inhibition. Since the important role of the heterochromatin silencing, the gradual loss of heterochromatin marks in constitutive heterochromatin regions during the aging process promotes derepression of transposable elements, which is considered a cause of the progressive increase in genomic instability and of the activation of inflammatory responses. This review provides an overview of the effects of heterochromatin loss on the activity of transposable elements during the aging process and the possible impact on genome function.

Kynurenine is now known to signal through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to modulate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The Ahr promoter region contains several sites for NF-kB binding, indicating that inflammation is a key factor modulating Ahr expression. Furthermore, kynurenine activation of Ahr is observed to stimulate expression of the enzyme IDO1, which generates kynurenine by degrading tryptophan, representing a positive feedback loop that may link inflammation with ROS production. On the other hand, the antioxidant system-inducing transcription factor Nrf2 can be stimulated by Ahr, and Nrf2 can itself activate Ahr expression. The balance between pro- and antioxidant functions of Ahr mediated by kynurenine may therefore regulate healthy versus unhealthy aging in different tissues and organ systems. Potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include exercise to alter kynurenine production or molecules such as metformin or resveratrol that may suppress Ahr activity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These views converge on mitochondria as both the major producer of damaging reactive oxidant species (ROS) and as signaling organelles. A finite proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane leading to a slight uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and respiration is an intrinsic property of all mitochondria and according to the 'uncoupling to survive' hypothesis it has evolved to protect against ROS production to minimize oxidative damage. This hypothesis is supported by evidence linking an increased endogenous, uncoupling protein (UCP1) mediated, as well as experimentally induced mitochondrial uncoupling to an increased lifespan in rodents. This is possibly due to the synergistic activation of molecular pathways linked to life extending effects of caloric restriction as well as a mitohormetic response. Mitohormesis is an adaptive stress response through mitonuclear signaling which increases stress resistance resulting in health promoting effects. Part of this response is the induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), two stress-induced mitokines which elicit beneficial systemic metabolic effects via endocrine action.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Neurogenesis takes place by differentiation of specific Neural Precursor Cells in the neurogenic niche. The main objective of this review is to highlight the specific relationship between the brain cavities, and neurogenesis from neural precursors. Brain cavities and their content, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), establish a key relation with the neurogenic 'niche' because of the presence in this fluid of neurogenic signals able to control neural precursor cell behaviour, inducing precursor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. This influence seems to be ontogenically preserved, despite the temporal and spatial variations that occur throughout life. In order to better understand this concept, we consider three main life periods in the CSF-Neurogenesis interaction: The 'Embryonic' period, which take place at the Neural Tube stage and extends from the isolation of the neural tube at the end of 'neurulation' to the beginning of Choroid Plexus activity; the 'Fetal' period, which includes the remaining developmental and the early postnatal stages; and the 'Adult' period, which continues for the rest of adult life. Each period has specific characteristics in respect of CSF synthesis and composition, and the location, extension and neurogenic activity of the neurogenic niche. However, CSF interaction with the neurogenic niche is a common factor, which should be taken into account to better understand the ontogeny of neuron formation and replacement, as well as its potential role in the success or failure of therapies for the ageing, injured or diseased brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Crown Copyright © 2019.

However, in the case of status epilepticus there are, in addition to these, a variety of specific issues that pose significant hurdles to accurate investigation - not least defining status epilepticus itself and determining whether it is simply a severe manifestation of epilepsy or should be considered a distinct entity in its own right. In this paper, we present a historical overview of how opinions about status epilepticus have changed with time, outline some of the issues unique to the study of status epilepticus and provide personal perspectives on certain controversies within this important area of epileptology. This article focuses on adult status epilepticus as paediatric status epilepticus has been covered in a separate Seizure special edition. With a focus on status epilepticus in adults, we review salient population based studies, exploring their advantages and limitations. While it can be difficult to draw conclusions from these studies, it does seem that status epilepticus is more common in African-Americans, males and in either young children or older adults. Given demographic changes resulting in an ageing population, the incidence of status epilepticus is therefore likely to rise. We illustrate how the majority of work performed to date has been in convulsive status epilepticus and demonstrate that more needs to be done to better understand nonconvulsive status epilepticus as well as to further refine the boundaries of status epilepticus as a whole. Despite status epilepticus being common and associated with significant morbidity, our knowledge of the true epidemiology of this condition remains far from complete.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

A chain of evidence suggest that arginase is implicated in the pathogenesis underlying endothelial dysfunction induced by several cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease including diabetes, hypercholesteremia, ischemia/reperfusion, atherosclerosis, obesity, ageing and hypertension. Recent data has unveiled a key role of arginase as one of the key mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in diabetes and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in previously overlooked compartments including red blood cells. The current review is devoted to discuss arginase as a key mediator in endothelial dysfunction and the potential for therapeutic possibilities to target this enzyme in various diseases, especially type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and ischemia/reperfusion with focus on translational and clinical aspects.

Natural attenuation occurs at pools and plumes, indicating that remediation might be possible. The aims of the study were: i) to assess the role of heterogeneity in the natural attenuation of these compounds, ii) determine degradation processes within this zone, and iii) identify dechlorinating microorganisms. For this, groundwater concentrations, redox-sensitive parameters, CSIA isotopic and DGGE molecular techniques were used. The main findings at depth of the transition zone were: (1) the important key control played by heterogeneity on natural attenuation of contaminants. (2) Heterogeneity caused the highly anoxic environment and dominant sulfate-reducing conditions, which accounts for more efficient natural attenuation. (3) Heterogeneity also explains that the transition zone constitutes an ecotone. (4) The bacteria size exclusion is governed by the pore throat threshold and determines the penetration of dechlorinating microorganisms into the finest sediments, which is relevant, since it implies the need to verify whether microorganisms proposed for bioremediation can penetrate these materials. (5) Reductive dechlorination caused the natural attenuation of contaminants in groundwater and porewater of fine sediments. In the case of carbon tetrachloride, it was an abiotic process biogenically mediated by A. suillum, a bacterium capable of penetrating the finest sediments. In the case of chloroform, it was a biotic process performed by a Clostridiales bacterium, which is unable to penetrate the finest materials. (6) Both microorganisms have potential to be biostimulated to dechlorinate contaminants in the source and the plume in the transition zone. These outcomes are particularly relevant given the longevity of DNAPL sources and have considerable environmental implications as many supply wells in industrial areas exploit aquifers contaminated by chlorinated solvents emerging from DNAPL pools accumulated on the low-conductivity layers in transition zones.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present study addresses these questions by targeted metabolomics in both antemortem blood and postmortem brain samples in 2 community-based longitudinal cohorts of aging and dementia. We found that higher serum levels of 3 acylcarnitines, including decanoylcarnitine (C10), pimelylcarnitine (C7-DC), and tetradecadienylcarnitine (C14:2), significantly predict a lower risk of incident AD (composite hazard ratio = 0.368, 95% CI [0.207, 0.653]) after an average of 4.5-year follow-up, independent of age, sex, and education. In addition, baseline serum levels of ten glycerophospholipids, one amino acid, and 5 acylcarnitines predict the longitudinal change in cognitive functions. Moreover, 28 brain metabolites were associated with AD phenotypes. Of the putative metabolites identified in the serum and brain, 4 metabolites (3 glycerophospholipids [PC aa C30:0, PC ae C34:0, PC ae C36:1] and 1 acylcarnitine [C14:2]) were present in both the postmortem brain and antemortem blood, but only one metabolite (C14:2) was associated with AD in the same direction (i.e., protective). Partial correlation and network analyses suggest a potential tissue-specific regulation of metabolism, although other alternatives exist.

Protein aggregation has been shown as a normal consequence of aging, but it is largely associated with age-related disease, particularly neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington disease (HD). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene and serves as a useful model for neurodegeneration due to its strictly genetic origin. Research in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that glucose protects against cell stress, including proteotoxicity related to aggregation, despite the well-known, lifespan-shortening effects of glucose. We hypothesized that glucose could be beneficial by alleviating energy deficiency, a well-characterized phenomenon in HD. We used C. elegans expressing polyglutamine repeats to quantify lifespan, motility, reproduction, learning, and activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), with and without glucose, to identify the role of glucose in proteotoxicity and neuroprotection. Our data show poly-Q worms on glucose plates exhibited shorter lifespans, no change in motility, learning, or SDH product formation, but had altered reproductive phenotypes.

One of the pathological proteins, alpha-synuclein (α-syn), accumulates in the brains of Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), which are designated as synucleinopathies. Recently, structural properties of abnormal accumulated proteins are suggested to determine the disease phenotype. However, the biochemical and structural characteristics of those accumulated proteins are still poorly understood. We previously reported the sequence and seed-structure-dependent polymorphic fibrils of α-syn and the polymorphism was identified by proteinase K-resistant cores determined by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. In this study, we applied this method to analyze α-syn aggregates of MSA and DLB. To perform MS analysis on proteinase K-resistant cores, we first performed amplification of α-syn aggregates by seeding reaction and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to obtain a sufficient amount of aggregates. Using SDS insoluble fraction of the disease brain, we successfully amplified enough α-syn aggregates for MS analysis. We differentiated between mouse and human α-syn aggregates by MS analysis on proteinase K-resistant cores of the aggregates before and after amplification. The results suggest that structural properties of amplified α-syn fibrils are preserved after PMCA and these methods can be applicable in the study of pathological proteins of the neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

For example, in decisions about treatment, the way patients respond to the advice of family, friends and medical professionals may be used (intentionally or otherwise) as a marker of the 'use or weigh' requirement of decision-making capacity. Here we explore neuroscientific research on decision-making to identify features of advice-taking that help conceptualize this requirement. We focus on studies of the neural and computational basis of decision-making in laboratory settings. These studies originally investigated simple perceptual decisions about ambiguous stimuli, but have more recently been extended to more complex 'value-based' decisions involving the comparison of subjective preferences. Value-based decisions are a useful model system for capacity-related decision-making as they do not have an objectively 'correct' answer and are instead based on subjective preferences. In this context, advice-taking can be seen as a process in which new evidence for one or other option is integrated, leading to altered behaviour or choices. We use this framework to distinguish between different types of advice-taking: private compliance consists of updating one's privately held beliefs based on new evidence, whereas in the case of public compliance, people change their behaviour at a surface level without shifting their privately-held beliefs. Importantly, both types of advice-taking may lead to similar outcomes but rely on different decision processes. We suggest that understanding how multiple mechanisms drive advice-taking holds promise for targeting decision-making support and improving our understanding of the use and weigh requirement in cases of contested capacity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Telomere shortening, a prognostic biomarker of physical health, is related to aging, poor immunocompetence and autonomic nervous system functioning. Cognitive reappraisal is one type of emotion regulation strategy, which involves changing one's appraisal of an aversive situation to modify its emotional impact. Heart rate variability (HRV; i.e., oscillations in heart rate) relates to emotion regulatory processes, such that higher HRV typically reflects greater regulatory capacity. Previous research has identified a positive association between HRV and telomere length. Importantly, the association between HRV and telomere length may change depending on how often an individual uses cognitive reappraisal. One hundred and thirty-seven healthy participants completed measures of cognitive reappraisal frequency, HRV, and underwent blood draws to measure telomere length (computed with the relative ratio of telomere repeat copy number to single copy gene number) in the T cell effector population, CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>-</sup>. Cognitive reappraisal moderated the relationship between telomere length and HRV such that individuals with high cognitive reappraisal frequency had a significant positive association between HRV and telomere length, while individuals with average and less than average frequency did not exhibit this relationship. The results suggest that frequent usage of cognitive reappraisal enhances the already positive influence of HRV on chromosomal integrity in CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>-</sup> T lymphocytes. Although future research is needed to test these effects causally, these findings suggest that regularly using emotion regulation techniques may buffer the relationship between autonomic nervous system functioning and chromosomal integrity in immune cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, cancer registry (CR) data are usually made available with substantial delay to ensure best possible completeness of case ascertainment. Here, we investigate empirically with routinely available data whether such a delay is mandatory for survival analyses or whether data can be used earlier to provide more up-to-date survival estimates. We compared distributions of prognostic factors and period relative survival estimates for three population-based CRs in Germany (Schleswig-Holstein (SH), Rhineland-Palatinate (RP), Saarland (SA)) computed on datasets extracted one (DY+1) to 5 years after the year of diagnosis (DY+5; reference). Analyses were conducted for seven cancer sites and various survival analyses scenarios. The proportion of patients registered in the datasets at a given time varied strongly across registries with 57% (SH), 2% (RP) and 26% (SA) registered in DY+1 and &gt;93% in all registries in DY+3. Five-year survival estimates for the most recent three-year period were comparable to estimates from the reference dataset already in DY+1 (mean absolute deviations = 0.2-0.6% units). Deviations &gt;1% units were only observed for pancreatic and lung cancer in RP and leukemia in SA (all ≤1.5% units). For estimates of 1-year survival based on the most recent 1-year period only, slightly longer delays were required, but reasonable estimates were still obtained after 1-2 years, depending on the CR and cancer site. Thus, progress in cancer survival could be disclosed in a more timely manner than commonly practiced despite delays in completeness of registration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

We found that senescent CD8 cells accumulate with age, while there is a partial reduction of senescent CD4 cells in nonagenarians and centenarians. Moreover, plasma EVs carry T cell specific markers, but no accumulation of 'senescent-like EVs' was found within any of analyzed age groups. Our functional studies of cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and EVs showed that EVs enhance T cell viability and, under phytohemagglutinin stimulation, they influence cytokine secretion and cell activation in an age-dependent manner.

In addition, dogs show an interesting life history trait pattern where smaller individuals are up to two-fold longer lived than their larger counterparts. While some of the mechanisms underlying this size and longevity trade-off are strongly suspected (i.e., growth hormone/IGF-I), there are likely a number of undiscovered mechanisms as well. Accordingly, we have completed a large-scale global metabolomic profiling of dogs encompassing a range of sizes and ages from three cities across the USA. We found a surprisingly strong location signal in the metabolome, stronger in fact than any signal related to age, breed, or sex. However, after controlling for the effects of location, tryptophan metabolism emerged as significantly associated with weight of the dogs, with small dogs having significantly higher levels of tryptophan pathway metabolites. Overall, our results point toward novel, testable hypotheses about the underlying physiological mechanisms that influence size and longevity in the companion dog and suggest that dogs may be useful in sorting out the complexities of the tryptophan metabolic network.</AbstractText>"}

This paper summarizes the main concurrent pain conditions by analyzing the major interactions observed. In particular, co-occurrence will be examined in: visceral pain (especially ischemic heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome, dysmenorrhea/endometriosis and urinary pain), fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain and headache. Two concurrent visceral pains from internal organs sharing at least part of their central sensory projection can give rise to viscero-visceral hyperalgesia, i.e., enhancement of typical pain symptoms from both districts. Visceral pain, headache and musculoskeletal pains (myofascial pain from trigger points, joint pain) can enhance pain and hyperalgesia from fibromyalgia. Myofascial pain from trigger points can perpetuate pain symptoms from visceral pain conditions and trigger migraine attacks when located in the referred pain area from an internal organ or in cervico-facial areas, respectively. The pathophysiology of these pain associations is complex and probably multifactorial; among the possible processes underlying the mutual influence of symptoms recorded in the associations is modulation of central sensitization phenomena by nociceptive inputs from one or the other condition. A strong message in these pain syndrome co-occurrence is that effective treatment of one of the conditions can also improve symptoms from the other, thus suggesting a systematic and thorough evaluation of the pain patient for a global effective management of his/her suffering.</AbstractText>"}

In this work, we provide instructions for archiving digital information in the form of DNA and for subsequently retrieving it from the DNA. In principle, information can be represented in DNA by simply mapping the digital information to DNA and synthesizing it. However, imperfections in synthesis, sequencing, storage and handling of the DNA induce errors within the molecules, making error-free information storage challenging. The procedure discussed here enables error-free storage by protecting the information using error-correcting codes. Specifically, in this protocol, we provide the technical details and precise instructions for translating digital information to DNA sequences, physically handling the biomolecules, storing them and subsequently re-obtaining the information by sequencing the DNA. Along with the protocol, we provide computer code that automatically encodes digital information to DNA sequences and decodes the information back from DNA to a digital file. The required software is provided on a Github repository. The protocol relies on commercial DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing via Illumina dye sequencing, and requires 1-2 h of preparation time, 1/2 d for sequencing preparation and 2-4 h for data analysis. This protocol focuses on storage scales of ~100 kB to 15 MB, offering an ideal starting point for small experiments. It can be augmented to enable higher data volumes and random access to the data and also allows for future sequencing and synthesis technologies, by changing the parameters of the encoder/decoder to account for the corresponding error rates.</AbstractText>"}

Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI can acquire high signal from tendons thus enabling quantitative assessments. Magnetization transfer (MT) modeling combined with UTE-MRI-UTE-MT-modeling-can indirectly assess macromolecular protons in the tendon. This study aimed to determine if UTE-MT-modeling is a quantitative technique sensitive to the age-related changes of tendons. The legs of 26 young healthy (29 ± 6 years old) and 22 elderly (75 ± 8 years old) female subjects were imaged using UTE sequences on a 3T MRI scanner. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all recruited subjects provided written informed consent. T1 and UTE-MT-modeling were performed on anterior tibialis tendons (ATT) and posterior tibialis tendons (PTT) as two representative human leg tendons. A series of MT pulse saturation powers (500-1500°) and frequency offsets (2-50 kHz) were used to measure the macromolecular fraction (MMF) and macromolecular T2 (T2<sub>MM</sub>). All measurements were repeated by three independent readers for a reproducibility study. MMF demonstrated significantly lower values on average in the elderly cohort compared with the younger cohort for both ATT (decreased by 16.8%, p = 0.03) and PTT (decreased by 23.0%, p &lt; 0.01). T2<sub>MM</sub> and T1 did not show a significant nor a consistent difference between the young and elderly cohorts. For all MRI parameters, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was higher than 0.98, indicating excellent consistency between measurements performed by independent readers. MMF serving as a surrogate measure for collagen content, showed a significant decrease in elderly leg tendons. This study highlighted UTE-MRI-MT techniques as a useful quantitative method to assess the impact of aging on human tendons.</AbstractText>"}

AD patients have altered intestinal microbiota. Accordingly, depleting intestinal microbiota in AD animal models reduces amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque deposition. Age-related changes in the microbiota contribute to immunologic and physiologic decline. Translationally relevant dietary manipulations may be an effective approach to slow microbiota changes during aging. We previously showed that calorie restriction (CR) reduced brain Aβ deposition in the well-established Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Presently, we investigated whether CR alters the microbiome during aging. We found that female Tg2576 mice have more substantial age-related microbiome changes compared to wildtype (WT) mice, including an increase in Bacteroides, which were normalized by CR. Specific gut microbiota changes were linked to Aβ levels, with greater effects in females than in males. In the gut, Tg2576 female mice had an enhanced intestinal inflammatory transcriptional profile, which was reversed by CR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Bacteroides colonization exacerbates Aβ deposition, which may be a mechanism whereby the gut impacts AD pathogenesis. These results suggest that long-term CR may alter the gut environment and prevent the expansion of microbes that contribute to age-related cognitive decline.</AbstractText>"}

Recent studies of humans and mice have shown that many age-related diseases, including cancer, are strongly correlated with immunity, and macrophages play particularly important roles in immune regulation. Therefore, NMR macrophages may contribute to their unique phenotypes. However, studies of the roles of macrophages are limited by material restrictions and the lack of an established experimental strategy. In this study, we developed a flow cytometric strategy to identify NMR macrophages. The NMR macrophages were extractable using an off-the-shelf anti-CD11b antibody, M1/70, and forward/side scatter data obtained by flow cytometry. NMR macrophages proliferated in response to human/mouse recombinant M-CSF and engulfed Escherichia coli particles. Interestingly, the majority of NMR macrophages exhibited co-staining with an anti-NK1.1 antibody, PK136. NK1.1 antigen crosslinking with PK136 results in mouse NK cell stimulation; similarly, NMR macrophages proliferated in response to NK1.1 antibody treatment. Furthermore, we successfully established an NMR macrophage cell line, NPM1, by transduction of Simian virus 40 early region that proliferated indefinitely without cytokines and retained its phagocytotic capacity. The NPM1 would contribute to further studies on the immunity of NMRs.</AbstractText>"}

Here we characterise a major germline-soma dissimilarity caused by a germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) in songbirds. We show that the zebra finch GRC contains &gt;115 genes paralogous to single-copy genes on 18 autosomes and the Z chromosome, and is enriched in genes involved in female gonad development. Many genes are likely functional, evidenced by expression in testes and ovaries at the RNA and protein level. Using comparative genomics, we show that genes have been added to the GRC over millions of years of evolution, with embryonic development genes bicc1 and trim71 dating to the ancestor of songbirds and dozens of other genes added very recently. The somatic elimination of this evolutionarily dynamic chromosome in songbirds implies a unique mechanism to minimise genetic conflict between germline and soma, relevant to antagonistic pleiotropy, an evolutionary process underlying ageing and sexual traits.</AbstractText>"}

In addition to 'pure' fibers expressing single MHC isoforms, many fibers are 'hybrids' that co-express two or more different isoforms of MHC or other myofibrillar proteins. Although hybrid fibers have been recognized by muscle biologists for more than three decades, uncertainty persists about their prevalence in normal muscles, their role in fiber-type transitions, and what they might tell us about fiber-type regulation at the cellular and molecular levels. This Review summarizes current knowledge on the relative abundance of hybrid fibers in a variety of muscles from different species. Data from more than 150 muscles from 39 species demonstrate that hybrid fibers are common, frequently representing 25% or more of the fibers in normal muscles. Hybrid fibers appear to have two main roles: (1) they function as intermediates during the fiber-type transitions associated with skeletal muscle development, adaptation to exercise and aging; and (2) they provide a functional continuum of fiber phenotypes, as they possess physiological properties that are intermediate to those of pure fiber types. One aspect of hybrid fibers that is not widely recognized is that fiber-type asymmetries - such as dramatic differences in the MHC composition along the length of single fibers - appear to be a common aspect of many fibers. The final section of this Review examines the possible role of differential activities of nuclei in different myonuclear domains in establishing fiber-type asymmetries.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

Recently, a role for autoimmunity and altered glutamatergic neurotransmission in triggering disease onset has been put forward. We reported the presence of autoantibodies recognizing the GluA3 subunit of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors in about 25% of FTD cases. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms involved in anti-GluA3 autoimmunity, through molecular/neurochemical analyses conducted on patients' brain specimens with frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau neuropathology. We then corroborated these results in vivo in FTD patients with transcranial magnetic stimulation and glutamate, D-serine, and L-serine dosages in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. We observed that GluA3 autoantibodies affect glutamatergic neurotransmission, decreasing glutamate release and altering GluA3-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor levels. These alterations were accompanied by changes of scaffolding proteins involved in receptor synaptic retention/internalization. The above results were confirmed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting a significant impairment of indirect measures of glutamatergic neurotransmission in FTD patients compared with controls, with further add-on harmful effect in those FTD patients with anti-GluA3 antibodies.

However, limited data are available about impacts of co-exposure of PAHs and phthalates on lung function and RTL. We conducted a pilot study with repeated measures during the winter of 2014 and summer of 2015 in Wuhan city, China. Participants took part in the measures of lung function, RTL, urinary monohydroxylated-PAHs (OH-PAHs) and phthalate metabolites over three consecutive days in each season. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used to analyze the relations of OH-PAHs or phthalate metabolites with lung function or RTL. LME models showed the negative associations of 3-day average of hydroxyphenanthrene (2 + 3-, 4-OHPhe) or 1-hydroxypyrene with FEV1, 3-day average of 2 + 3-OHPhe with FVC. BKMR models revealed the negative relation of eight OH-PAHs with FEV1, FVC or RTL; nine phthalate metabolites may counteract an overall effect of eight OH-PAHs on FEV1, FVC or RTL. The findings indicated that urinary phthalate metabolites may counteract the negative association of urinary OH-PAHs on FEV1 or FVC, which may be partially linked to shorter RTL regarding biological aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Paradigm shifting insight has accrued from such concerted investment, leading to novel mechanistic understanding of PCOS, including hyperandrogenic fetal and peripubertal origins, epigenetic programming, altered neural function, defective oocytes and embryos, adipogenic constraint enhancing progression to insulin resistance, pancreatic decompensation and type 2 diabetes, together with placental compromise, all contributing to transgenerational transmission of traits likely to manifest in adult PCOS phenotypes.

The protein is generally expressed at low/intermediate levels on hematological tissues and some solid tumors, scoring the highest levels on plasma cells (PC) and PC-derived neoplasia. CD38 was originally described as a receptor expressed by activated cells, mainly T lymphocytes, wherein it also regulates cell adhesion and cooperates in signal transduction mediated by major receptor complexes. Furthermore, CD38 metabolizes extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>, generating ADPR and cyclic ADPR. This ecto-enzyme controls extra-cellular nucleotide homeostasis and intra-cellular calcium fluxes, stressing its relevance in multiple physiopathological conditions (infection, tumorigenesis and aging). In clinics, CD38 was adopted as a cell activation marker and in the diagnostic/staging of leukemias. Quantitative surface CD38 expression by multiple myeloma (MM) cells was the basic criterion used for therapeutic application of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Anti-CD38 mAbs-mediated PC depletion in autoimmunity and organ transplants is currently under investigation. This review analyzes different aspects of CD38's role in regulatory cell populations and how these effects are obtained. Characterizing CD38 functional properties may widen the extension of therapeutic applications for anti-CD38 mAbs. The availability of therapeutic mAbs with different effects on CD38 enzymatic functions may be rapidly translated to immunotherapeutic strategies of cell immune defense.</AbstractText>"}

Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were assayed for total iron content, expression of 8-oxoguanine and DNA glycosylase (OGG1), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and damage. Circulating ferritin and hepcidin levels were also quantified. Muscle iron levels were greater in the old group. Protein expression of transferrin receptor 1, Zrt-Irt-like protein (ZIP) 8, and ZIP14 were lower in old participants. Circulating levels of ferritin, hepcidin, interleukin 6 (IL6), and C-reactive protein were higher in the old group. Old participants showed lower mtDNA content and greater mtDNA damage. OGG1 protein expression declined with age, whereas 3-NT levels were greater in old participants. Finally, a negative correlation was determined between ZIP14 expression and circulating IL6 levels in LF older adults. None of assayed parameters differed between HF and LF participants. Our findings suggest that muscle iron homeostasis is altered in old age, which might contribute to loss of mtDNA stability.

A significantly higher risk of developing sarcopenia/severe sarcopenia during the four-year follow-up based on the GLIM [sarcopenia: Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 3.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73-6.05); severe sarcopenia: Adjusted HR = 2.87 (95% CI 1.25-6.56)] and ESPEN [sarcopenia: Adjusted HR = 4.28 (95% CI 1.86-9.86); severe sarcopenia: Adjusted HR = 3.86 (95% CI 1.29-11.54)] criteria was observed. Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed this relationship (log rank <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for all). These results highlighted the importance of malnutrition since it has been shown to be associated with an approximately fourfold higher risk of developing sarcopenia/severe sarcopenia during a four-year follow-up.</AbstractText>"}

An adapted version of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was conducted, and three superordinate themes were identified. Firstly, 'negotiating the space between health and illness' identified how participants rejected the illness identity and struggled with a treatment regime, which reminded them of the longevity of their condition. Secondly, 'tensions in adopting a biomedical perspective' considered how medical professionals overlooked the negative side effects medication had on participants' lives, in favor of optimal seizure control.

At the global brain level, the human MTL has been described as part of the default mode network and amygdala nuclei as parts of the salience network, with both networks collectively forming a large-scale brain system supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. We hypothesized (i) that intrinsic functional connectivity of slow activity fluctuations would reveal human MTL subsystems locally extending to the amygdala; and (ii) that these extended local subsystems would be globally embedded in large-scale brain systems supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. Capitalizing on resting-state fMRI data of three independent samples of cognitively healthy adults (one main and two replication samples: N ​= ​101, 60, and 29, respectively), we analyzed the functional connectivity of fluctuating ongoing BOLD-activity within and outside the amygdala-MTL in a data-driven way using masked independent component and dual-regression analyses. We found that at the local level, MTL subsystems extend to the amygdala and are functionally organized along the longitudinal amygdala-MTL axis. These subsystems are characterized by consistent involvement of amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex, but variable participation of perirhinal and parahippocampal regions. At the global level, amygdala-MTL subsystems selectively connect to salience, thalamic-brainstem, and default mode networks - the major cortical and subcortical components of the allostatic-interoceptive system. These findings provide evidence for integrated amygdala-MTL subsystems in humans, which are embedded within a larger allostatic-interoceptive system.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The current expectation is their use as specific biomarkers and therapeutic tools due to their inner characteristics. However, several investigations still need to be done before we can use them in the clinic. First, their categorization is still under debate, although an accurate classification of EVs subtypes should be based on physical characteristics, biochemical composition or condition description of the cell of origin. Second, EVs carry lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that can induce epigenetic modifications on target cells. These cargos, as well as EVs biogenesis, shedding and uptake is both ageing and redox sensitive. More specifically, senescence and oxidative stress increase EVs release, and their altered content can trigger antioxidant but also prooxidant responses in target cells thereby modulating the redox status. Further analysis would help to asses EVs role in the development and progression of oxidative stress-related pathologies. In this review we aimed to summarize the current knowledge on EVs and their involvement in redox modulation on age-related pathologies.

These disorders have already become a major burden on society and threaten to become a defining challenge of our generation. Indications such as Alzheimer's disease gain headlines and have focused the thinking of many towards dementia and cognitive decline in aging. Indications related to neurological function and related behaviors are thus an extremely important starting point in the consideration of therapeutics.However, the reality is that pathological aging covers a spectrum of significant neurological and peripheral indications. Development of therapeutics to treat aging and age-related disorders is therefore a huge need, but represents a largely unexplored path. Fundamental scientific questions need to be considered as we embark towards a goal of improving health in old age, including how we 1) define aging as a therapeutic target, 2) model aging preclinically and 3) effectively translate from preclinical models to man. Furthermore, the challenges associated with identifying novel therapeutics in a financial, regulatory and clinical sense need to be contemplated carefully to ensure we address the unmet need in our increasingly elderly population. The complexity of the challenge requires different perspectives, cross-functional partnerships and diverse concepts. We seek to raise issues to guide the field, considering the current state of thinking to aid in identifying roadblocks and important challenges early.

The Catabody Platform emerged from discovery of beneficial germline gene catabodies that hydrolyzed self-proteins by transient covalent pairing of the strong catabody nucleophile with a weak target protein electrophile. Catabodies have evolved by Darwinian natural selection for protection against misfolded self-proteins that threatened survival by causing amyloid disease. Ancient antibody scaffolds upregulate the catalytic activity of the antibody variable (V) domains. Healthy humans universally produce beneficial catabodies specific for at least 3 misfolded self-proteins, transthyretin, amyloid β peptide and tau protein. Catabody are superior to ordinary antibodies because of catalyst reuse for thousands of target destruction cycles with little or no risk of causing inflammation, a must for non-toxic removal of abundant targets such as amyloids. Library mining with electrophilic target analogs (ETAs) isolates therapy-grade catabodies (fast, specific). Ex vivo- and in vivo-verified catabodies specific for the misfolded protein are available to dissolve brain, cardiac and vertebral amyloids. Immunization with ETAs overcomes important ordinary vaccine limitations (no catabody induction, poor immunogenicity of key target epitopes).

We investigated the role of the volumetric composition of the intracranial space (VOCICS) in terms of relative brain volume (BV%) and relative cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV%) on the neural activity measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We performed a group rs-fMRI analysis of a dataset of 192 healthy subjects derived by the publicly available Functional Connectome Project. Automatic volumetric analysis of structural data was performed in order to obtain BV% and CSFV% for every subject. Two fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) and two region of interest-to-region of interest (ROI-to-ROI) analyses were then performed using BV% and CSFV% as second-level covariates, adopting a multiple regression statistic test in order to evaluate the effects of BV% and CSFV% on brain networks. The analyses revealed that VOCICS broadly influences brain networks. In conclusion, VOCICS significantly influences brain activity measured by rs-fMRI, and this parameter could represent an easy marker of brain connectivity in healthy young subjects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Numbers of people with dementia also continue to rise, and much of their care will be provided by relatives. As such, more people who may themselves be older, will take on such caring roles. Consequently, more carers are likely to have education and support needs. Amidst government recognition of the need to provide good quality, person-centred education and support to carers, there are tensions between the potential for such provision to be resource intensive and whether existing services have the capacity to meet the needs of carers. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a resource with scope to meet some of these educational and support needs. MOOCs enable flexible learning, are often free, and can be accessed anywhere in the world. Providing supportive dementia care requires carers to have an understanding of the condition, assistance to cope with the responsibilities of caring, and recognition of the importance of their own health and wellbeing as well as the person they support. In response to the needs of family carers of people with advancing dementia identified through a 5 year programme of research, we developed a MOOC-dementia care: living well as dementia progresses. This is an accessible source of relevant and engaging information; which enables carers to learn about advancing dementia, consider their own needs and create an interactive global forum of peer support.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, due to the lack of clinical samples and appropriate tools for studying DNA repair, whether and how age-associated changes in DNA repair result in a loss of genome integrity of human adult stem cells remains incompletely characterized. Here, we isolated 20 eyelid adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) lines from healthy individuals (young: 10 donors with ages ranging 17-25 years; old: 10 donors with ages ranging 50-59 years). Using these cell lines, we systematically compared the efficiency of base excision repair (BER) and two DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways-nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)-between the young and old groups. Surprisingly, we found that the efficiency of BER but not NHEJ or HR is impaired in aged human ADSCs, which is in contrast to previous findings that DSB repair declines with age in human fibroblasts. We also demonstrated that BER efficiency is negatively associated with tail moment, which reflects a loss of genome integrity in human ADSCs. Mechanistic studies indicated that at the protein level XRCC1, but not other BER factors, exhibited age-associated decline. Overexpression of XRCC1 reversed the decline of BER efficiency and genome integrity, indicating that XRCC1 is a potential therapeutic target for stabilizing genomes in aged ADSCs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Recent evidence suggests that individuals could benefit from diets adapted to their genotype and phenotype: that is, personalized nutrition. A novel strategy is to tailor diets for groups of individuals according to their metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes). Randomized controlled trials evaluating metabotype-specific responses and nonresponses are urgently needed to bridge the current gap of knowledge with regard to the efficacy of personalized strategies in nutrition. In this Perspective, we discuss the concept of metabotyping, review the current literature on metabotyping in the context of cardiometabolic disease prevention, and suggest potential strategies for metabotype-based nutritional advice for future work. We also discuss potential determinants of metabotypes, including gut microbiota, and highlight the use of metabolomics to define effective markers for cardiometabolic disease-related metabotypes. Moreover, we hypothesize that people at high risk for cardiometabolic diseases have distinct metabotypes and that individuals grouped into specific metabotypes may respond differently to the same diet, which is being tested in a project of the Joint Programming Initiative: A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

On the basis of pathophysiology of cell senescence and of chronic degenerative diseases, possible preventive/therapeutic pathways have been examined. Chronic low grade cellular inflammation and chronic stress have been shown as the general interlinked factors inducing aging, on the basis of complex biochemical, cell and multi-organ derangements. The main cell degenerative processes which have been related to aging are: altered mitochondria DNA/metabolism, excessive oxidative stress, glycation, alteration of autophagy and proteasome, genome alterations. Literature about longevity-targeting interventions, beyond conventional medicine, describes a spectrum of possible measures to improve psycho-biological resilience, based on PNEI paradigm, on hormesis and upon mitochondria-targeted interventions.

A few reports from the mid-1940s have demonstrated a high prevalence of latent and active tuberculosis infections. The high disease burden urged the newly established government to place a high priority on tuberculosis control. The government led a nationwide effort to control tuberculosis by building dedicated hospitals, conducting mass screening, providing technical and material support for microbiological diagnosis, administering Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination, and improving appropriate antibiotic treatment through public health centers. Such concerted efforts resulted in a gradual decrease in the disease burden of tuberculosis, as demonstrated by National Tuberculosis Prevalence Surveys and notifiable disease statistics.

{"PMID":31782048,"Title":"Ageing and the Case of Democratic Medicine in Japan.","Journal":"Journal of cross-cultural gerontology","Date":"Nov 28 2019","Keywords":"Ageing, Cooperatives, Coproduction, Japan, Medical institutions, Social capital","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Aging populations present serious challenges to societies for the provision of care and support for their eldest members. These include increased demands on families for care at home, shortages of professional care workers and facilities, and financial strains on governmental budgets. However, these conditions also provide space for the elderly to adapt institutions to secure care and support. This essay examines the ways the elderly work through Min-Iren, a federation of medical institutions in Japan, to meet their needs. Premised on a 'democratic' model of solidarity, Min-Iren institutional structure provides participating elderly substantial power to modify ostensibly medical institutions. Drawing from 18 months of fieldwork, this essay ethnographically explores how the elderly refashion Min-Iren clinics and hospitals to offer venues for socializing, community building, and political action as well as conventional medical care. On the medical side, Min-Iren institutions enact a form of coproduction of health. However, interpreted from the perspective of social capital, Min-Iren institutions' forays into local social milieus resemble activities of civic organizations and foster social engagement, collective action, and social support. In the hands of the elderly, Min-Iren medical institutions, thus, endeavor to improve individual and neighborhood wellbeing in ways beyond medical care. Min-Iren's model that centers participation and local ownership is general and can be applied to other contexts.</AbstractText>"}

The results indicated that 0.5- and 1.0-g/kg VC treatments activated mTOR signaling by inhibiting GSK-3β expression. The mRNA expression of FAS, ACC, and ACL, as well as the content of TG, TC, and NEFA, was decreased by 0.5- and 1.0-g/kg VC treatments. Moreover, to confirm GSK-3β playing a key role in regulating TSC2 and mTOR, GSK-3β RNA was interfered and the activity of GSK-3β was inhibited by 25- and 50-mg/L LiCl treatments, respectively. The results indicated that GSK-3β inactivation played a significant role in inducing mTOR signaling and inhibiting lipid deposition. VC treatments could induce mTOR signaling by inhibiting GSK-3β, and mTOR further participated in regulating lipid deposition by controlling lipid profile in the liver of zebrafish.</AbstractText>"}

We selected a case-control sample nested within the Nurses' Health Study (starting year 1976, mean age=51 years-old), including 14,956 women aged ≥70 years and free of both stroke and cognitive impairment at enrollment in a cognitive sub-study (1995-2001). Cases (n=1,496) were women with the 10% worst slopes of cognitive decline and controls (n=7,478) those with slopes better than the median. We compared the trajectories of body mass index, the alternate Mediterranean diet (A-MeDi) score, and physical activity between groups, from midlife through 1 year preceding the cognitive sub-study. In midlife, cases had higher body mass index (mean difference [MD] versus controls=0.59 [95% confidence interval [CI]:0.39,0.80] kg/m2), lower physical activity (MD=-1.41 [95%CI:-2.07,-0.71] metabolic-equivalent hours/week) and worse A-MeDi scores (MD=-0.16 [95%CI:-0.26,-0.06] point). From mid- through later-life, compared to controls, cases had consistently lower A-MeDi scores, but a deceleration of weight gain and a faster decrease of physical activity. In conclusion, maintaining healthy lifestyle since midlife may help reduce cognitive decline in aging. At older ages, both deceleration of weight gain and decrease in physical activity may reflect early signs of cognitive impairment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Merrill (Fabaceae), wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae), and canola, Brassica napus L. var. oleifera (Brassicaceae). Considering the survivorship for D. furcatus nymphs, it was greater on soybean and wheat, for E. heros nymphs it was greater on soybean compared to canola and wheat, and for N. viridula nymphs the survivorship was greater on soybean and canola. Dichelops furcatus nymphs developed faster on soybean and wheat, and E. heros and N. viridula nymphs developed faster on soybean and canola. Body weight at adult emergency for D. furcatus was greater on soybean and wheat, and for E. heros and N. viridula, it was greater on soybean. Adult survivorship and longevity were similar on soybean/wheat/canola for D. furcatus and N. viridula, and greater on soybean for E. heros. Reproduction and weight gain of adults were greater on soybean and wheat for D. furcatus, and on soybean for E. heros; N. viridula reproduced only on soybean and tended to gain greater body weight in this food source. As expected, soybean considering its superior nutritional quality was, in general, the best food.

To identify the underlying molecular changes during ovarian aging, pigs were used as model animals. Genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome-wide RNA expression analyses were performed via high-throughput sequencing of ovaries from young pigs (180 days, puberty stage of first ovulation) and old pigs (eight years, reproductive exhaustion stage). The results identified 422 different methylation regions between old and young pigs; furthermore, a total of 2,243 mRNAs, 95 microRNAs, 248 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 116 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were differentially expressed during both developmental stages. Gene ontology analysis showed that these genes related to different methylation and expression are involved in the ovarian aging cycle. Specifically, these are involved in cell apoptosis, death effector domain binding, embryonic development, reproduction and fertilization process, ovarian cumulus expansion, and the ovulation cycle. Multigroup cooperative control relationships were also assessed, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed in the ovarian aging cycle. These data will help to clarify ovary age-associated potential molecular changes in DNA methylation and transcriptional patterns over time.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Xiaoyu Xi et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It improves quality of life, life expectancy, and has a lower financial burden to the healthcare system in comparison to dialysis. Every year more and more older patients are included in the kidney transplant waitlist. Within this patient population, transplanted subjects have better survival and quality of life as compared to those on dialysis. It is therefore crucial to select older patients who may benefit from renal transplantation, as well as those particularly at risk for post-transplant complications. Sarcopenia and frailty are frequently neglected in the evaluation of kidney transplant candidates. Both conditions are interrelated complex geriatric syndromes that are linked to disability, aging, comorbidities, increased mortality, and graft failure post-transplantation. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and more importantly ESRD are characterized by multiple metabolic complications that contribute for the development of sarcopenia and frailty. In particular, anorexia, metabolic acidosis and chronic low-grade inflammation are the main contributors to the development of sarcopenia, a key component in frail transplant candidates and recipients. Both frailty and sarcopenia are considered to be reversible. Frail patients respond well to multiprofessional interventions that focus on the patients' positive frailty criteria, while physical rehabilitation and oral supplementation may improve sarcopenia. Prospective studies are still needed to evaluate the utility of formally measuring frailty and sarcopenia in the older candidates to renal transplantation as part of the transplant evaluation process.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gandolfini, Regolisti, Bazzocchi, Maggiore, Palmisano, Piotti, Fiaccadori and Sabatino.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In recent years, it, however, has become clear that there are intimate links between mitochondria, telomeres, and telomerase subunits. Mitochondrial dysfunctions cause telomere attrition, while telomere damage leads to reprogramming of mitochondrial biosynthesis and mitochondrial dysfunctions, which has important implications in aging and diseases. In addition, evidence has accumulated that telomere-independent functions of telomerase also exist and that the protein component of telomerase TERT shuttles between the nucleus and mitochondria under oxidative stress. Our previously published data show that the RNA component of telomerase <i>TERC</i> is also imported into mitochondria, processed, and exported back to the cytosol. These data show a complex regulation network where telomeres, nuclear genome, and mitochondria are co-regulated by multi-localization and multi-function proteins and RNAs. This review summarizes the connections between mitochondria and telomeres, the mitochondrion-related functions of telomerase subunits, and how they play a role in crosstalk between mitochondria and the nucleus.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zheng, Huang and Wang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

A hypothesized path model and two alternative models suggested the retention of a model whereby naïve realism led to RWA, which led to SDO, and finally to ageism. All possible direct and indirect effects were significant within the retained model, suggesting the presence of a multiple mediation. The fit of this model was superior to that of models testing alternative theoretical causal chains. Naïve realism may lead to authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, which may then increase the value that people place on social hierarchies, and this may influence the development and retention of ageist beliefs.

Ample evidence has established a pivotal role for interrupted mitochondrial homeostasis in the onset and development of aging-related cardiovascular anomalies. A number of culprit factors have been suggested in aging-associated mitochondrial anomalies including oxidative stress, lipid toxicity, telomere shortening, metabolic disturbance, and DNA damage, with recent findings revealing a likely role for compromised mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial quality control machinery such as autophagy. Mitochondria undergo consistent fusion and fission, which are crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis and energy adaptation. Autophagy, in particular, mitochondria-selective autophagy, namely, mitophagy, refers to a highly conservative cellular process to degrade and clear long-lived or damaged cellular organelles including mitochondria, the function of which gradually deteriorates with increased age. Mitochondrial homeostasis could be achieved through a cascade of independent but closely related processes including fusion, fission, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. With improved health care and increased human longevity, the ever-rising aging society has imposed a high cardiovascular disease prevalence. It is thus imperative to understand the role of mitochondrial homeostasis in the regulation of lifespan and healthspan. Targeting mitochondrial homeostasis should offer promising novel therapeutic strategies against aging-related complications, particularly cardiovascular diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ne N.

RNA-sequencing was conducted to profile lncRNA expression in the cochlea of an early-onset AHL mouse model. RT-qPCR assay was used to validate the expression pattern of lncRNAs. ATP assay, JC-1 assay, mitochondrial probe staining, CCK-8 assay, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry were performed to detect the effects of lncRNA AW112010 in HEI-OC1 cells and the mouse cochlea. We identified 88 significantly upregulated lncRNAs and 46 significantly downregulated lncRNAs in the cochlea of aged C57BL/6 mice. We focused on the significantly upregulated AW112010. Silencing of AW112010 decreased the ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell viability and increased mitochondrial ROS generation under oxidative stress in HEI-OC1 cells. AW112010 overexpression promoted cell survival in HEI-OC1 cells. AW112010 knockdown reduced mitochondrial mass and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis in HEI-OC1 cells. Activation of mitochondrial biogenesis by resveratrol and STR1720 promoted cell survival. The mitochondrial biogenesis process was activated in the cochlea of aged mice. Moreover, AW112010 regulated AMPK signaling in HEI-OC1 cells. Transcription factor Arid5b elevated in the aged cochlea and induced AW112010 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in HEI-OC1 cells.

Although autophagy is essentially protective, depending on the cellular context and stimuli, autophagy outcome can lead to either abnormal cell growth or cell death. The autophagic process requires a tight regulation, with cellular events following distinct stages and governed by a wide molecular machinery. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been involved in autophagy regulation through multiple signaling pathways, and mitochondria, the main source of endogenous ROS, have emerged as essential signal transducers that mediate autophagy.

Body fat mass was lower and the lean mass was higher in SFe-fed mice. In addition, the grip strength was enhanced in SFe-fed mice. Histological analysis of the tibialis anterior muscle showed that the size of myofiber and slow-twitch red muscle was increased by SFe supplementation. The expression of proteins related to muscle protein synthesis such as phospho-Erk1 and phospho-S6K1 was increased by SFe supplementation. The mRNA expression of genes related to myogenesis and their encoded proteins such as MyoD, Myf5, MRF4, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain, was increased, whereas that of genes related to muscle degradation, such as atrogin-1, MuRF-1, and myostatin, were decreased relative to control mice.

Here, we examined whether SCPE could improve cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice by reducing hippocampal inflammation and pyroptosis. Seven-month-old senescence-accelerated P8 mice (SAMP8) received SCPE (2.3 g/kg/day; 4.6 g/kg/day; 9.2 g/kg/day) for 28 days. Cognitive function and morphometric examinations were performed followed by water maze testing, hematoxylin-eosin staining, Congo red staining, toluidine blue staining, and TUNEL analysis of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. Escape latency increased and times across platforms decreased in SAMP8 mice; however, both of them were normalized by SCPE after 28 days. Aging caused significant pyroptosis in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, as evidenced by neuronal degeneration and necrosis, amyloid deposition, and decreased Nissl body amounts after cognitive impairment, which were greatly improved by SCPE. SCPE reduced serum IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-<i>α</i> levels and reduced hippocampal NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, GSDM-D, IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-6, IL-18, and A<i>β</i> expression.

It is related to aging, noise, infection, ototoxic drugs, and genetic defects. It is essential to identify reversible and preventable causes to be able to reduce the burden of this disease. Inflammation is involved in most causes and leads to tissue injury through vasospasm-associated ischemia. Vasospasm is reversible. This review summarized evidence linking inflammation-induced vasospasm to several forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. The link between vasospasm and sensorineural hearing loss is directly evident in subarachnoid haemorrhage, which involves the release of vasoconstriction-inducing cytokines like interleukin-1, endothelin-1, and tumour necrosis factor. These proinflammatory cytokines can also be released in response to infection, autoimmune disease, and acute or chronically increased inflammation in the ageing organism as in presbyacusis or in noise-induced cochlear injury. Evidence of vasospasm and hearing loss has also been discovered in bacterial meningitis and brain injury. Resolution of inflammation-induced vasospasm has been associated with improvement of hearing in autoimmune diseases involving overproduction of interleukin-1 from inflammasomes. There is mainly indirect evidence for vasospasm-associated sensorineural hearing loss in most forms of systemic or injury- or infection-induced local vascular inflammation. This opens up avenues in prevention and treatment of vascular and systemic inflammation as well as vasospasm itself as a way to prevent and treat most forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Future research needs to investigate interventions antagonising vasospasm and vasospasm-inducing proinflammatory cytokines and their production in randomised controlled trials of prevention and treatment of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Prime candidates for interventions are hereby inflammasome inhibitors and vasospasm-reducing drugs like nitric oxide donors, rho-kinase inhibitors, and magnesium which have the potential to reduce sensorineural hearing loss in meningitis, exposure to noise, brain injury, arteriosclerosis, and advanced age-related and autoimmune disease-related inflammation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Michael Eisenhut.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Twenty patients with stroke and 20 healthy controls were recruited for the collection of data on the beta oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex (M1). All participants performed the conditions of resting, observation only, and video observation combined with execution (video AOE). Stroke patients performed one additional condition of affected hand observation combined with execution (affected hand AOE). The relative change index of beta oscillations was calculated, and nonparametric tests were used to examine the differences in conditions. In stroke patients, the relative change index of M1 beta oscillatory activity under the video AOE condition was significantly lower than that under the observation only and affected hand AOE conditions. Moreover, M1 cortical activity did not significantly differ under the observation only and affected hand AOE conditions. For healthy controls, the relative change index under the video AOE condition was significantly lower than that under the observation only condition. In addition, no significant differences in relative change indices were found under the observation only and video AOE conditions between the 2 groups.

We found a significant depletion of CD4 T cells, which was inversely correlated with the cell apoptosis in virus-suppressed HIV subjects compared to age-matched healthy subjects (HS). In addition, HIV CD4 T cells were prone to DNA damage that extended to chromosome ends-telomeres, leading to accelerated telomere erosion-a hallmark of cell senescence. Mechanistically, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) sensors MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (MRN complex) remained intact, but both expression and activity of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and its downstream checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) were significantly suppressed in HIV CD4 T cells.

Prolonged priming with ultra-low LPS doses provokes trained immunity, i.e., increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators in comparison to the unprimed control. In contrast, priming with high doses of LPS induces immune tolerance, implying decreased production of inflammatory mediators and pronounced release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Investigation of the signaling processes and cell functions involved in these memory-like immune responses reveals the essential role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ), one of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase species highly expressed in innate immune cells.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for osteoarthritis, whereas hypertension is often treated with L-type voltage-operated calcium channel blocking drugs, nifedipine being among the most classical ones. Although nifedipine together with other L-type voltage-operated calcium channel inhibitors plays an important role in controlling hypertension, there are unresolved questions concerning its possible effect on cartilage tissue homeostasis and the development of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of nifedipine on metabolic processes in human chondrocytes and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. To better understand whether the metabolic effects are mediated specifically through L-type voltage-operated calcium channel, effects of the agonist BayK8644 were analyzed in parallel. Nifedipine downregulated and mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in both cell types. Analysis of cartilage explants by electron microscopy also suggested that a small number of chondrocyte mitochondria's lose their activity in response to nifedipine. Conversely, nifedipine enhanced glycolytic capacity in chondrocytes, suggesting that these cells have the capacity to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and alter their metabolic activity in response to L-type voltage-operated calcium channel inhibition. Such a metabolic switch was not observed in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Nitric oxide activity was upregulated by nifedipine in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and particularly in chondrocytes, implying its involvement in the effects of nifedipine on metabolism in both tested cell types. Furthermore, stimulation with nifedipine resulted in elevated production of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans in micromass cultures under chondrogenic conditions. Taken together, we conclude that the antihypertensive drug nifedipine inhibits mitochondrial respiration in both chondrocytes and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and that these effects may be associated with the increased nitric oxide accumulation and pro-inflammatory activity. Nifedipine had positive effects on the production of collagen type II and proteoglycans in both cell types, implying potentially beneficial anabolic responses in articular cartilage.

Strategies for interpersonal emotion regulation like disclosing to the partner are supposed to play a major role in the psychosocial adjustment to multimorbidity. Research has often focused on disease-related disclosure, even though disclosing thoughts and feelings related to mundane, everyday life occurrences might also play a role in coadjustment. The current dyadic study aimed at investigating the association between these two types of interpersonal regulation strategies and adjustment disorder symptoms, following the new ICD 11 criteria in multimorbid patients and their partners.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Methods' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>Shortly after being hospitalized due to an acute health crisis, <i>N</i> = 28 multimorbid patients (average age 70 years) and their partners filled in questionnaires on disclosure in the couple, adjustment disorder criteria of the ICD 11 ('preoccupation,' 'failure to adapt'), and sleep problems.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Results' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>Both patients and their partners did show similarly high levels of preoccupation and failure to adapt indicating adjustment problems to the complex health situation. The adjustment symptoms of both partners correlated between <i>r</i> = 0.22 and 0.45. Regression based on Actor-Partner Interdependence-Models revealed that own mundane disclosure was related to less adjustment symptoms in the patients. Beyond that, a partner effect was observed, revealing a negative association between partners' illness-related disclosure and the patients' level of preoccupation. For the partners, mundane disclosure of the partner was associated with less preoccupation, failure to adapt, and reported sleep problems above and beyond own disclosure reports. Furthermore, there was an actor effect of disease-related disclosure on less sleep problems for the partners.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Conclusion' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>These results support an interpersonal view on adjustment processes to physical disease. Disclosure as a way of regulating the relationship and emotional responses might play a relevant role here, which seems to be different for patients and their partners.

Yet, the impact of hearing loss on the aging brain, particularly on large-scale brain networks that support cognition and language, is relatively unknown. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify hearing loss-related changes in the functional connectivity of primary auditory cortex to determine if these changes are distinct from age and cognitive measures known to decline with age (e.g., working memory and processing speed). We assessed the functional connectivity of Heschl's gyrus in 31 older adults (60-80 years) who expressed a range of hearing abilities from normal hearing to a moderate hearing loss. Our results revealed that both left and right Heschl's gyri were significantly connected to regions within auditory, sensorimotor, and visual cortices, as well as to regions within the cingulo-opercular network known to support attention. Participant age, working memory, and processing speed did not significantly correlate with any connectivity measures once variance due to hearing loss was removed. However, hearing loss was associated with increased connectivity between right Heschl's gyrus and the dorsal anterior cingulate in the cingulo-opercular network even once variance due to age, working memory, and processing speed was removed. This greater connectivity was not driven by high frequency hearing loss, but rather by hearing loss measured in the 0.5-2 kHz range, particularly in the left ear. We conclude that hearing loss-related differences in functional connectivity in older adults are distinct from other aging-related differences and provide insight into a possible neural mechanism of compensation for hearing loss in older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Fitzhugh, Hemesath, Schaefer, Baxter and Rogalsky.</CopyrightInformation>"}

At present, the impact of, and interaction between, disease progression and other age-related physiological changes in CF on exercise capacity from child- to adult-hood is poorly understood. Indeed, the influences of disease progression and aging are inherently linked, leading to increasingly complex interactions. Thus, when interpreting age-related differences in exercise tolerance and devising exercise-based therapies for those with CF, it is critical to consider age-specific factors. Specifically, changes in lung function, chronic airway colonization by increasingly pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria, the frequency and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, endocrine comorbidities, nutrition-related factors, and CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein) modulator therapy, duration, and age of onset are important to consider. Accounting for how these factors ultimately influence the ability to exercise is central to understanding exercise impairments in individuals with CF, especially as the expected lifespan with CF continues to increase with advancements in therapies. Further studies are required that account for these factors and the changing landscape of CF in order to better understand <i>how</i> the evolution of CF disease impacts exercise (in)tolerance across the lifespan and thereby identify appropriate intervention targets and strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Shei, Mackintosh, Peabody Lever, McNarry and Krick.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The most common neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Neurons have high energy demands, and dysregulation of mitochondrial quality and function is an important cause of neuronal degeneration. Mitochondrial quality control plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and ensuring normal mitochondrial function; thus, defects in mitochondrial quality control are also significant causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 has been found to have a large effect on mitochondrial function. Recent studies have also shown that SIRT3 has a role in mitochondrial quality control, including in the refolding or degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, all of which are affected in neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Meng, Yan, Lei, Wan, Hou, Sun and Zhou.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Tau is a neuronal protein involved in the stabilization of microtubule structures of the axon and the aberrant phosphorylation of tau is associated with several neurotoxic effects. The discovery of tau pathology and aggregates in the cortex of Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients has focused interest on hyperphosphorylation of tau as a potential mechanism contributing to increased states of hyperexcitability and cognitive decline. Previous studies using animal models of status epilepticus and tissue from patients with TLE have shown increased tau phosphorylation in the brain following acute seizures and during epilepsy, with tau phosphorylation correlating with cognitive deficits in patients. Suggesting a functional role of tau during epilepsy, studies in tau-deficient and tau-overexpressing mice have demonstrated a causal role of tau during seizure generation. Previous studies, analyzing the impact of seizures on tau hyperphosphorylation, have mainly used animal models of acute seizures. These models, however, do not replicate all aspects of chronic epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute seizures (status epilepticus) and chronic epilepsy upon the expression and phosphorylation of tau using the intra-amygdala kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus mouse model. Status epilepticus resulted in an immediate increase in total tau levels in the hippocampus, in particular, the dentate gyrus, and phosphorylation of the AT8 epitope (Ser202, Thr205), with phosphorylated tau mainly localizing to the mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus. During epilepsy, abnormal phosphorylation of tau was detected again at the AT8 epitope with lower total tau levels in the CA3 and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus. Chronic epilepsy in mice also resulted in a strong localization of AT8 phospho-tau to microglia, indicating a distinct pattern of tau hyperphosphorylation during chronic epilepsy compared to status epilepticus. Our results reaffirm previous observations of tau phosphorylation post-status epilepticus, but also elaborate on tau alterations in epileptic mice which more faithfully mimic TLE. Our results confirm seizures affect tau hyperphosphorylation, however, suggest epitope-specific phosphorylation of tau and differences in cell-specific localization according to disease progression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Alves, Kenny, de Leo, Beamer and Engel.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Fifty-five participants (26 young students; 20 cognitive healthy older adults; nine patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) were shown multiple slides (experimental trials), each containing an array of nine common objects for recall. Most of the arrays contained three objects from three semantic categories, each. In the remaining arrays, the nine objects were unrelated. Eye fixations were also monitored during the viewing of the arrays, in a subset of the participants. While for young participants the immediate recall was higher for the semantically related arrays, this effect was diminished in healthy elderly and totally absent in MCI patients. Furthermore, only in the young group did the sequence of eye fixations show a semantic scanning pattern during encoding, even when the related objects were non- adjacent in the array. Healthy elderly and MCI patients were not influenced by the semantic relatedness of items during the array encoding, to the same extent as young subjects, as observed by a lack of (or reduced) semantic scanning.

The magnitude of the hyperemic response to spreading depolarization (SD), a recognized principle of ischemic lesion development has also been found to be reduced by aging. Here, we set out to investigate whether the SD-coupled reactivity of the pial arterioles is subject to aging, and whether concomitant vascular rarefaction may contribute to the age-related insufficiency of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response. CBF was assessed with laser-speckle contrast analysis (LASCA), and the tone adjustment of pial arterioles was followed with intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging at green light illumination through a closed cranial window created over the parietal cortex of isoflurane-anesthetized young (2 months old) and old (18 months old) male Sprague-Dawley rats. Global forebrain ischemia and later reperfusion were induced by the bilateral occlusion and later release of both common carotid arteries. SDs were elicited repeatedly with topical 1M KCl. Pial vascular density was measured in green IOS images of the brain surface, while the density and resting diameter of the cortical penetrating vasculature was estimated with micro-computed tomography of paraformaldehyde-fixed cortical samples. Whilst pial arteriolar dilation in response to SD or ischemia induction were found reduced in the old rat brain, the density and resting diameter of pial cortical vessels, and the degree of SD-related oligemia emerged as variables unaffected by age in our experiments. Spatial flow distribution analysis identified an age-related shift to a greater representation of higher flow ranges in the reperfused cortex. According to our data, impairment of functional arteriolar dilation, at preserved vascular density and resting vascular tone, may be implicated in the age-related deficit of the CBF response to SD, and possibly in the reduced efficacy of neurovascular coupling in the aging brain. SD has been recognized as a potent pathophysiological contributor to ischemic lesion expansion, in part because of the insufficiency of the associated CBF response. Therefore, the age-related impairment of cerebral vasoreactivity as shown here is suggested to contribute to the age-related acceleration of ischemic lesion development.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Bálint, Puskás, Menyhárt, Kozák, Szenti, Kónya, Marek, Bari and Farkas.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Treatment using aminoglycoside antibiotics for infection and exposure to loud sounds contribute to the degeneration of cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Cell loss impacts cochlear function and causes hearing loss in ∼ 15% of adult Americans (∼36 million). The number of individuals with hearing loss will likely grow with increasing lifespans. Current prosthesis such as hearing aids and cochlear implants can ameliorate hearing loss. However, hearing aids are ineffective if hair cells or spiral ganglion neurons are severely damaged, and cochlear implants are ineffective without properly functioning spiral ganglion neurons. As such, strategies that alleviate hearing loss by preventing degeneration or promoting cell replacement are urgently needed. Despite showing great promise from <i>in vitro</i> studies, the complexity and delicate nature of the inner ear poses a huge challenge for delivering therapeutics. To mitigate risks and complications associated with surgery, new technologies and methodologies have emerged for efficient delivery of therapeutics. We will focus on biomaterials that allow controlled and local drug delivery into the inner ear.

Aging also causes impairment of cognition. To understand whether new neurons contribute to learning and memory, we performed experiments on young and aged laboratory opossums, <i>Monodelphis domestica</i>, and examined the association between spatial memory using the Morris water maze test and the rate of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Modification of this test allowed us to assess how both young and aged opossums learn and remember the location of the platform in the water maze. We found that both young and aged opossums were motivated to perform this task. However, aged opossums needed more time to achieve the test than young opossums. Classical parameters measuring spatial learning in a water maze during a probe test showed that young opossums spent more time in the platform zone crossing it more often than aged opossums. Additionally, hippocampal neurogenesis was lower in the aged opossums than in the young animals but new neurons were still generated in the DG of aged opossums. Our data revealed individual differences in the levels of doublecortin in relation to memory performance across aged opossums. These differences were correlated with distinct behaviors, particularly, aged opossums with high levels of DCX achieved high performance levels in the water maze task.

It sculpts excitatory signals and prevents hyperexcitability of neurons. Owing to these essential functions, dysregulated synaptic inhibition causes a plethora of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. Among these disorders, epilepsy is associated with abnormal hyperexcitability of neurons caused by the deficits of GABAergic neuron or decreased GABAergic inhibition at synapses. Although many antiepileptic drugs are intended to improve GABA-mediated inhibition, the molecular mechanisms of synaptic inhibition regulated by GABAergic neurons are not fully understood. Increasing evidence indicates that phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) is involved in the generation of seizure, while the causal relationship between PLCγ1 and seizure has not been firmly established yet. Here, we show that genetic deletion of PLCγ1 in GABAergic neurons leads to handling-induced seizure in aged mice. In addition, aged Plcg1<sup>F/F</sup>; Dlx5/6-Cre mice exhibit other behavioral alterations, including hypoactivity, reduced anxiety, and fear memory deficit. Notably, inhibitory synaptic transmission as well as the number of inhibitory synapses are decreased in the subregions of hippocampus. These findings suggest that PLCγ1 may be a key determinant of maintaining both inhibitory synapses and synaptic transmission, potentially contributing to the regulation of E/I balance in the hippocampus.</AbstractText>"}

Their 'front-line' status and longevity of relationships meant that carers felt they possessed important forms of knowledge relevant to medication decisions. Both groups of carers valued decision-making in which they felt they had a voice and a genuine role. While some in each group described making joint decisions about medication with psychiatrists, lack of involvement was often described. This took three forms in participants' accounts: being uninformed of important facts, insufficiently included in discussions and lacking influence to shape decisions.

Here we assessed such associations among 395,651 elderly Chinese in Ningbo, China where air pollution exposures are high and the proportion of elderly in the population is growing. We utilized a regional health information database in China (2008-2017) that collected information on hospital visits for sleep disorders among the elderly (age 60+). Measures of daily air pollution concentrations including nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), inhalable particles (PM<sub>10</sub>), and ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were generated from seven environmental air quality monitoring sites in the study area. We used a generalized additive model to evaluate the associations between hospital visits for sleep disorders and short-term air pollution exposures for up to 7 days prior to a hospital visit. Short-term exposure to multiple air pollutants was associated with hospital visits for sleep disorders in an elderly population; with the strongest associations during 2-3 days prior to a clinic visits for traffic-related pollutants including air quality index (AQI), PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> and for SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for 5 days prior to the visits. Our study based on large health care record system suggested that short-term air pollution exposures are associated with sleep disorders in the elderly. Considering the individual covariates that could not be adjusted in time-series analyses, future studies with individual level data and an ability to evaluate the severity of sleep disorders and their relation to mental and physical health in general and air pollution are needed. An aging population with increasing health problems and the frequency of high and very high air pollution events in China make our findings very health policy relevant.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although several detailed assessment tools have been developed and validated in the geriatric population, they are cumbersome, not validated in patients with HF, and not commonly used in routine management of patients with HF. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in developing simple frailty screening tools that could efficiently and quickly identify frail patients with HF in routine clinical settings. As the burden and recognition of frailty in older patients with HF increase, a more comprehensive approach to management is needed that targets deficits across multiple domains, including physical function and medical, cognitive, and social domains. Such a multidomain approach is critical to address the unique, multidimensional challenges to the care of these high-risk patients and to improve their functional status, quality of life, and long-term clinical outcomes. This review discusses the burden of frailty, the conceptual underpinnings of frailty in older patients with HF, and potential strategies for the assessment, screening, and management of frailty in this vulnerable patient population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

In high-adherence nursing homes, (1) there was more perceived patient and family willingness to engage in the program (Participant Responsiveness), (2) champions supplemented the video with ACP conversations (Quality of Delivery), (3) there were strategic approaches to recruitment (Recruitment), and (4) champions appreciated external facilitation (Strategies to Facilitate Implementation).</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>Critical lessons for implementing pRCTs in nursing homes emerged from this report: (1) flexible fidelity is important (i.e., delivering core elements of an intervention while permitting the adaptation of non-core elements), (2) reciprocal facilitation is vital (i.e., early and ongoing stakeholder engagement in research design and, reciprocally, researchers' and organizational leaders' ongoing support of the implementation), and (3) organizational and champion readiness should be formally assessed early and throughout implementation to facilitate remediation.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='TRIAL REGISTRATION' NlmCategory='BACKGROUND'>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02612688.

In this work, we present a design of an ultrafast QCMD with submillisecond time resolution. It is based on a frequency comb approach applied to a high-fundamental-frequency (HFF) resonator through a multifrequency lock-in amplifier.

Based on measurements of pervaporation transients, for which a new apparatus and model were developed, we found that the diffusivity of 1-butanol in PTMSP decreased over time due to aging and was comparable to that observed using microgravimetry in pure vapor in 1-butanol. Hence, despite the gradual loss of free volume of the aging polymer, the PTMSP membrane showed high and practically independent selectivity towards 1-butanol.

The enzyme esterifies plasma cholesterol and increases the capacity of HDL to carry and potentially remove cholesterol from tissues. Cholesterol accumulates within the extracellular connective tissue matrix of the cornea stroma in individuals with genetic deficiency of LCAT. LCAT can be activated by apolipoproteins (Apo) including ApoD and ApoA1. ApoA1 also mediates cellular synthesis of HDL. This study examined the expression of LCAT by epithelial cells, keratocytes, and endothelial cells, the cell types that comprise from anterior to posterior the three layers of the cornea. LCAT and ApoD were immunolocalized to all three cell types within the cornea, while ApoA1 was immunolocalized to keratocytes and endothelium but not epithelium. In situ hybridization was used to detect LCAT, ApoD, and ApoA1 mRNA to learn what cell types within the cornea synthesize these proteins. No corneal cells showed mRNA for ApoA1. Keratocytes and endothelium both showed ApoD mRNA, but epithelium did not. Epithelium and endothelium both showed LCAT mRNA, but despite the presence of LCAT protein in keratocytes, keratocytes did not show LCAT mRNA. RNA sequencing analysis of serum-cultured dedifferentiated keratocytes (commonly referred to as corneal stromal fibroblasts) revealed the presence of both LCAT and ApoD (but not ApoA1) mRNA, which was accompanied by their respective proteins detected by immunolabeling of the cultured keratocytes and Western blot analysis of keratocyte lysates. The results indicate that keratocytes in vivo show both ApoA1 and LCAT proteins, but do not synthesize these proteins.

As NAD+ status is critical in maintaining cellular energy, vitamin B3 deficiency mainly affects tissues that need high cellular energy causing pellagra and skin sun sensitivity. In animal models, NAD+ deficiency leads to UV sensitivity of the skin, impairs DNA damage response, and increases genomic instability and cancer incidence. Furthermore, NAD+ depletion is associated with human skin aging and cancer. NAM prevents the UV-induced ATP depletion boosting cellular energy and enhances DNA repair activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, NAM reduces skin cancer incidence and prevents the immune-suppressive effects of UV in mice. Thus, NAM is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and may have beneficial effects against skin aging changes and tumor development. Clinical studies showed that topical use of NAM reduces cutaneous aging. Furthermore, oral NAM administration reduces the level of UV-mediated immunosuppression and lowers the rate of non-melanoma skin cancers in high-risk patients. Therefore, NAM replenishment strategy may be a promising approach for skin cancer chemoprevention.</AbstractText>"}

There have been some epidemiological studies of osteoarthritis conducted in one single site, and most of them were on knee osteoarthritis. The results varied greatly between different surveys. There was still a lack of large-scale and multicenter epidemiological studies of osteoarthritis. This paper aimed to estimate the overall prevalence of lumbar osteoarthritis, cervical osteoarthritis, hand osteoarthritis, knee osteoarthritis, and hip osteoarthritis in the middle-aged and elderly in China by summarizing the existing publications. <i>Methods</i>: We comprehensively searched publications on 1 January 2019 in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CBM, CNNI, VIP, and Wan Fang. Epidemiological publications on osteoarthritis in the middle-aged and elderly Chinese published from 2000 to 2018 were summarized and analyzed by means of systematic review and meta-analysis. Data of prevalence of osteoarthritis in five joints were extracted from the included publications. The Hoy 2012 tool was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. <i>Results</i>: After performing a systematic search in eight databases and manually searching, 3058 articles were obtained, and 21 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Lumbar osteoarthritis was the most prevalent with a prevalence of 25.03% (95% CI: 0.1444-0.3562). The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis followed, which was 21.51% (95% CI: 0.1873-0.2429). The prevalence of cervical osteoarthritis was 20.46% (95% CI: 0.1244-0.2849). The prevalence of hand osteoarthritis was 8.99% (95% CI: 0.0435-0.1364). The prevalence of hip osteoarthritis was not pooled due to its lack of data. Higher prevalence of knee, hand, lumbar, and cervical osteoarthritis was seen in the female group and southern regions. The prevalence of knee and hand osteoarthritis increased with age. The prevalence of lumbar and cervical osteoarthritis increased with age. There was also a trend that the prevalence increased with age before 70 years old and slightly decreased in the oldest ages. <b>Conclusions</b>: The lumbar joint was the joint most prevalently affected by osteoarthritis, followed by the prevalence of knee, cervical, hand, and hip joint osteoarthritis. Women, the southern population, and the older population are more susceptible to osteoarthritis. The paucity of epidemiology data of osteoarthritis in China appeals for more population-based surveys being conducted in the future. Based on the relatively high prevalence of osteoarthritis obtained from this review, self-management and community-based management should be considered, which can provide experience from the management of hypertensions and diabetes.</AbstractText>"}

Articular chondrocytes, obtained from (metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal) joints of different aged horses, were cultured in monolayer for several passages (P0 to P8). Cumulative Populations Doublings Levels (PDL) and gene expression of relevant chondrocyte phenotypic markers were analysed during culturing. Overall data confirmed that, during proliferation in vitro, horse chondrocytes undergo marked morphological and phenotypic alterations of their differentiation status. Particularly, the dedifferentiation started early in culture (P0-P1) and was very marked at P3 subculture (PDL 4-6): proliferative phase after P3 could be critical for maintenance/loss of differentiation potential. In elderly animals, chondrocytes showed aspects of dedifferentiation shortly after their isolation, associated with reduced proliferative capacity. Regarding the gene expression of major cartilage markers (Col2, Aggrecan, SOX9) there was a very early reduction (P1) in proliferating chondrocytes independent of age. The chondrocytes from adult donors showed a more stable expression (up to P3) of some (Col6, Fibromodulin, SOX6, TGβ1) markers of mature cartilage; these markers could be tested as parameter to determine the dedifferentiation level. This study can provide parameters to identify up to which 'culture step' chondrocytes for implantation with a conserved phenotypic potential can be obtained, and to test the efficiency of biomaterial scaffold or chondroinductive media/signals to maintain/recover the chondrocyte phenotype. Moreover, the determination of levels and time related expression of these markers can be useful during the chondroinduction of mesenchymal stem cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether inhibition of p53 using pifithrin (PFT)-α or PFT-μ provides neuroprotective effects via p53 transcriptional dependent or -independent mechanisms, respectively. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact TBI followed by the administration of PFTα or PFT-μ (2 mg/kg, i.v.) at 5 h after TBI. Brain contusion volume, as well as sensory and motor functions were evaluated at 24 h after TBI. TBI-induced impairments were mitigated by both PFT-α and PFT-μ. Fluoro-Jade C staining was used to label degenerating neurons within the TBI-induced cortical contusion region that, together with Annexin V positive neurons, were reduced by PFT-μ. Double immunofluorescence staining similarly demonstrated that PFT-μ significantly increased HO-1 positive neurons and mRNA expression in the cortical contusion region as well as decreased numbers of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE)-positive cells. Levels of mRNA encoding for p53, autophagy, mitophagy, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory related genes and proteins were measured by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. PFT-α, but not PFT-μ, significantly lowered p53 mRNA expression. Both PFT-α and PFT-μ lowered TBI-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) mRNA levels as well as TBI-induced autophagic marker localization (LC3 and p62). Finally, treatment with PFT-μ mitigated TBI-induced declines in mRNA levels of PINK-1 and SOD2. Our data suggest that both PFT-μ and PFT-α provide neuroprotective actions through regulation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, autophagy, and mitophagy mechanisms, and that PFT-μ, in particular, holds promise as a TBI treatment strategy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

The UPS can also regulate protein synthesis by influencing multiple steps of RNA (ribonucleic acid) metabolism. Here, recent publications concerning the interplay between the UPS and different types of RNA are reviewed. This interplay mainly involves specific RNA-binding E3 ligases that link RNA-dependent processes with protein ubiquitylation.

{"PMID":31778221,"Title":"Interventions for preventing falls in people with multiple sclerosis.","Journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Date":"Nov 28 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText Label='BACKGROUND' NlmCategory='BACKGROUND'>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most prevalent diseases of the central nervous system with recent prevalence estimates indicating that MS directly affects 2.3 million people worldwide. Fall rates of 56% have been reported among people with MS in a recent meta-analysis. Clinical guidelines do not outline an evidence-based approach to falls interventions in MS. There is a need for synthesised information regarding the effectiveness of falls prevention interventions in MS.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='OBJECTIVES' NlmCategory='OBJECTIVE'>The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce falls in people with MS. Specific objectives included comparing: (1) falls prevention interventions to controls and; (2) different types of falls prevention interventions.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='SEARCH METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>We searched the Trials Register of the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2018 Issue 9); MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966 to 12 September 2018); Embase (EMBASE.com) (1974 to 12 September 2018); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCOhost) (1981 to 12 September 2018); Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (Bireme) (1982 to 12 September 2018); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; PsycINFO (1806 to 12 September 2018; and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (1999 to 12 September 2018).</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='SELECTION CRITERIA' NlmCategory='METHODS'>We selected randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in people with MS. We included trials that examined falls prevention interventions compared to controls or different types of falls prevention interventions. Primary outcomes included: falls rate, risk of falling, number of falls per person and adverse events.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95% confidence interval to compare falls rate between groups. For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI based on the number of fallers in each group.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='MAIN RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>A total of 839 people with MS (12 to 177 individuals) were randomised in the 13 included trials. The mean age of the participants was 52 years (36 to 62 years). The percentage of women participants ranged from 59% to 85%. Studies included people with all types of MS. Most trials compared an exercise intervention with no intervention or different types of falls prevention interventions. We included two comparisons: (1) Falls prevention intervention versus control and (2) Falls prevention intervention versus another falls prevention intervention. The most common interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention, education as a single intervention, functional electrical stimulation and exercise plus education. The risk of bias of the included studies mixed, with nine studies demonstrating high risk of bias related to one or more aspects of their methodology. The evidence was uncertain regarding the effects of exercise versus control on falls rate (RaR of 0.68; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.06; very low-quality evidence), number of fallers (RR of 0.85; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.43; low-quality evidence) and adverse events (RR of 1.25; 95% CI 0.26 to 6.03; low-quality evidence). Data were not available on quality of life outcomes comparing exercise to control. The majority of other comparisons between falls interventions and controls demonstrated no evidence of effect in favour of either group for all primary outcomes. For the comparison of different falls prevention interventions, the heterogeneity of intervention types across studies prohibited the pooling of data. In relation to secondary outcomes, there was evidence of an effect in favour of exercise interventions compared to controls for balance function with a SMD of 0.50 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.92), self-reported mobility with a SMD of 16.30 (95% CI 9.34 to 23.26) and objective mobility with a SMD of 0.28 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.50). Secondary outcomes were not assessed under the GRADE criteria and results must be interpreted with caution.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>The evidence regarding the effects of interventions for preventing falls in MS is sparse and uncertain. The evidence base demonstrates mixed risk of bias, with very low to low certainty of the evidence. There is some evidence in favour of exercise interventions for the improvement of balance function and mobility. However, this must be interpreted with caution as these secondary outcomes were not assessed under the GRADE criteria and as the results represent data from a small number of studies. Robust RCTs examining the effectiveness of multifactorial falls interventions on falls outcomes are needed.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study explored whether WMH lesion volume mediates the relationship between cerebral patterns of GMv and cognition in 521 (mean age 57.7 years) cognitively unimpaired middle-aged individuals. Episodic memory (EM) was measured with the Memory Binding Test and executive functions (EF) using five WAIS-IV subtests. WMH were automatically determined from T2 and FLAIR sequences and characterized using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) parameters. WMH volume was entered as a mediator in a voxel-wise mediation analysis relating GMv and cognitive performance (with both EM and EF composites and the individual tests independently). The mediation model was corrected by age, sex, education, number of Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 alleles and total intracranial volume. We found that even at very low levels of WMH burden in the cohort (median volume of 3.2 mL), higher WMH lesion volume was significantly associated with a widespread pattern of lower GMv in temporal, frontal, and cerebellar areas. WMH mediated the relationship between GMv and EF, mainly driven by processing speed, but not EM. DWI parameters in these lesions were compatible with incipient demyelination and axonal loss. These findings lead to the reflection on the relevance of the control of cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged individuals as a valuable preventive strategy to reduce or delay cognitive decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Bryce and Dodson (2013, Psychology and Aging, 28, 87, Exp 2) provided support for the social-cognitive account, demonstrating an OAB for participants who encountered a mixed-list of own- and other-age faces, but not for participants who encountered a pure-list of only own- or other-age faces. They proposed that own-age/other-age categorization, and the resulting OAB, only emerge when age is made salient in the mixed-list condition. Our study aimed to replicate this finding using methods typically used to investigate the OAB to examine their robustness and contribution to our understanding of how the OAB forms. Across three experiments that removed theoretically unimportant components of the original paradigm, varied face sex, and included background scenes, the OAB emerged under both mixed-list and pure-list conditions. These results are more consistent with a perceptual-expertise than social-cognitive account of the OAB, but may suggest that manipulating age salience using mixed-list and pure-list presentations is not sufficient to alter categorization processes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The British Psychological Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

A higher proportion of women were diagnosed with OA, whereas greater incidence in men was estimated for the hand and hip. Foot OA presented comparable diagnosis numbers to the hand. More recently during 2012/2013 to 2017/2018, a significant rise in hip OA was estimated among younger adults, whereas knee OA decreased across all age groups.

Further detailed data may be particularly important for the hip, which represents significant incidence among younger adults. Greater incidence of OA in the foot compared with the knee emphasizes the need for well-conducted epidemiological research in this area. Monitoring the performance of surgical outcomes at the population-level for this frequently affected yet understudied site could have substantial potential to reduce the socioeconomic burden it represents to the NHS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In the late 1980s, after the signing of the Ottawa Charter for health promotion, the Swiss Confederation and the cantons decided to create a foundation whose goal it was to initiate, coordinate and evaluate health promotion and disease prevention activities throughout the country. Thirty years later, the many stakeholders in the field have accepted health Promotion Switzerland as a key actor. The foundation was able to successfully initiate and coordinate projects in such priority areas as 'Healthy Body Weight,' 'Mental Health -Stress' and 'Strengthening Health Promotion &amp; Prevention.'

Understanding species' germination thresholds is key for conservation and restoration initiatives. Thus, we investigated the role of water availability in the germination traits of keystone species in an arid ecosystem with stochastic rainfall. We measured seed germination responses of five arid species, along gradients of temperature and water potential under controlled laboratory conditions. We then identified the cardinal temperatures and base water potentials for seed germination, and applied the hydrotime model to assess germination responses to water stress. Optimum temperatures for germination ranged from 15 to 31 °C under saturated conditions (0 MPa), and three species had low minimum temperatures for germination (&lt;3 °C). A small proportion of seeds of all species germinated under dry conditions (Ψ ≤ -1 MPa), although base water potential for germination (Ψ <sub>b</sub>50) ranged from -0.61 to -0.79 MPa. Species adhered to one of two germination traits: (i) the risk-takers which require less moisture availability for germination, and which can germinate over a wider range of temperatures irrespective of water availability (<i>Casuarina pauper</i> and <i>Maireana pyramidata</i>), and (ii) the risk-avoiders which have greater moisture requirements, a preference for cold climate germination, and narrower temperature ranges for germination when water availability is low (<i>Atriplex rhagodioides</i>, <i>Maireana sedifolia</i> and <i>Hakea leucoptera</i>). High seed longevity under physiological stress in <i>H. leucoptera</i>, combined with a risk-avoiding strategy, allows bet-hedging. The hydrotime model predicted lower base water potentials for germination than observed by the data, further supporting our assertion that these species have particular adaptations to avoid germination during drought. This study provides insights into the complex physiological responses of seeds to environmental stress, and relates seed germination traits to community dynamics and restoration in arid zones.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of rats induce an LH surge for ovulation, and those in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) regulate pulsatile LH secretion for follicle development and spermatogenesis. Dysfunction of kisspeptin neurons thus reduces the reproductive function. This review focuses on the effect of androgen or aging on kisspeptin expression in rats. Although androgen directly suppresses ARC kisspeptin neurons in female rats, the AVPV kisspeptin neurons are hardly affected. In rats, plasma LH concentrations decrease in both sexes with aging, and ARC kisspeptin expression also decreases in old rats compared with young rats. In addition, kisspeptin neurons may be associated with hyperprolactinemia in old female rats because they are known to release prolactin through hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons. Hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons are thus the main regulator to secrete LH, and inhibition of kisspeptin expression leads to various kinds of reproductive dysfunction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>2019 The Japan Society of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We have previously expressed the full-length human APP in Drosophila and established a fly AD model that exhibits multiple AD-like symptoms. Here we report that depletion of CHIP effectively palliated APP-induced pathological symptoms, including morphological, behavioral, and cognitive defects. Mechanistically, CHIP is required for APP-induced autophagy dysfunction, which promotes Aβ production via increased expression of BACE and Psn. Our findings suggest that aberrant autophagy is not only a consequence of abnormal APP activity, but also contributes to dysregulated APP metabolism and subsequent AD pathogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Volunteers supported clients through goal setting, motivation, education and connections to community resources and primary care. This study aimed to create and apply a volunteer program evaluation framework to explore: (a) volunteer training effectiveness (learning online content, in-person training, self-efficacy in role tasks, training overall); (b) feasibility of program implementation (process measures, reflections on client encounters, understanding of volunteer roles/responsibilities, client perspectives on volunteer program); and (c) effects of volunteering on volunteers (health outcomes, self-efficacy, value of volunteering). A concurrent triangulation, mixed-methods design was used. Data were collected in 2016, sources included: volunteer online training quizzes, focus groups, self-efficacy survey, Veterans RAND 12-Item (VR-12) survey, in-person training feedback forms and narratives of client visits; client interviews; and quantitative implementation data. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, paired samples t tests, and effect size (Cohen's d). Qualitative data used descriptive thematic analysis. Nineteen volunteers and 12 clients participated in this evaluation. Findings demonstrate the volunteer program evaluation framework in action. Online training increased knowledge. In-person training received largely positive evaluations. Self-efficacy was high post-training and higher after volunteering. VR-12 sub-scale means increased descriptively. Volunteers understood themselves as healthcare system connectors, feeling fulfilled with their contributions and learning new skills. They identified barriers including not having the resources and skills of healthcare professionals.

Mounting evidence indicates that autophagy plays a key role in aging and aging-related diseases. Enhanced autophagy can delay aging and prolong life span. The absence of autophagy leads to the accumulation of mutant and misfolded proteins in the cell, which is the basis for the emergence and development of neurodegenerative diseases and other aging-related diseases.

Protein synthesis and degradation coordinately regulate protein homeostasis. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) was the first lysosomal process to be discovered by which intracellular components are selectively degraded. This process involves the recognition of the substrate, the unfolding and translocation of the substrate, and the degradation of the substrate. By degrading specific target proteins in a timely manner, CMA is involved in a variety of cellular activities. In the past few years, we have acquired a better understanding of how CMA is regulated. It has been reported that peroxide accumulation, aging and/or other pathological signals interfere with CMA function, which in turn induces neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and other diseases. Combining results from the current research, we summarize the basic processes, regulatory mechanisms, and physiological functions of CMA and discuss its critical role in the development of diseases.</AbstractText>"}

In the 1990s, Ohsumi et al. identified multiple autophagy-related genes in a yeast model. Functional homologues of almost all yeast autophagy-related genes were found in higher eukaryotes. In 2003, Klionsky et al. named these genes the Atg genes and studied the interactions between the proteins they encoded and their functions in autophagy. In April 2005, a new journal, Autophagy, was published that was edited by Klionsky. The number of autophagy research papers indexed by PubMed has increased each year. In 2016, Yoshinori Ohsumi won the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for his discovery of the autophagy mechanism. Autophagy has thus become a hot research area, which involves biology, medicine, botany and microbiology. Many researchers are actively exploring the relationship between non-selective and selective autophagy and various pathophysiological states in humans, and are studying the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy regulation in various biological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, immune responses, development and ageing. This chapter focuses on the history and current status of autophagy research and highlights the milestones that contributed to the development of the field.</AbstractText>"}

The underlying premise is that the world's majority-who have the minority of financial capital-are living on the margins and are the most vulnerable and at risk from climate change. Such a reality, coupled with a deficit understanding of the majority world, is resulting in significant implications for how the 'adaptation industry' (those that fund, design and implement projects) go about their work. Drawing on research evaluating 15 community-based adaptation projects in Vanuatu we found that despite genuine attempts, projects invariably fell short of success, longevity and sustainability. We argue that the indifferent, albeit variable, success of most projects is attributable to the construction of the geographical scale of 'community-based' and the deficit view flowing down to the 'community' through hubris policy, funding guidelines and individual implementers. Our findings show that 'experts' are working in Pacific communities, conducting assessments that involve asking what 'community' needs are, going away to design projects, coming back and implementing projects, which communities are inevitably challenged to sustain once funding has ceased. We postulate that these limitations stem from such a formation of adaptation work that pejoratively fails to see Pacific Islanders in situ as the best litmus test of their own agendas, needs, aspirations and futures and in the best position to make decisions for themselves about what and how they might become more resilient. We claim from a growing body of evidence and new frontiers in research that, rather than adaptation being 'community-based', it needs to be 'locally led', not limited to 'communities', and should take place across different entry points and incorporate, as appropriate, elements of autonomous/Indigenous peoples ownership.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies, however, have not ensured that gait stability pre-perturbation was equivalent across participants or age groups which may have influenced the outcomes. In this study, we investigate if age-related differences in stability following gait perturbations remain when all participants walk with equivalent stability. We also examine if interlimb transfer of gait adaptations are observed in healthy older adults, by examining if adaptation to repeated perturbations of one leg can benefit stability recovery when the other leg is perturbed. During walking at their stability-normalised walking speeds (young: 1.32 ± 0.07 m/s; older: 1.31 ± 0.13 m/s; normalised to an average margin of stability of 0.05 m), 30 young and 28 older healthy adults experienced ten unpredictable treadmill belt accelerations (the first and last applied to the right leg, the others to the left leg). Using kinematic data, we assessed the margins of stability during unperturbed walking and the first eight post-perturbation recovery steps. Older adults required three more steps to recover during the first perturbation to each leg than the young adults. Yet, after repeated perturbations of the left leg, older adults required only one more step to recover. Interestingly, for the untrained right leg, the older adults could regain stability with three fewer steps, indicating interlimb transfer of the improvements. Age differences in reactive gait stability remain even when participants' walk with equivalent stability. Furthermore, we show that healthy older adults can transfer improvements in balance recovery made during repeated perturbations to one limb to their recovery following a perturbation to the untrained limb.</AbstractText>"}

The standard laboratory temperature (20-22 °C), however, imposes a cold stress on mice that causes an increase in sympathetic nervous system-mediated activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to maintain a core body temperature of 36-37 °C. Thus, while physiologic data obtained recapitulate human physiology to a certain degree, interpretations of previous research in mice may have been contaminated by a cold stress, due to housing mice below their thermoneutral zone (30 °C). The purpose of this investigation was to examine how chronic sympathetic stimulation evoked by acclimation to 20 °C might obscure interpretation of changes in autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) that accompany advancing age. HR and HRV before and after administration of a dual-autonomic blockade were measured via in-vivo ECG in young (3 months) and aged (30 months) male C57BL/6 telemetry-implanted mice following temperature acclimation for 3 days at 30 °C or 20 °C. Mean basal and intrinsic HR of both young and aged mice became markedly reduced at 30 °C compared to 20 °C. In both age groups, HRV parameters in time, frequency, and non-linear domains displayed increased variability at 30 °C compared to 20 °C under basal conditions. Importantly, age-associated declines in HRV observed at 20 °C were ameliorated when mice were studied at their thermoneutral ambient temperature of 30 °C. Thus, an accurate understanding of autonomic modulation of cardiovascular functions in mice of advanced age requires that they are housed in a metabolically neutral environment.</AbstractText>"}

Dicotyledonous angiosperms commonly possess a hierarchical leaf vascular system, wherein veins of different orders have different functions. Minor vein spacing determines leaf hydraulic efficiency, whereas the major veins provide mechanical support. However, there is limited information on the coordination between these vein orders across species, limiting our understanding of how diversity in vein architecture is arrayed. We aimed to examine the (1) relationships between vein densities at two spatial scales (lower- vs. higher-order veins and among minor veins) and (2) relationships of vein densities with plant functional traits. We studied ten traits related to vein densities and three functional traits (leaf dry mass per area [LMA], leaf longevity [LL], and adult plant height [H<sub>adult</sub>]) for 227 phylogenetically diverse plant species that occur in temperate regions and examined the vein-vein and vein-functional traits relationships across species. The densities of lower- and higher-order veins were positively correlated across species. The minor vein density was positively correlated with the densities of both areoles and free-ending veins, and vascular networks with higher minor vein density tended to have a lower ratio of free-ending veins to areoles across species. Neither densities of lower- nor higher-order veins were related to LMA and LL. On the other hand, the densities of veins and areoles tended to be positively correlated with H<sub>adult</sub>. These results suggest that densities of different-order veins are developmentally coordinated across dicotyledonous angiosperms and form the independent axis in resource use strategies based on the leaf economics spectrum.</AbstractText>"}

In this study we investigated whether NADPH exerted cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. To induce myocardial I/R injury, rats were subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending branch of coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. At the onset of reperfusion, NADPH (4, 8, 16 mg· kg<sup>-1</sup>· d<sup>-1</sup>, iv) was administered to the rats. We found that NADPH concentrations in plasma and heart were significantly increased at 4 h after intravenous administration. Exogenous NADPH (8-16 mg/kg) significantly decreased myocardial infarct size and reduced serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I). Exogenous NADPH significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes, and reduced the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. In addition, exogenous NADPH reduced mitochondrial vacuolation and increased mitochondrial membrane protein COXIV and TOM20, decreased BNIP3L and increased Bcl-2 to protect mitochondrial function. We conducted in vitro experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/restoration (OGD/R). Pretreatment with NADPH (60, 500 nM) significantly rescued the cell viability and inhibited OGD/R-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with NADPH significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and downregulated the phosphorylation of mTOR in OGD/R-treated NRCM. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, abolished NADPH-induced AMPK phosphorylation and cardioprotection in OGD/R-treated NRCM. In conclusion, exogenous NADPH exerts cardioprotection against myocardial I/R injury through the activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway and inhibiting mitochondrial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. NADPH may be a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemic diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Previous reports have demonstrated an increase in microgliosis and astrogliosis in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice before the onset of symptoms, a neuroinflammatory response which correlated with disease progression. Importantly, early stage homeostatic microglia enhanced motor neuron survival, while pro-inflammatory microglia were toxic to motor neurons in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Recent studies from our group have demonstrated that cromolyn sodium, an FDA approved compound, exerts neuroprotective effects in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease by altering microglial cell activation. Here, we tested the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of cromolyn sodium in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. Our results indicate that cromolyn sodium treatment significantly delayed the onset of neurological symptoms, and improved deficits in PaGE performance in both male and female mice, however, there was only an effect on survival in female mice. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in motor neuron survival in the lumbar spinal cord as well as a significant decrease in the denervation of the neuromuscular junction of the tibialis anterior muscle in cromolyn treated transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Lastly, cromolyn treatment decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lumbar spinal cord and plasma and decreased mast cell degranulation in the tibialis anterior muscle of transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Together, these findings suggest that cromolyn sodium provides neuroprotection in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice by decreasing the inflammatory response.</AbstractText>"}

Persistent accumulation of damaged mitochondria has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. One highly conserved mechanism to clear damaged mitochondria involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), which cooperatively initiate the process called mitophagy that identifies and eliminates damaged mitochondria through the autophagosome and lysosome pathways. Parkin is a mostly cytosolic protein, but is rapidly recruited to damaged mitochondria and target them for mitophagy. Moreover, Parkin interactomes also involve signaling pathways and transcriptional machinery critical for survival and cell death. However, the mechanism that regulates Parkin protein level remains poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) in neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) has broad protective effect from cell death induced by mitochondrial toxins. The mechanism by which <i>Hipk2<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons and MEFs are more resistant to mitochondrial toxins is in part due to the role of HIPK2 and its kinase activity in promoting Parkin degradation via the proteasome-mediated mechanism. Loss of HIPK2 leads to higher cytosolic Parkin protein level at basal conditions and upon exposure to mitochondrial toxins, which protects mitochondria from toxin-induced damage. In addition, <i>Hipk2<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons and MEFs show increased expression of PGC-1α, a Parkin downstream target that can provide additional benefits via transcriptional activation of mitochondrial genes. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized avenue to target HIPK2 in neuroprotection via Parkin-mediated pathway.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>In this study, we provide evidence that HIPK2 and its kinase activity promote Parkin degradation via the proteasome-mediated pathway. Loss of HIPK2 increases cytosolic and mitochondrial Parkin protein levels under basal condition and upon exposure to mitochondrial toxins, which protect mitochondria from toxin-induced damage. In addition, <i>Hipk2<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts also show increased expression of PGC-1α, a Parkin downstream target that can provide additional benefits via transcriptional activation of mitochondrial genes. These results indicate that targeting HIPK2 and its kinase activity can have neuroprotective effects by elevating Parkin protein levels.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

PROs can provide a first-hand assessment of the impact of HIV treatment and care on patients' quality of life, including symptoms. The field of PRO measures is rapidly expanding but still no gold standard exists, raising concerns about tool selection. Challenges also remain in the collection, interpretation, and use of PRO data to improve the performance of the health system.

However, people living with HIV have disproportionately high incidence of major comorbidities and reduced health-related quality of life. Health systems must respond to this situation by pioneering care and service delivery models that promote wellness rather than mere survival. In this Series paper, we review evidence about the emerging challenges of the care of people with HIV beyond viral suppression and identify four priority areas for action: integrating HIV services and non-HIV services, reducing HIV-related discrimination in health-care settings, identifying indicators to monitor health systems' progress toward new goals, and catalysing new forms of civil society engagement in the more broadly focused HIV response that is now needed worldwide. Furthermore, in the context of an increasing burden of chronic diseases, we must consider the shift that is underway in the HIV field in relation to burgeoning policy and programmatic efforts to promote healthy ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Anxiety is known to interact with cognitive resources and, as people get older, they require more cognitive resources to maintain balance. This might affect an individual's ability to perform cognitive-motor tasks concurrently. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a visuospatial dual-task on stepping performance in older people with and without concern about falling and the impact of repeating this task in those with high concern about falling.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>Three-hundred-eight community-dwelling older people, aged 70 to 90 years old, participated in the study. Participants were asked to perform a Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) task in two conditions; once without any other tasks (single task condition), and once while simultaneously performing a visuospatial task (dual-task condition). Participants were asked to rate their levels of concern and confidence specifically related to each of the 25 stepping trials (before/after). We also measured general concern about falling, affect, and sensorimotor and cognitive functioning.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>Total stepping reaction times increased when participants also performed the visuospatial task. The relation between general concern about falling and stepping reaction time, was affected by sensorimotor and executive functioning. Generalised linear mixed models showed that the group with moderate to high levels of general concern about falling had slower total stepping reaction times than those with lower levels of concern about falling, especially during the dual-task condition. Individuals with greater general concern about falling showed reduced confidence levels about whether they could do the stepping tasks under both conditions. Repeatedly performing the stepping task reduced the immediate task-specific concern about falling levels and increased confidence in all participants.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>These findings reveal that people with higher general concern about falling experienced more difficulties during a dual-task condition than people with lower levels of concern. Of further interest, better sensorimotor and cognitive functioning reduced this effect.

According to the different etiology, the pathogenesis of chronic wound is different, including both systemic factors and local factors. The treatment of chronic wound is a multi-disciplinary integrated treatment process, including internal medicine treatment, surgical treatment, vascular interventional therapy, platelet-rich plasma treatment, and biological therapy, etc. Each treatment regimen has its own indications and pros and cons. To make a treatment regimen, a combination of a variety of options should be chosen according to the patient's wound conditions. The traditional chronic wound treatment mode is multi-disciplinary team (MDT) treatment mode, which requires the participation of surgeons from multiple departments such as intervention department, plastic surgery department, orthopedics department, etc., and it is also the mainstream mode for treating chronic wound in western countries. According to the domestic medical situation and the experience of our department, we put forward the integrated surgical wound treatment (ISWT) mode, that is to integrate multiple surgical techniques of wound treatment. Compared with the traditional MDT treatment mode, to apply the ISWT mode can make a more reasonable treatment plan, improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment, shorten the hospitalization period, and improve the diagnosis and treatment ability of the team. With the increasing incidence of chronic wound, the ISWT mode needs to be further explored and improved, and the team needs more specialized experts to join in.</AbstractText>"}

Although it is well known that quercetin exhibits a range of biological activities, the mechanisms behind these activities remain unresolved. The aim of this work is to progress in the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the biological effects of quercetin using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model organism. With this aim, the nematode has been used to explore the ability of this flavonoid to modulate the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) signaling pathway (IIS) and the expression of some genes related to stress response. Different methodological approaches have been used, i.e., assays in knockout mutant worms, gene expression assessment by RT-qPCR, and <i>C. elegans</i> transgenic strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. The results showed that the improvement of the oxidative stress resistance of <i>C. elegans</i> induced by quercetin could be explained, at least in part, by the modulation of the insulin signaling pathway, involving genes <i>age-1, akt-1, akt-2, daf-18, sgk-1, daf-2</i>, and <i>skn-1</i>. However, this effect could be independent of the transcription factors DAF-16 and HSF-1 that regulate this pathway. Moreover, quercetin was also able to increase expression of <i>hsp-16.2</i> in aged worms. This observation could be of particular interest to explain the effects of enhanced lifespan and greater resistance to stress induced by quercetin in <i>C. elegans</i>, since the expression of many heat shock proteins diminishes in aging worms.</AbstractText>"}

To directly visualize and characterize α-syn oligomerization and spreading in vivo, we generated two independent conditional transgenic mouse models based on α-syn protein complementation assays using neuron-specifically expressed split Gaussia luciferase or split Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). These transgenic mice allow direct assessment of the quantity and subcellular distribution of α-syn oligomers in vivo. Using these mouse models, we demonstrate an age-dependent accumulation of a specific subtype of α-syn oligomers. We provide in vivo evidence that, although α-syn is found throughout neurons, α-syn oligomerization takes place at the presynapse. Furthermore, our mouse models provide strong evidence for a transsynaptic cell-to-cell transfer of de novo generated α-syn oligomers in vivo.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Given this knowledge gap about which retinal cells express complement, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on ∼92,000 mouse retinal cells and validated our results in five major purified retinal cell types. We found evidence for a distributed cell-type-specific complement expression across 11 cell types. Notably, Müller cells are the major contributor of complement activators c1s, c3, c4, and cfb. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mainly expresses cfh and the terminal complement components, whereas cfi and cfp transcripts are most abundant in neurons. Aging enhances c1s, cfb, cfp, and cfi expression, while cfh expression decreases. Transient retinal ischemia increases complement expression in microglia, Müller cells, and RPE. In summary, we report a unique complement expression signature for murine retinal cell types suggesting a well-orchestrated regulation of local complement expression in the retinal microenvironment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The GI network spans six annotated biological processes including aging, intracellular transport, microtubule-based processes, cytokinesis, lipid metabolic processes, and anatomical structure development. By proposing a strategy called 'reciprocal functional test' for interacting gene pairs, we discover a group of genes that mediate crosstalk between distinct biological processes. In particular, we identify the ribosomal S6 Kinase/RSKS-1, previously characterized as an mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) effector, as a regulator of DAF-2 endosomal recycling transport, which traces a functional correlation between endocytic recycling and aging processes.

The massive accumulation of diagnostic, procedure, and laboratory codes in one place has enabled the exploration of co-occurring conditions, their risk factors, and potential prognostic factors. While most of the readily identifiable associations in medical records are (now) well known to the scientific community, there is no doubt many more relationships are still to be uncovered in EMR data. In this paper, we introduce a novel finding index to help with that task. This new index uses data mined from real-time PubMed abstracts to indicate the extent to which empirically discovered associations are already known (i.e., present in the scientific literature). Our methods leverage second-generation p-values, which better identify associations that are truly clinically meaningful. We illustrate our new method with three examples: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer's Disease, and Optic Neuritis. Our results demonstrate wide utility for identifying new associations in EMR data that have the highest priority among the complex web of correlations and causalities.

Aging is one of the most important independent risk factors for worsened cognitive outcome, and this deterioration is linked to exacerbated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in the aged brain. Under pathological stimulation, microglia are capable of polarizing toward proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. In the present study, we examined how aging affects microglial responses and neuroinflammation following peripheral surgery. Adult (2-3 months) and aged (18 months old) male C57/BL6 mice were subjected to tibial fracture or sham surgery. Aged mice exhibited higher level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the hippocampus. The expression of synaptic protein synaptophysin (SYP) was also markedly reduced in the aged brain after the surgery. Both adult and aged mice showed significant increases in M1 microglial polarization (CD16/32). In contrast, tibial fracture surgery induced a decreased M2 microglial polarization (CD206, Ym1/2, Arg1) in aged brain but enhanced M2 microglial polarization in adult brain. Aged mice have upregulated voltage-gated proton channel (Hv1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit expression compared with adult mice. The percentage of CD16/32-positive M1 microglia colabeling with Hv1 was higher in aged mice after tibial fracture surgery. Thus, Hv1/NADPH oxidase upregulation in the aged brain may shift the dynamic equilibrium of microglial activation toward M1 polarization and exaggerate postoperative neuroinflammatory responses after peripheral surgical intervention.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

This model was simulated for isometric dorsiflexion, and comparative experiments were conducted for validation. Repeated simulations were performed to investigate the different parameters and evaluate inter-experimental variability. An equivalence statistical test and the Bland-Altman method were used to observe the significance between the simulated and experimental data.

All maltreatment phenotypes were partly heritable with percentages for <i>h</i><sup>2</sup> ranging from 30% (<i>SE</i> = 13%) for neglect to 62% (<i>SE</i> = 19%) for severe physical abuse. Common environmental effects (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>) explained a statistically significant proportion of variance for all phenotypes except for the experience of severe physical abuse (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = 9%, <i>SE</i> = 13%, <i>p</i> = .26). The genetic correlation between abuse and neglect was ρ<sub>g</sub> = .73 (<i>p</i> = .02). Common environmental variance increased as socioeconomic status (SES) decreased (<i>p</i> = .05), but additive genetic and unique environmental variances were constant across different levels of SES.</AbstractText>"}

This study presents the effects of berberine (BBR) on the aging process resulting in a promising extension of lifespan in model organisms. BBR extended the replicative lifespan, improved the morphology, and boosted rejuvenation markers of replicative senescence in human fetal lung diploid fibroblasts (2BS and WI38). BBR also rescued senescent cells with late population doubling (PD). Furthermore, the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive cell rates of late PD cells grown in the BBR-containing medium were ~72% lower than those of control cells, and its morphology resembled that of young cells. Mechanistically, BBR improved cell growth and proliferation by promoting entry of cell cycles from the G<sub>0</sub> or G<sub>1</sub> phase to S/G<sub>2</sub> -M phase. Most importantly, BBR extended the lifespan of chemotherapy-treated mice and naturally aged mice by ~52% and ~16.49%, respectively. The residual lifespan of the naturally aged mice was extended by 80%, from 85.5 days to 154 days. The oral administration of BBR in mice resulted in significantly improved health span, fur density, and behavioral activity. Therefore, BBR may be an ideal candidate for the development of an anti-aging medicine.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

This results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vitro and some in vivo studies suggest that oxidative damage of DNA caused by ROS is responsible for telomere shortening. Since telomere length is correlated with survival in many vertebrates, telomere loss is hypothesised to trigger cellular ageing and/ or to reflect the harshness of the environment an individual has experienced. To improve our understanding of stress-induced telomere dynamics in non-human vertebrates, we analysed 109 relevant studies in a meta-analytical framework. Overall, the exposure to possible stressors was associated with shorter telomeres or higher telomere shortening rate (average effect size = -0.16 ± 0.03). This relationship was consistent for all phylogenetic classes and for all a priori-selected stressor categories. It was stronger in the case of pathogen infection, competition, reproductive effort and high activity level, which emphasises their importance in explaining intraspecific telomere length variability and, potentially, lifespan variability. Interestingly, the association between stressor exposure and telomeres in one hand, and oxidative stress in the other hand, covaried, suggesting the implication of oxidative stress in telomere dynamics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd/CNRS.</CopyrightInformation>"}

With the historically increasing trends in some high-incidence populations reported to have stabilised in recent years, we aimed to assess recent trends and predict the future testicular cancer incidence burden across Europe. We extracted testicular cancer (ICD-10 C62) incidence data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volumes VII-XI and complemented this with data published by registries from 28 European countries. We predicted cancer incidence rates and the number of incident cases in Europe in the year 2035 using the NORDPRED age-period-cohort model. Testicular cancer incidence rates will increase in 21 out of 28 countries over the period 2010-2035, with trends attenuating in the high-incidence populations of Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Austria. Although population ageing would be expected to reduce the number of cases, this demographic effect is outweighed by increasing risk, leading to an overall increase in the number of cases by 2035 in Europe, and by region (21, 13 and 32% in Northern, Western and Eastern Europe, respectively). Declines are however predicted in Italy and Spain, amounting to 12% less cases in 2035 in Southern Europe overall. In conclusion, the burden of testicular cancer incidence in Europe will continue to increase, particularly in historically lower-risk countries. The largest increase in the number of testicular cancer patients is predicted in Eastern Europe, where survival is lower, reinforcing the need to ensure the provision of effective treatment across Europe.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO); licensed by UICC.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study sought to investigate whether the median frequency (MF) surface electromyographic (SEMG) back muscle fatigue method-a proxy for glycolytic muscle metabolism-would be able to detect age- and sex-specific differences in neuromuscular and muscle metabolic functions in individuals with cLBP in a reliable way, and whether it would be as sensitive as when used on healthy individuals. With participants seated on a dynamometer (20° trunk anteflexion), paraspinal SEMG activity was recorded bilaterally from the multifidus (L5), longissimus (L2), and iliolumbalis (L1) muscles during isometric, sustained back extensions loaded at 80% of maximum from 117 younger (58 females) and 112 older (56 female) cLBP individuals. Tests were repeated after 1-2 days and 6 weeks. Median frequency, the SEMG variable indicating neuromuscular fatigue, was analyzed. Maximum back extensor strength was comparable between younger and older participants. Significantly less MF-SEMG back muscle fatigue was observed in older as compared to younger, and in older female as compared to older male cLBP individuals. Relative reliability was excellent, but absolute reliability appeared large for this SEMG-fatigue measure. Findings suggest that cLBP likely does not mask the age-specific diagnostic potential of the MF-SEMG back extensor fatigue method. Thus, this method possesses a great potential to be further developed into a valuable biomarker capable of detecting back muscle function at risk of sarcopenia at very early stages.</AbstractText>"}

This has challenged the treatment of the disease in older aged patients, usually characterized by comorbid conditions and polypharmacy. Overall, the lung involvement in RA is present in up to 80% of patients, depending on the assessment tools used, and interstitial abnormalities are among the most common; when present, interstitial lung disease (ILD) worsens the prognosis of RA, and is the second most common cause of mortality. The aged lung undergoes functional and structural changes termed immunosenescence and inflammaging, which facilitate the occurrence of fibrosis of the lung. Therefore, ILD tends to occur more frequently in older patients with RA. The age at onset of RA distinguishes patients as having young-onset RA (YORA, &lt; 60 years) or late-onset RA (LORA, &gt; 60 years); the latter are characterized by more severe features of the disease and higher rates of lung involvement. The most frequent RA-related ILD radiological pattern is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP); this includes peripheral and basal predominant reticulation and honeycombing with or without associated traction bronchiectasis. Patients with the UIP pattern are usually older and have more rapid decline in lung function and a worse prognosis. Treatment with corticosteroids in elderly patients carries the risk of adverse effects, such as osteoporosis, infections, diabetes, peptic ulcers, and cataract. The use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is generally well-tolerated by the elderly. The current narrative review aims at elucidating the association between ILD and RA in older individuals.</AbstractText>"}

However, little research has been done on polyphenols other than resveratrol and there seem to be no studies on their influence on young and old cells. The purpose of this study was to analyse the potential effects of quercetin, caffeic acid, and resveratrol on young and old fibroblast cells in the expressions of different clock genes and aging-related genes, and further investigate the mechanism. The mRNA expression of different clock genes and aging-related genes was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The protein levels of clock genes (BMAL1, PER1 and SIRT1) and glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα) were assessed by ELISA. Quercetin and caffeic acid in old fibroblast cells showed higher clock gene expression than resveratrol, quercetin increased Sirt1 expression, and caffeic acid increased Sirt6 expression indicating the possibility of an anti-aging effect. Also, quercetin and caffeic acid showed higher clock-controlled gene (Sirt1 and NR1D1) expression than resveratrol in young fibroblast cells. It appears that caffeic acid acts on NRF2 expression, and in turn to the actions of GRα, GDF11, Sirt1, and Sirt6. Regarding the increased expression of Per1, the activation effect on NR1D1 was confirmed only for caffeic acid in young fibroblast cells.

It is not that the experimental science behind those claims is totally wrong or fake. But it is often a case of being ahistorical and ignoring the cumulated knowledge and understanding of the evolutionary and biological principles of ageing and longevity. Furthermore, remaining stuck to the body-as-a-machine viewpoint reduces ageing and its associated health challenges to a mere problem of engineering and design. However, highly dynamic nature of the living systems with properties of interaction, interdependence, tolerance, adaptation and constant remodelling requires wholistic and interactive modes of understanding and maintaining health. The physiological relevance and significance of progressively accumulating molecular damage remains to be fully understood. As for ageing interventions, the three pillars of health-food, physical activity, and social and mental engagement-which actually show health-promoting effect, cannot simply be reduced to a single or a limited number of molecular targets with hopes of creating an exercise pill, a fasting pill, a happiness pill and so on.

Whether or not this can be extended to pediatric populations is unclear. This systematic review assessed associations of sedentary behavior with large artery structure and function in pediatric populations. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched from the earliest available date to 31st of December 2018. Analyses of associations of sedentary behavior with large artery structure or function in a pediatric (sub-)population were included, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was published in advance on PROSPERO (CRD42018112996). Study quality and quality of evidence were analyzed using NHLBI Study Quality assessment tools and GRADE. Six observational studies found no association of exposure and outcome variables, and one had contradicting results. One intervention found reduced flow-mediated dilation after 3 h of uninterrupted sitting. Exposure and outcome measures were highly heterogeneous. Study quality was low to moderate. Quality of evidence was very low or low in the observational studies and high in the intervention.Conclusion: In pediatric populations, current evidence is limited and of low quality about how acute effects of sedentary behavior translate into early vascular aging and the long-term development of vascular dysfunction and atherosclerotic risk. Future studies should emphasize a careful choice of the adequate type and measurement site of a biomarker for large artery structure and function as well as conduct a detailed assessment of sedentary behavior patterns.Trial registration: PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42018112996What is known: • An independent association of sedentary behavior and biomarkers of large artery structure and function has been demonstrated in adults. • In children, sedentary behavior is directly associated with classical cardiovascular risk factors like elevated blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, obesity, and elevated blood lipids.What is new: • Currently, only few studies of low quality in children and adolescents provide limited evidence about how acute effects of sedentary behavior translate into early vascular aging and the long-term development of atherosclerosis. • The type and measurement site of vascular biomarker need to be chosen carefully, and a detailed assessment of sedentary behavior patterns is important to minimize the methodological bias.</AbstractText>"}

Given the diversity of plant viruses and their arthropod vectors, the effects for any specific system are not possible to predict. Here, we present experimental evidence that acquisition of maize Iranian mosaic virus (MIMV, genus Nucleorhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae) modifies the biological traits of its insect vector, the small brown planthopper (SBPH) Laodelphax striatellus. MIMV is an economically important virus of maize and several other grass species. It is transmitted by SBPHs in a persistent-propagative manner. We evaluated the effects of MIMV acquisition by SBPH on its life history when reared on healthy barley plants (Hordeum vulgare). We conclude that 1) MIMV acquisition by SBPHs increases female fecundity, duration of the nymph stage, adult longevity, and survival of SBPHs, (2) the mortality rate and female-to-male sex ratio are reduced in MIMV-infected planthoppers, and (3) MIMV infection increases the concentration of some biochemical components of the infected plants, including carbohydrates, some amino acids, and total protein, which might influence the life traits of its insect vector. The results indicate the potential of MIMV to improve the ecological fitness of its vector, SBPH, through direct or indirect effects, with the potential to increase the spread of the virus.</AbstractText>"}

Increasing life expectancy is behind the growing prevalence of AD worldwide with approximately 45 million cases currently documented and projection studies suggesting a triplication of this number by 2050. Mexico does not have an accurate AD registry, but 860,000 cases were reported in 2014 and the prediction reaches 3.5 million cases by 2050. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles represent the main hallmarks of AD, being constituted of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and phosphorylated tau, respectively. The risk factors for AD include genetic mutations, lifestyle and environmental pollution. Particularly, lead (Pb) has attracted attention due to its ability to target multiple pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Although the epidemiological data are limiting, animal and in vitro studies show growing evidence of causal effects of Pb exposure on AD-linked features including Aβ aggregation and tau phosphorylation. Interestingly, many Pb effects occur selectively following early-life exposure to the metal, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by changes in DNA methylation and microRNA expression patterns inflicted by early-life Pb exposure. Pb pollution in Mexico represents a significant problem because past and current mining activities, historical use of Pb as fuel additive and culturally rooted use of Pb in glazed ceramics, contribute to high levels of Pb pollution in Mexico. In this review we will discuss potential risks of AD development in Mexican populations chronically exposed to Pb in their childhood.</AbstractText>"}

This clinical test may be biased by the variability of the pull force applied. Our objective was to study the postural responses elicited by reproducible pull forces in healthy subjects and PD patients at different stages of the disease. We performed a multimodal approach that included a systematic analysis of the pull force needed to reach the backward limit of stability (FBLoS) assessed by mechanically produced forces, the displacements of the center of pressure (CoP) recorded on a force platform, and the latencies and patterns of activation of the stabilizing muscles. Comparisons between groups were performed by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Sixty-four healthy subjects and 32 PD patients, 22 Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stages I-II and 10 H-Y stage III, were studied. In healthy subjects, FBLoS decreased with aging and was lower in females. Mean (SD) FBLoS was 98.1 (48.9) Newtons (N) in healthy subjects, 70.5 (39.8) N in PD patients H-Y stages I-II, and 37.7 (18.9) N in PD patients H-Y stage III. Compared to healthy subjects and when adjusted for age and gender, PD patients H-Y stages I-II exhibited the following: (a) a reduced FBLoS; (b) larger CoP displacements and higher velocities for the same applied force; and (c) combined ankle and hip strategies elicited by less intense pull forces. All of these abnormalities were more pronounced in H-Y stage III PD patients compared to H-Y stages I-II PD patients. In conclusion, patients in the early stages of PD already exhibit a degree of postural instability due to inefficient postural adjustments, and they can more easily be destabilized by small perturbations than healthy subjects. This balance impairment becomes more pronounced in more advanced PD. In the pull test, pull force to step back should be a variable to consider when testing balance in clinical practice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Javier Ricardo Pérez-Sánchez and Francisco Grandas.</CopyrightInformation>"}

{"PMID":31772706,"Title":"Apocynin Dietary Supplementation Delays Mouse Ovarian Ageing.","Journal":"Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Advanced maternal age is associated with higher infertility rates, pregnancy-associated complications, and progeny health issues. The ovary is considered the main responsible for these consequences due to a continuous decay in follicle number and oocyte quality. Intracellular imbalance between oxidant molecules and antioxidant mechanisms, in favour of the former, results in oxidative stress (OS) that is believed to contribute to ovarian ageing. This work is aimed at evaluating whether an age-related increase in ovarian OS, inflammation, and fibrosis may contribute to tissue dysfunction and whether specific antioxidant supplementation with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) could ameliorate them. Mice aged 8-12 weeks (reproductively young) or 38-42 weeks (reproductively aged) were employed. Aged mice were divided into two groups, with one receiving apocynin (5 mM) in the drinking water, for 7 weeks, upon which animals were sacrificed and their ovaries collected. Ovarian structure was similar at both ages, but the ovaries from reproductively aged mice exhibited lipofuscin deposition, enhanced fibrosis, and a significant age-related reduction in primordial and primary follicle number when compared to younger animals. Protein carbonylation and nitration, and markers of OS were significantly increased with age. Moreover, mRNA levels of inflammation markers, collagens, metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitor MMPs (TIMPs) were upregulated. Expression of the antifibrotic miRNA29c-3p was significantly reduced. Apocynin supplementation ameliorated most of the age-related observed changes, sometimes to values similar to those observed in young females. These findings indicate that there is an age-related increase in OS that plays an important role in enhancing inflammation and collagen deposition, contributing to a decline in female fertility. Apocynin supplementation suggests that the imbalance can be ameliorated and thus delay ovarian ageing harmful effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 F.

The milk consumption variables were assessed with the NHANES Diet Behavior and Nutrition questionnaire. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to measure leukocyte telomere length. Results showed that milk consumption frequency was not related to telomere length; however, there was a strong association between milk fat intake and telomere length. With the sample delimited to milk drinkers only, milk fat intake was linearly and inversely related to telomere length, after adjusting for the covariates (<i>F</i> = 8.6, <i>P</i> = 0.0066). For each 1 percentage point increase in milk fat consumed (e.g., 1% to 2%), adults had more than 4 years of additional biological aging. With milk fat intake divided into 5 categories (i.e., milk abstainers, nonfat, 1%, 2%, and full-fat milk), mean telomere lengths differed across the categories (<i>F</i> = 4.1, <i>P</i> = 0.0093). The mean telomere difference between the extremes of milk fat intake (nonfat vs. full-fat) was 145 base pairs, representing years of additional biological aging for full-fat milk consumers. Effect modification testing indicated that the milk fat and cellular aging association may be partly due to saturated fat intake differences across the milk fat groups. When the sample was delimited to adults reporting only high total saturated fat intake (tertile 3), the milk fat and telomere relationship was strong. However, when the sample was restricted to adults reporting only low saturated fat consumption (tertile 1), there was no relationship between milk fat intake and telomere length. Overall, the findings highlight an association of increased biological aging in U.S. adults who consumed high-fat milk. The results support the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020), which recommend consumption of low-fat milk, but not high-fat milk, as part of a healthy diet.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Larry A.

In the last decade, the role of microbiota-host interactions in driving human cancer plasticity and malignant progression has been well documented. Germ-free preclinical models provided an invaluable tool to demonstrate that the human microbiota can confer susceptibility to various types of cancer and can also modulate the host response to therapeutic treatments. Of interest, besides the detrimental effects of dysbiosis on cancer etiopathogenesis, specific microorganisms have been shown to exert protective activities against cancer growth. This has strong clinical implications, as restoration of the physiologic microbiota is being rapidly implemented as a novel anticancer therapeutic strategy. Here, we reviewed past and recent literature depicting the role of microbiota-host interactions in modulating key molecular mechanisms that drive human cancer plasticity and lead to malignant progression. We analyzed microbiota-host interactions occurring in the gut as well as in other anatomic sites, such as oral and nasal cavities, lungs, breast, esophagus, stomach, reproductive tract, and skin. We revealed a common ground of biological alterations and pathways modulated by a dysbiotic microbiota and potentially involved in the control of cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms most frequently affected by the pathogenic microorganisms to induce malignant progression involve epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) dependent barrier alterations and tumor-promoting inflammation. This evidence may pave the way to better stratify high-risk cancer patients based on unique microenvironmental/microbial signatures and to develop novel, personalized, biological therapies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Daniele Vergara et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Our results show that the support of the microenvironment is partly dependent on CD84, a cell surface molecule belonging to the Signaling Lymphocyte Activating Molecule (SLAM) family of immunoreceptors. Our results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy whereby eliminating BMDCs or blocking the CD84 expressed on these cells may reduce the tumor load.</AbstractText>"}

Precipitation behaviour of the alloy aged at different temperatures were analysed with scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Selected-area diffraction patterns of the ω, ω/α and α phases in the alloy aged at different temperatures indicated that the type of phase transformation was influenced by the precipitation process. Precipitate-free zones in the alloy aged at 450 °C for 8 h were harmful to the mechanical performance. Fine α precipitates with an obvious texture were obtained in the alloy aged at 500 °C. A good combination of tensile properties with an ultimate tensile strength of 1310 MPa and an elongation of 13.5% were obtained due to the expected microstructure and texture of the precipitates that transformed in the specimen when it was aged at 500 °C for 8 h. The size of the precipitates increased with increasing aging temperature. Furthermore, the amount of precipitates and their degree of texture decreased substantially in the alloy aged at 600 °C. The investigation of the tensile properties and fractures also revealed a correlation between the mechanical properties and precipitation behaviour in the Ti-15Mo-2.7Nb-3Al-0.2Si alloy aged at different temperatures.</AbstractText>"}

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies, are lipid-bound vesicles secreted by cells into the circulation. EVs mediate intercellular communication by shuttling functional signaling molecules as cargo. EV characteristics by race in the context of mortality risk factors have not been described. We isolated plasma EVs from a cross-sectional cohort of African Americans (AA) and whites and found no significant differences in EV size, distribution or concentration between race or by sex. However, EV cargo showed increased levels of phospho-p53, total p53, cleaved caspase 3, ERK1/2 and phospho-AKT in white individuals compared to AAs. phospho-IGF-1R levels were significantly higher in females compared to males. EV concentration was significantly associated with several clinical mortality risk factors: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), alkaline phosphatase, body mass index, waist circumference and pulse pressure. The association of EV proteins with mortality markers were dependent on race. These data suggest that EV cargo can differ by race and sex and is associated with mortality risk factors.</AbstractText>"}

N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin) is a natural hormone secreted by the pineal gland which has been shown to participate in several physiological and pathological progresses, such as aging, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis and autophagy regulation. However, the effects of melatonin on IVD remain unclear. In the present study, we treated human nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) with melatonin and discovered that melatonin could modulate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling induced by IL-1β by enhancing collagen II and aggrecan expression levels and by downregulating matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) levels. These findings were verified by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Intraperitoneal injection of melatonin mitigated IVDD in the rat tail puncture model. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E), Safranine O-Green, Alcian blue and Celium red staining methods were adopted to evaluate IVDD grades, the structural integrity of nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) and the damage and calcification of the cartilage endplate. Melatonin reduced inflammatory cell aggregation and the release of the inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α as determined by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that melatonin could modulate ECM remodeling by IL-1β in vitro and attenuate the IVDD and induction of inflammation in a rat tail puncture model in vivo. The data demonstrated that melatonin may contribute to the restoration processs of IVD following damage and may be used as a potential novel therapy for IVDD.</AbstractText>"}

The production of PGE2 and HMGB1 was increased in the medium of the LPS-treated AFSCs. Certain inflammation-associated genes (<i>IL-β1</i>, <i>IL-6</i>, <i>COX-2</i> and <i>TNF-</i>α) and proteins (IL-β1, COX-2 and TNF-α) and specific catabolic genes (<i>MMP-3</i> and <i>MMP-13</i>) exhibited increased expression in LPS-treated AFSCs.

Following addition of metformin to LPS-containing medium, HMGB1 was retained in the nuclei of AFSCs and the production of PGE2 and HMGB1 was reduced. The expression levels of the catabolic genes and proteins were decreased and those of the anabolic genes were increased. The findings indicated that metformin exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by blocking the HMGB1 translocation and by inhibiting catabolic production and cell senescence in AFSCs.

GAS superantigens are key mediators of STSS through their potent activation of T cells leading to a cytokine storm and consequently vascular leakage, shock, and multiorgan failure. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells recognize MR1-presented antigens derived from microbial riboflavin biosynthesis and mount protective innate-like immune responses against the microbes producing such metabolites. GAS lack de novo riboflavin synthesis, and the role of MAIT cells in STSS has therefore so far been overlooked. Here we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of human MAIT cell responses to GAS, aiming to understand the contribution of MAIT cells to the pathogenesis of STSS. We show that MAIT cells are strongly activated and represent the major T cell source of IFNγ and TNF in the early stages of response to GAS. MAIT cell activation is biphasic with a rapid TCR Vβ2-specific, TNF-dominated response to superantigens and a later IL-12- and IL-18-dependent, IFNγ-dominated response to both bacterial cells and secreted factors. Depletion of MAIT cells from PBMC resulted in decreased total production of IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, and TNFβ. Peripheral blood MAIT cells in patients with STSS expressed elevated levels of the activation markers CD69, CD25, CD38, and HLA-DR during the acute compared with the convalescent phase. Our data demonstrate that MAIT cells are major contributors to the early cytokine response to GAS, and are therefore likely to contribute to the pathological cytokine storm underlying STSS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The metabolic adaptations required for resistance to hypoxia are hotly debated and a recent report provides evidence that they are able to switch from glucose to fructose driven glycolysis in the brain. However, other systemic alterations in their metabolism are largely unknown. In the current study, a semi-targeted high resolution <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) metabolomics investigation was performed on cardiac tissue from the naked mole-rat (NMR) and wild-type C57/BL6 mice to better understand these adaptations. A range of metabolic differences was observed in the NMR including increased lactate, consistent with enhanced rates of glycolysis previously reported, increased glutathione, suggesting increased resistance to oxidative stress and decreased succinate/fumarate ratio suggesting reduced oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production. Surprisingly, the most significant difference was an elevation of glycogen stores and glucose-1-phosphate resulting from glycogen turnover, that were completely absent in the mouse heart and above the levels found in the mouse liver. Thus, we identified a range of metabolic adaptations in the NMR heart that are relevant to their ability to survive extreme environmental pressures and metabolic stress. Our study underscores the plasticity of energetic pathways and the need for compensatory strategies to adapt in response to the physiological and pathological stress including ageing and ischaemic heart pathologies.</AbstractText>"}

Shoot branching is determined by two independent steps: axillary meristem formation and axillary bud outgrowth. Although several genes and regulatory mechanism have been studied with respect to shoot branching, the roles of chromatin-remodeling factors in the developmental process have not been reported in rice. We previously identified a chromatin-remodeling factor OsVIL2 that controls the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at target genes. In this study, we report that loss-of-function mutants in <i>OsVIL2</i> showed a phenotype of reduced tiller number in rice. The reduction was due to a defect in axillary bud (tiller) outgrowth rather than axillary meristem initiation. Analysis of the expression patterns of the tiller-related genes revealed that expression of <i>OsTB1</i>, which is a negative regulator of bud outgrowth, was increased in osvil2 mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsVIL2 binds to the promoter region of <i>OsTB1</i> chromatin in wild-type rice, but the binding was not observed in <i>osvil2</i> mutants. Tiller number of double mutant <i>osvil2 ostb1</i> was similar to that of <i>ostb1</i>, suggesting that <i>osvil2</i> is epistatic to <i>ostb1</i>.

Specifically, in this paper, we address the role of acyl chain composition in bodily fluids for monitoring obesity in males and females, in aging persons and in situations of environmental hypoxia adaptation. After a brief introduction on sphingolipid synthesis and compartmentalization, the node of detection methods has been critically revised as the node of the use of animal models. The latter do not recapitulate the human condition, making it difficult to compare levels of sphingolipids found in animal tissues and human bodily fluids, and thus, to find definitive conclusions. In human subjects, the search for putative biomarkers has to be performed on easily accessible material, such as serum. The serum 'sphingolipidome' profile indicates that attention should be focused on specific acyl chains associated with obesity, per se, since total Cer and SM levels coupled with dyslipidemia and vitamin D deficiency can be confounding factors. Furthermore, exposure to hypoxia indicates a relationship between dyslipidemia, obesity, oxygen level and aerobic/anaerobic metabolism, thus, opening new research avenues in the role of sphingolipids.</AbstractText>"}

In this research, we found that cytoplasmic restriction of SOD1G93A, which inhibited the nucleic translocation of SOD1WT, was directly related to increasing DNA damage in SOD1- mutated ALS disease. Our study showed that nucleic transport of DNA repair- processing proteins, such as p53, APEX1, HDAC1, and ALS- linked FUS were interfered with under increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the presence of SOD1G93A. During aging, the unsuccessful recognition and repair process of damaged DNA, due to the mislocalized DNA repair proteins might be closely associated with the enhanced susceptibility of DNA damage in SOD1- mutated neurons. In addition, the co-expression of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) directly interacting with SOD1 protein in neurons enhances the nucleic transport of cytoplasmic- restricted SOD1G93A.

Moreover, recent years have provided evidence that some drugs can selectively remove senescent cells. Therefore, it is essential to properly identify and characterize senescent cells, especially when it comes to cancer. Senescence was induced in various cancer cell lines (A549, SH-SY-5Y, HCT116, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7) following treatment with doxorubicin, irinotecan, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or paclitaxel. Treatment with tested chemotherapeutics resulted in upregulation of p21 and proliferation arrest without cytotoxicity. A comparative analysis with the use of common senescence markers (i.e., morphology, SA-β-galactosidase, granularity, secretory phenotype, and the level of double-stranded DNA damage) revealed a large diversity in response to the chemotherapeutics used. The strongest senescence inducers were doxorubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate; paclitaxel had an intermediate effect and oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil did not induce senescence. In addition, different susceptibility of cancer cells to senescence was observed. A statistical analysis aimed at finding any relationship between the senescence markers applied did not show clear correlations. Moreover, increased SA-β-gal activity coupled with p21 expression proved not to be an unequivocal senescence marker.

In this study, we quantify the temporal, high-frequency electroporation (HFE)-mediated BBBD in an in vivo healthy rat brain model. 40 male Fisher rats underwent HFE treatment; two blunt tipped monopolar electrodes were advanced into the brain and 200 bursts of HFE were delivered at a voltage-to-distance ratio of 600 V/cm. BBBD was verified with contrast enhanced T1W MRI (gadopentetate dimeglumine) and pathologically (Evans blue dye) at time points of 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after HFE. Contrast enhanced T1W scans demonstrated BBBD for 1 to 72 h after HFE but intact BBB at 96 h. Histologically, tissue damage was restricted to electrode insertion tracks. BBBD was induced with minimal muscle contractions and minimal cell death attributed to HFE. Numerical modeling indicated that brief BBBD was induced with low magnitude electric fields, and BBBD duration increased with field strength.

It provides structure, function, and protection for other vital organs; therefore, bone maintenance and homeostasis are critical processes. As humans age, their bone mineral density decreases, which leads to diseases like osteoporosis. This disease affects one in two women and one in five men aged 50 and over. As the aging population increases, the interest and significance of studying this debilitating bone disease becomes more relevant. Current therapeutic products for osteoporosis have many side effects and can be taken for a limited number of years. Most therapeutic products only focus on decreasing bone resorption, not increasing bone formation. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 is an essential growth factor that drives osteoblast differentiation and activity and is essential for bone formation. However, usage in the clinic is unsuccessful due to several side effects. Recently, a signaling disparity in bone marrow stromal cells within the bone morphogenetic protein pathway that led to decreased bone morphogenetic protein 2 responsiveness was identified in patients diagnosed with osteoporosis. However, it is unclear how other cell populations, especially osteoblasts, which are key players in bone remodeling, are affected and whether the bone morphogenetic protein pathway is affected during osteoporosis. Our research group designed a novel peptide, casein kinase 2.3, that acts downstream of the bone morphogenetic receptor type Ia and increases bone mineralization in murine cells and primary bovine osteoblasts. The aim of the study presented here was to compare the responsiveness of osteoblasts to bone morphogenetic protein 2 and casein kinase 2.3, especially in patients diagnosed with osteoporosis. Mature osteoblasts were extracted from patients diagnosed with osteoporosis or osteoarthritis from Christiana Care Hospital in Newark, Delaware. They were stimulated with either bone morphogenetic protein 2 or casein kinase 2.3, and their effect on osteoblast activity was determined. The osteoporotic patients showed no mineralization response to bone morphogenetic protein 2 stimulation, while the osteoarthritis patients significantly responded to bone morphogenetic protein 2 stimulation. Furthermore, markers for osteoblast activity were increased by casein kinase 2.3, which was in sharp contrast to bone morphogenetic protein 2. This further supports a major bone morphogenetic protein signaling disparity in both the elderly and those suffering with osteoporosis.

With the advancement of technology, the general population are now spending more hours craning our necks and slouching over smartphones, tablets and computers, et cetera. Bodily posture is representative of physical and mental health. Poor posture can lead to spinal complications and the same can be said vice versa. As the standard of living increases, there is an increase in consumerism and the expectation to maintain such a lifestyle even in the aging population. Therefore, many are able to afford small luxuries in life, such as a piece of technology that could potentially improve their health in the long run. Wearable technology is a promising alternative to laboratory systems for movement and posture analysis. This article reviews commercial wearable devices with a focus on postural analysis. The clinical applicability of posture wearables, particularly in preventing, monitoring and treating spinal and musculoskeletal conditions, along with other purposes in healthcare, will be discussed.</AbstractText>"}

The PAA solution was prepared by copolymerization of an aromatic dianhydride and an aromatic diamine mixture, including carborane-containing aromatic diamine in an aprotic solvent. The CPI films showed excellent thermo-oxidative stability at 700 °C due to the multilayered protection layers formed on the film surface by thermal conversion of the carborane group into boron oxides. The boron oxide layer enhanced the degradation activation energy and suppressed the direct contact of inner polymer materials with oxygen molecules in a high-temperature environment, acting as a 'self-healing' skin layer on the polyimide materials. The CPI-50 film was still flexible and maintained 50% retention of mechanical strength even after thermo-oxidative aging at 700 °C/5 min.

Pathologically misfolded and mislocalized Alz50 tau colocalized with iAβ and rapidly increased following a brief metabolic stress with glutamate. AβPP-CTF, Aβ45, and aggregated Aβ colocalized most strongly with mitochondria and endosomes and less with lysosomes and autophagosomes. Differences in iAβ by sex were minor. These results suggest that incomplete carboxyl-terminal trimming of long Aβs by gamma-secretase produced large intracellular deposits which limited completion of autophagy in aged neurons.

Carriage of BDNF Val66Met has been associated with faster cognitive decline and greater hippocampal atrophy in cognitively normal elderly. Thus, we examined the effects of the concurrent presence of APOE and BDNF polymorphisms on cognitive functions and brain morphometry in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. 107 aMCI patients (mean age = 72.2) were recruited from the Czech Brain Aging Study and, based on APOE and BDNF genes polymorphisms, were divided into four groups: ɛ4-BDNFVal/Val (n = 37), ɛ4-BDNFMet (n = 19), ɛ4+BDNFVal/Val (n = 35), and ɛ4+BDNFMet (n = 16). All patients underwent clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and complex neuropsychological battery. The combination of APOEɛ4+ and BDNF Met was associated with significantly worse memory performance in immediate and delayed recall compared to other polymorphism groups. We did not observe increased atrophy in areas related to memory function in the ɛ4+BDNFMet group. Our findings suggest that carriage of ɛ4+BDNFMet is associated with more pronounced memory dysfunction, a typical feature of early AD, but not with structural brain changes in aMCI patients.

E","Date":"Oct 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Relaxation of internal stresses through a cascade of microscopic restructuring events is the hallmark of many materials, ranging from amorphous solids like glasses and gels to geological structures subjected to a persistent external load. By means of photon correlation imaging, a recently developed technique that blends the powers of scattering and imaging, we provide a spatially and temporally resolved survey of the restructuring and aging processes that spontaneously occur in physical gels originating from an arrested phase separation. We show that the temporal dynamics is characterized by an intermittent sequence of spatially localized 'microquakes' that eventually lead to global rearrangements occurring at a rate that scales with the gel age. Notably, these dramatic upheavals of the gel structure are heralded by a progressive acceleration of the microscopic gel dynamics that originates from recognizable active spots and then spreads at a large but finite speed through the gel. Within the 'slack' phase between two of these 'macroquakes,' the fluctuations of the degree of temporal correlation obey a non-Gaussian statistics described by a generalized logistic distribution. The evidence we obtained bear consistent analogies with the stress relaxation processes taking place in earthquake sequences and with the intermittent restructuring of plastic crystals at the microscale.</AbstractText>"}

However, little is known about the effects of such aged MPs on the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in aqueous environments. To simulate the natural oxidation and UV-ageing process of MPs, three kinds of modified polyethylene MPs were obtained by plastic etching processes common in industry and UV irradiation, namely, etched MPs (EMPs), UV-aged MPs (UV-MPs), and etched MPs followed by UV ageing (UV-EMPs). The modified MPs showed a higher content of surface oxygen-containing groups than the pristine MPs, and the specific surface area and pore volume increased significantly after etching and ultraviolet ageing, especially for the EMPs (1.67 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.0049 cm³ g<sup>-1</sup>) and UV-EMPs (2.37 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.0089 cm³ g<sup>-1</sup>). The effect of modified MPs on the availability of 10 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, logK<sub>ow</sub> 4.18-6.20) was evaluated by negligible-depletion solid-phase microextraction (nd-SPME). The free concentrations (C<sub>free</sub>) of most PAHs (except for less hydrophobic PAHs, logK<sub>ow</sub> 4.18 and 4.56) decreased with an increasing concentration of MPs. The logarithms of the sorption coefficients of PAHs with various MPs (logK<sub>MPs</sub>, logK<sub>UV-MPs</sub>, logK<sub>EMPs</sub> and logK<sub>UV-EMPs</sub>) were linearly correlated with logK<sub>ow</sub>, suggesting that the sorption is hydrophobicity dependent. Compared with the results for pristine MPs (logK<sub>MP</sub> 3.80-4.95), UV ageing only slightly enhanced the sorption of PAHs by MPs (logK<sub>UV-MPs</sub> 3.71-4.98), whereas the plastic etching processes significantly enhanced sorption (logK<sub>EMPs</sub> 3.85-5.18 and logK<sub>UV-EMPs</sub> 3.90-5.28). The sorption of PAHs to MPs is mainly based on partitioning; however, a mechanism of adsorption also likely takes place in EMPs and UV-EMPs due to hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. Desorption study indicated that PAH desorption from MPs are dominated by film diffusion. However, intraparticle diffusion also takes great part for the EMPs. These results suggest that modification of MPs in the natural environment will change the availability of HOCs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, given the invasiveness of iEEG, investigations are constrained to patients with drug-resistant epilepsy for whom such recordings are clinically indicated. Particularly in the case of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), neuropathology and the possibility of functional reorganization are potential constraints on the generalizability of intra-cerebral findings and pose challenges to the development of therapies for memory disorders stemming from other etiologies. Here, samples of TLE (N ​= ​16; all of whom had undergone iEEG) and age-matched healthy control (N ​= ​19) participants underwent fMRI as they studied lists of concrete nouns. fMRI BOLD responses elicited by the study words were segregated according to subsequent performance on tests of delayed free recall and recognition memory. Subsequent memory effects predictive of both successful recall and recognition memory were evident in several neural regions, most prominently in the left inferior frontal gyrus, and did not demonstrate any group differences. Behaviorally, the groups did not differ in overall recall performance or in the strength of temporal contiguity effects. However, group differences in serial position effects and false alarm rates were evident during the free recall and recognition memory tasks, respectively. Despite these behavioral differences, neuropathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy was apparently insufficient to give rise to detectable differences in the functional neuroanatomy of episodic memory encoding relative to neurologically healthy controls. The findings provide reassurance that iEEG findings derived from experimental paradigms similar to those employed here generalize to the neurotypical population.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Two specific regions are singled out: the variable region of 2 kb that contains rearranged genes on the heavy, <i>κ</i> light, and <i>λ</i> light chain loci, and the switch region of ∼4 kb that contains an extensive stretch of G:C rich DNA on the heavy chain locus. Transcription is required for AID recruitment; however, many genes are also highly transcribed and do not undergo the catastrophic mutagenesis that occurs in variable and switch regions. The DNA sequences of these regions cause RNA polymerase II to accumulate for an extended distance of 2-4 kb. The stalled polymerases then recruit the transcription cofactor Spt5, and AID, which deaminates cytosines to uracils in exposed transcription bubbles. Thus, the immunoglobulin loci are unique in that a favorable combination of DNA sequences and 3' transcription enhancers make them the perfect storm for AID-induced somatic hypermutation.</AbstractText>"}

In various ex vivo and in vivo models, PPAR-γ-mediated signalling has recently surfaced as an essential element of hair follicle (HF) development, growth and stem cell biology. Moreover, the availability of novel, topically applicable PPAR-γ modulators with a favourable toxicological profile has extended the range of potential applications in clinical dermatology. In this review, we synthesize where this field currently stands and sketch promising future research avenues, focussing on the role of PPAR-γ-mediated signalling in the biology and pathology of human scalp HFs, with special emphasis on scarring alopecias such as lichen planopilaris and frontal fibrosing alopecia as model human epithelial stem cell diseases. In particular, we discuss whether and how pharmacological modulation of PPAR-γ signalling may be employed for the management of hair growth disorders, for example, in scarring alopecia (by reducing HF inflammation as well as by promoting the survival and suppressing pathological epithelial-mesenchymal transition of keratin 15 + epithelial stem cells in the bulge) and in hirsutism/hypertrichosis (by promoting catagen development). Moreover, we explore the potential role of PPAR-γ in androgenetic alopecia, HF energy metabolism and HF ageing, and consider clinical perspectives that emanate from the limited data available on this so far. As this field of translational human hair research is still in its infancy, many open questions exist, for which we briefly delineate selected experimental approaches that promise to generate instructive answers in the near future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

Via the in situ biostimulation of microbial processes, hexavalent U is reduced to less soluble tetravalent species, which are immobilized within the sediment. Although the mineral uraninite (UO<sub>2</sub>) was initially considered the dominant product of biological reduction, non-crystalline U(IV) species (NCU(IV)) are found to be abundant in the environment despite their greater susceptibility to oxidation and remobilization. However, it has been recently proposed that, through aging, NCU(IV) might transform into UO<sub>2</sub>, which would potentially enhance the stability of the reduced U pool. In this study, we performed column experiments to produce NCU(IV) species in natural sediment mimicking the environmental conditions during bioremediation. Bioreduced sediment retrieved from the columns and harboring NCU(IV) was incubated in static microcosms under anoxic conditions to allow the systematic monitoring of U coordination by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) over 12 months. XAS revealed that, under the investigated conditions, the speciation of U(IV) does not change over time. Thus, because NCU(IV) is the dominant species in the sediment, bioreduced U(IV) species remain vulnerable to oxidation and remobilization in the aqueous phase even after a 12-month aging period.</AbstractText>"}

In skin, environmental factors, for example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), can accelerate the effects of aging such as decline in barrier function and subsequent loss of hydration. Water homeostasis is vital for all cellular functions and it is known that organic osmolyte transport is critical to this process. Therefore, we hypothesized that as we age, these tightly controlled physiological mechanisms become disrupted, possibly due to loss of transporter expression. We investigated this in vivo, using human skin samples from photoprotected and photoexposed sites of young and aged volunteers. We show a reduction in keratinocyte cell size with age and a downregulation of osmolyte transporters SMIT and TAUT with both chronic and acute UVR exposure. Single-cell live imaging demonstrated that aged keratinocytes lack efficient cell volume recovery mechanisms possessed by young keratinocytes following physiological stress. However, addition of exogenous taurine significantly rescued cell volume; this was corroborated by a reduction in TAUT mRNA and protein in aged, as compared to young, keratinocytes. Collectively, these novel data demonstrate that human epidermal keratinocytes possess osmolyte-mediated cell volume regulatory mechanisms, which may be compromised in aging. Therefore, this suggests that organic osmolytes-especially taurine-play a critical role in cutaneous age-related xerosis and highlights a fundamental mechanism, vital to our understanding of the pathophysiology of skin aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In a discovery data set, we identified plasma ATX to be associated with parameters of systemic immune activation during chronic HCV and HCV/HIV infection. We and others have observed a partial normalization of ATX levels within months of starting interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) HCV therapy, consistent with a non-fibrotic liver disease contribution to elevated ATX levels, or HCV-mediated hepatocyte activation.

It is prevalent in older adults with cancer; age-associated physiologic muscle wasting and weakness, also known as sarcopenia, can compound deficits associated with cancer cachexia in older adults and makes studying this condition more complex in this population. Multiple measurement options are available to assess the older patient with cancer and cachexia and/or sarcopenia including anthropometric measures, imaging modalities such as Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and Computed Tomography (CT), muscular strength and physical performance testing, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). A geriatric assessment (GA) is a useful tool when studying the older patient with cachexia given its comprehensive ability to capture aging-sensitive PROs. Interventions focused on nutrition and increasing physical activity may improve outcomes in older adults with cachexia. Efforts to develop targeted pharmacologic therapies with cachexia have not been successful thus far. Formal treatment guidelines, an updated consensus definition for cancer cachexia and the development of a widely adapted assessment tool, much like the GA utilized in geriatric oncology, could help advance the field of cancer cachexia over the next decade.</AbstractText>"}

Healthy aging relates to changes in affective processing, but older adults' regulation of positive affect is less well understood than regulation of negative affect. We examined the cognitive reappraisal of positive and negative affect in healthy younger and older adults, and the neural correlates of reappraisal among older adults.<b>Method:</b> Participants viewed negative, positive, and neutral IAPS images and were instructed to attend or reappraise their affective response. Younger and older adults (<i>N</i> = 31) in the behavioral pilot were asked to report on their affect after each image. Another group of older adults (<i>N</i> = 19) completed the same task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.<b>Results:</b> Behaviorally, older adults were less effective than young adults at downregulating negative and positive affect. Older adults showed engagement of cognitive control regions when regulating negative affect, but not positive affect. Older adults showed increased, rather than decreased, activation in emotion appraisal regions when reappraising negative affect.<b>Discussion:</b> These results may suggest that older adults are less engaged with negative stimuli ; however, future work is needed to address several limitations such as a limited sample size. In addition, we recommend future researchers expand on this work examining regulation of both positive and negative affect among older adults.</AbstractText>"}

The hormone increases calcium and phosphate plasma concentrations in part by stimulation of intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of calcium and phosphate. It is primarily, but not exclusively, produced in the kidney. Renal 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> formation is stimulated by calcium and phosphate deficiency and by parathyroid hormone which is up-regulated by hypocalcemia. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> formation is inhibited by fibroblast growth factor FGF23, which is up-regulated by phosphate excess and requires Klotho to become effective. Klotho- or FGF23-deficiency leads to excessive plasma 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphate-concentrations with severe soft tissue calcification and accelerated aging. Tissue calcification and premature aging are prevented by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl without affecting 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-formation. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has powerful effects apparently unrelated to mineral metabolism, including anti-inflammatory actions and modification of multiple brain functions. Excessive 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> formation in klotho-deficient NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-treated mice leads to an amazing surge of exploratory behavior, lack of anxiety and decreased depression, effects dissipated by low vitamin D diet. Conversely, vitamin D deficient mice display reduced explorative behavior, enhanced anxiety, aberrant grooming, submissive social behavior, social neglect and maternal cannibalism. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is generated in human brain, and acts on diverse structures including prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra. In neurons 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> suppresses oxidative stress, inhibits inflammation, provides neuroprotection, down-regulates a variety of inflammatory mediators and up-regulates a wide variety of neurotrophins. Diseases postulated to be favorably modified by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> include multiple sclerosis, Parkinson´s disease, Alzheimer´s disease, depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Clearly, substantial additional experimentation is required to fully understand the neuro-psycho-pathophysiological role of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and to exploit 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or related agonists in the treatment of neuro-psychiatric disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© Copyright by the Author(s).

Based on data from the fifth wave of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (n = 64,840), we first look at the contribution of each capital in the use of three healthcare services (general practitioner, dentist and hospital). Using cluster analysis, we then mobilise Bourdieu's concept of habitus to explain how the unequal distribution of material and non-material capitals acquired in childhood lead to different levels of health and hospital care utilisation in later life. After controlling for demographic and health insurance variables, our results show that economic capital has the strongest individual association among the three capitals. However, the results of a cluster analysis used to distinguish between capital structures show that those with high non-material capital and low material capital have higher levels of primary healthcare utilisation, and in turn lower levels of hospital use. Bourdieu's approach sheds light on the importance of capitals in all forms and structures to understand the class-related mechanisms that contribute to different levels of healthcare use.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Both obesity and aging are independently known to be associated with cardiac dysfunction. However, in obese insulin-resistant subjects, the effects of aging on metabolic status and cardiac and mitochondrial functions are not completely understood. We hypothesized that in the obese insulin-resistant condition, aging induced by D-galactose increases cardiac senescence markers and aggravates the impairment of metabolic parameters, cardiac and mitochondrial function, and increases oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Sixty-four male Wistar rats were fed with either normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Then, rats were divided into vehicle groups (0.9% NSS, subcutaneous injection (SC)) or D-galactose groups (150 mg/kg/day, SC). After 0.9%NSS or D-galactose treatment for 4 weeks and 8 weeks, metabolic and cardiac functions were determined. The heart was then removed to determine mitochondrial functions and enable biochemical studies. After 4 weeks of D-galactose injection, ND rats treated with D-galactose (NDD4), HFD rats treated with vehicle (HFV4), and HFD rats treated with D-galactose (HFD4) had reduced cardiac function, impaired cardiac mitochondrial function and autophagy, and increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Interestingly, after 8 weeks, HFD rats treated with D-galactose (HFD8) had the worst impairment of cardiac and mitochondrial function, autophagy, and apoptosis in comparison to the other groups. Aging induced by D-galactose aggravated cardiac dysfunction in obese insulin-resistant rats through the worsening of cardiac mitochondrial function, autophagy, and increased apoptosis in a time-dependent manner.</AbstractText>"}

Hence, the aims of the present register-based cohort study were to examine possible urban-rural differences in short- and long-term mortality in Norwegian hip fracture patients and their potential associations with sociodemographic variables, and to investigate possible urban-rural differences in excess mortality in hip fracture patients compared with the general population. Data were provided from the NOREPOS hip fracture database, the 2001 Population and Housing Census, and the National Registry. The urbanization degree in each municipality was determined by the proportion of inhabitants living in densely populated areas (rural: &lt;1/3, semirural: 1/3 to 2/3, and urban: &gt;2/3). Age-adjusted mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated for hip fracture patients living in rural, semirural, and urban municipalities. A flexible parametric model was used to estimate age-adjusted average and time-varying HRs by category of urbanization with the rural category as reference. Among 96,693 hip fracture patients, urban residents had higher mortality than their rural-dwelling counterparts. The HR of mortality in urban compared with rural areas peaked during the first 1 to 2 years postfracture with a maximum HR of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.30) in men and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.21) in women. The differences were significant during approximately 5 years after fracture. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables did not substantially change the results. However, absolute 30-day mortality was not significantly different between urban and rural residents, suggesting that health-care quality immediately postfracture does not vary by urbanization. The novel findings of a higher long-term mortality in urban hip fracture patients might reflect disparities in health status or lifestyle, differences in posthip fracture health care or rehabilitation, or a combination of several factors. © 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

It also reviews the complex relationships among atrial myopathy, atrial fibrillation (AF), and stroke. Finally, it discusses how to apply the concept of atrial myopathy in the clinical setting-to identify patients with atrial myopathy and to be more selective in anticoagulation in a subset of patients with AF. An apparent lack of a temporal relationship between episodes of paroxysmal AF and stroke in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices has led investigators to search for additional factors that are responsible for AF-related strokes. Multiple animal models and human studies have revealed a close interplay of atrial myopathy, AF, and stroke via various mechanisms (e.g., aging, inflammation, oxidative stress, and stretch), which, in turn, lead to fibrosis, electrical and autonomic remodeling, and a pro-thrombotic state. The complex interplay among these mechanisms creates a vicious cycle of ever-worsening atrial myopathy and a higher risk of more sustained AF and strokes. By highlighting the importance of atrial myopathy and the risk of strokes independent of AF, this paper reviews the methods to identify patients with atrial myopathy and proposes a way to incorporate the concept of atrial myopathy to guide anticoagulation in patients with AF.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The Child-Pugh classification (CP) is used worldwide as an assessment tool for hepatic reserve function, even though it has some weaknesses. Recently, the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, calculated based on only albumin and total bilirubin, was proposed, and recent investigations have suggested that ALBI grade instead of CP can be used as an assessment tool for hepatic function as part of therapeutic strategies such as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging and a practical guideline presented by the Japan Society of Hepatology as well for total staging scoring systems. There has been an increasing number of reports showing that it has better capability than CP for HCC patients who undergo not only curative but also palliative treatments. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a major palliative treatment used for unresectable HCC, and the idea of TACE-refractory status has been proposed to indicate the possibility of switching to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). However, TKI administration requires a maintained hepatic reserve function, thus the importance of assessment of hepatic function in patients undergoing TACE treatments has increased. We consider that ALBI grade might also play a significant role as part of a detailed assessment of relative changes in hepatic function during treatment.

However, the large variety of commercial products and synthesis routes, make impossible to include all of them under the general term of 'monolithic zirconia ceramics'. Ultra- or high translucent monolithic formulations contain 3-8 mol% yttria, which results in materials with completely different structure, optical and mechanical properties. The purpose of this study was to provide an update to the current knowledge concerning monolithic zirconia and to review factors related to strength and aging resistance. Factors such as composition, coloring procedures, sintering method and temperature, may affect both strength and aging resistance to a more or less extend. A significant reduction of mechanical properties has been correlated to high translucent zirconia formualtions while regarding aging resistance, the findings are contradictory, necessitating more and thorough investigation. Despite the obvious advantages of contemporary monolithic zirconia ceramics, further scientific evidence is required that will eventually lead to the appropriate laboratory and clinical guidelines for their use. Until then, a safe suggestion should be to utilize high-strength partially-stabilized zirconia for posterior or long span restorations and fully-stabilized ultra-translucent zirconia for anterior single crowns and short span fixed partial dentures.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We observed a significant excess of rare protein-truncating variants among ALS cases, and these variants were concentrated in constrained genes. Through gene level analyses, we replicated known ALS genes including SOD1, NEK1 and FUS. We also observed multiple distinct protein-truncating variants in a highly constrained gene, DNAJC7. The signal in DNAJC7 exceeded genome-wide significance, and immunoblotting assays showed depletion of DNAJC7 protein in fibroblasts in a patient with ALS carrying the p.Arg156Ter variant. DNAJC7 encodes a member of the heat-shock protein family, HSP40, which, along with HSP70 proteins, facilitates protein homeostasis, including folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and clearance of degraded proteins. When these processes are not regulated, misfolding and accumulation of aberrant proteins can occur and lead to protein aggregation, which is a pathological hallmark of neurodegeneration. Our results highlight DNAJC7 as a novel gene for ALS.</AbstractText>"}

Both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to influence individual differences in the use of these substances. In the present study we tested whether genetic factors, modelled alongside common family environment, explained phenotypic variance in alcohol use and smoking behaviour in the Generation Scotland (GS) family sample of up to 19,377 individuals. SNP and pedigree-associated effects combined explained between 18 and 41% of the variance in substance use. Shared couple effects explained a significant amount of variance across all substance use traits, particularly alcohol intake, for which 38% of the phenotypic variance was explained. We tested whether the within-couple substance use associations were due to assortative mating by testing the association between partner polygenic risk scores in 34,987 couple pairs from the UK Biobank (UKB). No significant association between partner polygenic risk scores were observed. Associations between an individual's alcohol PRS (b = 0.05, S.E. = 0.006, p &lt; 2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>) and smoking status PRS (b = 0.05, S.E. = 0.005, p &lt; 2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>) were found with their partner's phenotype. In support of this, G carriers of a functional ADH1B polymorphism (rs1229984), known to be associated with greater alcohol intake, were found to consume less alcohol if they had a partner who carried an A allele at this SNP. Together these results show that the shared couple environment contributes significantly to patterns of substance use. It is unclear whether this is due to shared environmental factors, assortative mating, or indirect genetic effects. Future studies would benefit from longitudinal data and larger sample sizes to assess this further.</AbstractText>"}

Accumulating evidence has indicated that CircRNAs participated in modulating tumorigenesis by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA). However, the roles and functions of CircRNAs in cellular senescence and aging of organisms remain largely obscure. We performed whole transcriptome sequencing to compare the expression patterns of circular RNAs in young and prematurely senescent human diploid fibroblast 2BS cells, and identified senescence-associated circRNAs (SAC-RNAs). Among these SAC-RNAs, we observed the significantly downregulated expression of CircRNAs originating from exons 6 and 7 circularization of the cyclin B1 gene (<i>CCNB1</i>), termed CircCCNB1. Reduced CircCCNB1 expression triggered senescence in young 2BS cells, as measured by increased senescence associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, enhanced expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A)/P21 and tumor protein 53 (TP53) expression, and reduced cell proliferation. Mechanistically, reduced CircCCNB1 level inhibited cyclin E2 (CCNE2) expression by modulating micro RNA (miR)-449a activity, which repressed cellular proliferation. Our data suggested that CircCCNB1may serve as a sponge against miR-449a to delay cellular senescence by targeting CCNE2. Targeting CircCCNB1 may represent a promising strategy for aging and age-related disease interventions. Furthermore, we also identified and characterized several kinds of the CircCCNB1-binding proteins (CBPs), which may contribute to the degradation of CircCCNB1.</AbstractText>"}

A new generation of polymeric precursors was first synthesized for hybrid organic/inorganic silica aerogels from an epoxide ring containing a silica precursor. Ring opening polymerization (ROP) was used so as to insert flexible ether groups into the main chain. It has been demonstrated that the particulate structure of the polyether-based silica aerogel could be changed to a novel non-particulate and continuous one, by meticulous control of the thermodynamics, namely, through variations of the molecular weight of the polymeric precursor, the amount of the non-solvent, and the temperature. The study presents a new strategy to manufacture a polyether-based hybrid silica aerogel, which is fast and scalable, and also eliminates the aging process while accelerating the gelation time. This new strategy reduces the wet gel preparation time, including gelation, aging and solvent exchange, from several days to just a few seconds. However, this structure suffers from a low void fraction and wide pore size distribution. These drawbacks are then removed by chemically incorporating pre-polymerized vinyl trimethoxysilane chains. The resultant aerogels exhibit thermal superinsulation (λ = 15.9 mW·m<sup>-1</sup>·K<sup>-1</sup>) while providing good mechanical properties and flexibility. The polyether-based aerogels also demonstrated good performance as adsorbent material to remove organic solvents from water.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Telomere length was shortened in workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and influenced by individual genetic variations in telomere-binding proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can affect the progress of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription; however, whether polymorphisms in miRNA can act on the telomere length is still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to explore the relationships between telomere damage and genetic polymorphisms in miRNA or environmental exposure. A total of 544 coke oven workers and 238 healthy controls were recruited. After collecting peripheral blood and extracting the genomic DNA of the study subjects, the telomere length (TL) in their leucocytes was detected by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and polymorphisms in miRNAs were genotyped using the flight mass spectrometry technique. The concentrations of the four urine OH-PAHs were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the Soxhlet extraction method was used to detect the concentration of coke oven emissions (COEs) in the air. We found that the peripheral blood leucocyte DNA TL was significantly shorter in the exposure group (0.75; 0.51, 1.08) than that in the control group (1.05; 0.76, 1.44) (Z = 7.692, P &lt; 0.001).

Model validation demonstrates the model is capable of reproducing meteorological variables and major aerosol components, and the model significantly improves SOA and organic aerosol (OA) simulations by taking S/IVOCs (SVOC + IVOC) and relevant aging processes into account. SVOC and IVOC emissions in the BTH region are estimated to be 0.47 Tg and in a range of 0.09-0.36 Tg, respectively, which are about 18% and 4-14% of the emission amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The distribution of mean organic aerosols is characterized by a high concentration belt oriented southwest-northeast from southern Hebei to Beijing, with the maximum concentration up to 50 μg m<sup>-3</sup> in Beijing and Shijiazhuang. The simulated SOA concentration is comparable in magnitude to primary organic aerosol (POA) concentration, and the SOA/OA ratio is around 50% in most areas of the BTH region. In terms of domain average, the percentage contributions to SOA mass concentration from anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs), SVOCs, IVOCs and biogenic VOCs are estimated to be 46.1%, 40.1%, 9.4% and 4.4%, respectively, in the BTH region during the study period, which indicates an important role of S/IVOCs in SOA formation. From clean to haze periods, both POA and SOA concentrations apparently increase, with an increasing (decreasing) trend of the SOA/OA (POA/OA) ratio. SOA dominates over POA in fine organic aerosols during the haze periods. The increase of POA in hazy days is mainly due to the weakened vertical diffusion and accumulation near the surface, whereas the increase of SOA is likely attributed to both the reduced diffusivity and a series of competing chemical processes, in which the decreased photolysis rate by aerosol attenuation tends to decrease SOA concentration by about 6% during the most severe haze day, whereas the lower surface air temperature and higher POA and S/IVOC concentrations in haze days both enhance gas to particle partition, and consequently lead to higher SOA concentration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is evidence about the inefficient use of memory strategies in old adults. However, a question remains unresolved: Worse performance on memory test in the older people is due to an inability to mobilize cognitive strategies or to an episodic memory deficit? In this study we tried to answer it by using the Test of Memory Strategies (TMS), which parametrically reduces the need of executive functions on memory tests. The test consists of five experimental conditions (TMS1-5) where a progressive external organization of the material reduces the need to mobilize memory strategies. TMS was applied to a sample of 180 participants (n = 180) divided into three age groups (25-45; 46-65; 66-85). The results showed an increased performance in all groups groups (F(2, 177) = 14.79, p &lt; .001) across conditions (F(3.88,674.04) = 292.48, p &lt; .001), without group differences in those conditions with a maximum reduction of the need of executive functions (F(7.61,674.04) = 1.95, p = .053). However, middle age and older adults showed more difficulties in establishing cognitive strategies, in the initial conditions. These results lead to the conclusion that the typical pattern of low performance on episodic memory tasks in the older population may be due to the deterioration of executive functions and not mainly to a primary decline of memory process.</AbstractText>"}

We also highlight important ethical issues in forensic age determination and predicting the trajectory of biological aging in an individual.</AbstractText>"}

Certain natural bioactive compounds have the ability to regulate oxidative phosphorylation, the production of reactive oxygen species and the expression of mitochondrial proteins; but their efficacy within the mitochondrial physiopathology of cardiovascular diseases has not been clarified yet. The following review has the purpose of evaluating several natural compounds with evidence of mitochondrial effect in cardiovascular disease models, ascertaining the main cellular mechanisms and their potential use as functional foods for prevention of cardiovascular disease and healthy aging.</AbstractText>"}

As such, honey bees were inoculated with fresh purified spores of this pathogen, both individually (Group A) or collectively (Group B) and they were studied from 0 to 15 days post-emergence (p.e.) to evaluate the effect of bee age and the method of inoculation at 7 days post-infection. The level of infection was analyzed individually by qPCR by measuring the relative amount of the <i>N. ceranae</i><i>polar tubule protein 3</i> (<i>PTP3)</i> gene. The results show that the bee's age and the method of infection directly influence parasite load, and thus, early disease development. Significant differences were found regarding bee age at the time of infection, whereby the youngest bees (new-born and 1 day p.e.) developed the highest parasite load, with this load decreasing dramatically in bees infected at 2 days p.e. before increasing again in bees infected at 3-4 days p.e. The parasite load in bees infected when older than 4 days p.e. diminished as they aged. When the age cohort data was pooled and grouped according to the method of infection, a significantly higher mean concentration and lower variation in <i>N. ceranae</i> infection was evident in Group A, indicating greater variation in experimental infection when spores were administered collectively to bees through their food. In summary, these data indicate that both biological and experimental factors should be taken into consideration when comparing data published in the literature.</AbstractText>"}

Nutrition care process related activities such as screening, assessment and treatment has been advocated by scientific societies and patient organizations but implementation is variable. We analysed the cross-sectional nutritionDay database for prevalence of nutrition risk factors, care processes and outcome for medical, surgical, long-term care and other patients (<i>n =</i> 153,470). In 59,126 medical patients included between 2006 and 2015 the prevalence of recent weight loss (45%), history of decreased eating (48%) and low actual eating (53%) was more prevalent than low BMI (8%). Each of these risk factors was associated with a large increase in 30 days hospital mortality. A similar pattern is found in all four patient groups. Nutrition care processes increase slightly with the presence of risk factors but are never done in more than 50% of the patients. Only a third of patients not eating in hospital receive oral nutritional supplements or artificial nutrition. We suggest that political action should be taken to raise awareness and formal education on all aspects related to DRM for all stakeholders, to create and support responsibilities within hospitals, and to create adequate reimbursement schemes. Collection of routine and benchmarking data is crucial to tackle DRM.</AbstractText>"}

Vitamin D regulates and modulates the physiology and function of multiple human systems, including the skeletal muscle. The effect of vitamin D on the muscle has been widely investigated, suggesting that this hormone can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle fibers, maintaining and improving muscle strength and physical performance. Older persons have a higher prevalence of low Vitamin D levels as a consequence of low dietary intake and reduced ultraviolet irradiation of the skin. Therefore, older people with vitamin D deficiency might be at risk of sarcopenia, a geriatric syndrome characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength often complicated by adverse events, such as falls, disability hospitalization and death. Several randomized clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation in older patients to prevent or treat sarcopenia, but results are still controversial. In this narrative review we summarize the biological, clinical and epidemiological evidence supporting the hypothesis of a causal association between Vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of sarcopenia in older people.</AbstractText>"}

The resulting hormonal imbalances lead to increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens levels, at the expense of decreased concentrations of glucocorticoids and, in some cases, of mineralocorticoids. A variety of clinical presentations accompany a range of severities, which are described as different forms of CAH, and are the result of these hormonal imbalances. The incidence of CAH worldwide is approximately 1 in 15,000 live births, and is population-dependent; thus, its inclusion in neonatal screening tests is widely discussed. Diagnosis of CAH is based on the quantiﬁcation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, usually by immunoassay, which has low speciﬁcity and high false-positive rates, resulting in a relatively high demand for a second-tier conﬁrmation test. We report a case of a newborn recognized as female at birth, but showing ambiguous genitalia and other CAH clinical features, including hypernatremia, in the first days of life. In addition to the classical assays, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the serum steroid profile, allowing for the accurate and simultaneous quantification of seven steroids in the same analysis. Such an application immediately revealed an alteration in the levels of specific steroids related to CAH, leading to an early intervention by hormone replacement therapy. Subsequently, the diagnosis of classic CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deﬁciency was further confirmed by molecular testing.</AbstractText>"}

Yet, less is known about how neighborhoods experiencing change influence the ability to age in place. One type of rapid neighborhood change occurring across major cities nationally and globally is gentrification, a process whereby the culture of an existing neighborhood changes through the influx of more affluent residents and businesses. Few studies have considered the impact of gentrification on older adults, who are among the most vulnerable to economic and social pressures that often accompany gentrification. The current study explores one consequence of gentrification, indirect displacement. While gentrification-induced displacement can refer to the physical (e.g., direct) displacement of residents moving out of a neighborhood due to rising housing costs, it also references the replacement of the unique character and social identity of a neighborhood (e.g., indirect displacement). We examine perceptions of the latter, characterized by perceived cultural shifts and housing concerns among adults aging in place in a gentrifying neighborhood in New York City. The implications of indirect displacement for displacement risk and aging precarity are discussed as potential threats to aging in place in age-friendly cities.</AbstractText>"}

MA, MB, and tricin were purified from rice husk by column chromatography and their biological activities were subsequently assayed by in vitro trials. The contents of MA, MB, and tricin of different commercial rice cultivars in Japan were quantified and confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. The antioxidant assays revealed a synergistic activity of the mixture MA and MB (MAB, 1:1, <i>v/v</i>). In addition, in 2,2'-azino-bis (ABTS) assay, IC<sub>50</sub> values of MAB (0.3 mg/mL) and tricin (0.3 mg/mL) was 4-fold and 9-fold greater than that of individual MB (1.3 mg/mL) or MA (2.8 mg/mL), respectively. The in vitro enzymatic assays on pancreatic elastase and tyrosinase indicated that MA and MB were potential to relief skin wrinkles and freckles. In detail, MA exerted higher inhibition on both enzymatic activities (30.9 and 37.6% for elastase and tyrosinase inhibition, respectively) than MB (18.5 and 12.6%) and MAB (32.0 and 19.7%) at a concentration of 2.0 mg/mL.

Redox homeostasis is crucial for dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) differentiation and mineralized matrix deposition, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was found to be involved not only in immunomodulation but also in cell proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, we evaluated molecular pathways underlying the intracellular balance between redox homeostasis and extracellular matrix mineralization of DPSCs in the presence of composite scaffolds made of alginate and nano-hydroxyapatite (Alg/HAp). Prostaglandin-2 (PGE2) and IL-6 secretion was monitored by ELISA assays, and protein expression levels were quantified by Western blotting. This work aims to demonstrate a relationship between DPSC capacity to secrete a mineralized matrix in the presence of Alg/HAp scaffolds and their immunomodulatory properties. The variation of the molecular axis Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)/PGE2/IL-6 suggests a tight intracellular balance between oxidative stress responses and DPSC differentiation in the presence of Alg/HAp scaffolds.</AbstractText>"}

Recent studies detected genomic aberrations affecting <i>JAK</i> and <i>STAT</i> genes in T-PLL. Due to the limited number of primary patient samples available, genomic analyses of the JAK/STAT pathway have been performed in rather small cohorts. Therefore, we conducted-via a primary-data based pipeline-a meta-analysis that re-evaluated the genomic landscape of T-PLL. It included all available data sets with sequence information on <i>JAK</i> or <i>STAT</i> gene loci in 275 T-PLL. We eliminated overlapping cases and determined a cumulative rate of 62.1% of cases with mutated <i>JAK</i> or <i>STAT</i> genes. Most frequently, <i>JAK1</i> (6.3%), <i>JAK3</i> (36.4%), and <i>STAT5</i><i>B</i> (18.8%) carried somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), with missense mutations in the SH2 or pseudokinase domains as most prevalent. Importantly, these lesions were predominantly subclonal. We did not detect any strong association between mutations of a <i>JAK</i> or <i>STAT</i> gene with clinical characteristics. Irrespective of the presence of gain-of-function (GOF) SNVs, basal phosphorylation of STAT5B was elevated in all analyzed T-PLL. Fittingly, a significant proportion of genes encoding for potential negative regulators of STAT5B showed genomic losses (in 71.4% of T-PLL in total, in 68.4% of T-PLL without any <i>JAK</i> or <i>STAT</i> mutations). They included <i>DUSP4, CD45, TCPTP, SHP1, SOCS1, SOCS3</i><i>,</i> and <i>HDAC9</i>. Overall, considering such losses of negative regulators and the GOF mutations in <i>JAK</i> and <i>STAT</i> genes, a total of 89.8% of T-PLL revealed a genomic aberration potentially explaining enhanced STAT5B activity. In essence, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis on the highly prevalent genomic lesions that affect genes encoding JAK/STAT signaling components. This provides an overview of possible modes of activation of this pathway in a large cohort of T-PLL. In light of new advances in JAK/STAT inhibitor development, we also outline translational contexts for harnessing active JAK/STAT signaling, which has emerged as a 'secondary' hallmark of T-PLL.</AbstractText>"}

Knockdown (KD) of KDM4C suppressed cell proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity in PCa cells as well as reduced tumor growth of human PCa cells in zebrafish xenotransplantation assay. Micro-Western array (MWA) analysis indicated that KD of KDM4C protein decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, c-Myc, AR, mTOR, PDK1, phospho-PDK1 S241, KDM8, and proteins involved in cell cycle regulators, while it increased the expression of PTEN. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that KDM4C co-localized with AR and c-Myc in the nuclei of PCa cells. Overexpression of either AKT or c-Myc rescued the suppressive effect of KDM4C KD on PCa cell proliferation. Echoing the above findings, the mRNA and protein expression of KDM4C was higher in human prostate tumor tissues as compared to adjacent normal prostate tissues, and higher KDM4C protein expression in prostate tumors correlated to higher protein expression level of AKT and c-Myc. In conclusion, KDM4C promotes the proliferation of PCa cells via activation of c-Myc and AKT.</AbstractText>"}

However, the genes and gene variants that influence its plasma levels are still not well known. Results of studies investigating polymorphisms in candidate genes have been inconsistent, and, in addition, very few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been undertaken. Our aim was to investigate the genes and gene variants most associated with plasma leptin concentrations in a high-cardiovascular-risk Mediterranean population. We measured plasma leptin in 1011 men and women, and analyzed the genetic factors associated using three approaches: (1) Analyzing the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in a GWAS meta-analysis in other populations (including an SNP in/near each of these LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL, COBLL1, and FTO genes); (2) Investigating additional SNPs in/near those genes, also including the RLEP gene; and (3) Undertaking a GWAS to discover new genes. We did not find any statistically significant associations between the previously published SNPs and plasma leptin (Ln) in the whole population adjusting for sex and age. However, on undertaking an extensive screening of other gene variants in those genes to capture a more complete set of SNPs, we found more associations. Outstanding among the findings was the heterogeneity per sex. We detected several statistically significant interaction terms with sex for these SNPs in the candidate genes. The gene most associated with plasma leptin levels was the FTO gene in men (specifically the rs1075440 SNP) and the LEPR in women (specifically the rs12145690 SNP). In the GWAS on the whole population, we found several new associations at the <i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> level, among them with the rs245908-CHN2 SNP (<i>p</i> = 1.6 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). We also detected a SNP*sex interaction at the GWAS significance level (<i>p</i> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), involving the SLIT3 gene, a gene regulated by estrogens. In conclusion, our study shows that the SNPs selected as relevant for plasma leptin levels in other populations, are not good markers for this Mediterranean population, so supporting those studies claiming a bias when generalizing GWAS results to different populations. These population-specific differences may include not only genetic characteristics, but also age, health status, and the influence of other environmental variables. In addition, we have detected several sex-specific effects. These results suggest that genomic analyses, involving leptin, should be estimated by sex and consider population-specificity for more precise estimations.</AbstractText>"}

Dietary sodium and potassium were assessed by flame photometry using 24-h urine samples, and a sodium-to-potassium ratio was calculated from the resulting measures. Patella and tibia bone lead concentrations were measured by K-shell-x-ray fluorescence. Urinary lead was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy in 24-h urine samples. Linear regression models were used to regress creatinine clearance-corrected urinary lead on bone lead, testing multiplicative interactions with tertiles of sodium, potassium, and sodium-to-potassium ratio, separately. After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, vitamin C intake, calcium, and total energy intake, participants in the highest tertile of sodium-to-potassium ratio showed 28.1% (95% CI: 12.5%, 45.9%) greater urinary lead per doubling increase in patella lead, whereas those in the second and lowest tertiles had 13.8% (95% CI: -1.7%, 31.7%) and 5.5% (95% CI: -8.0%, 21.0%) greater urinary lead, respectively (<i>p</i>-for-interaction = 0.04).

We studied the effect of four flavonoid compounds including naringin, hesperedin, hesperitin, neohesperidin, as well as their different combinations on the CLS of the yeast strain BY4742. Their ROS scavenging ability, in vitro antioxidant activity and the influence on the extracellular pH were also tested. The results showed that neohesperidin extended the yeast's CLS in a concentration-dependent manner. Especially, we found that neohesperidin showed great potential in extending CLS of budding yeast individually or synergistically with hesperetin. The neohesperidin exhibited the strongest function in decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in yeast. These findings clearly indicated that neohesperidin is potentially an anti-aging citrus flavonoid, and its synergistic effect with other flavonoids on yeast's CLS will be an interesting subject for future research of the anti-aging function of citrus fruits.</AbstractText>"}

Few studies have been reported for the function of the other components in velvet antler. Herein, C. elegans is used as the model animal to dissect how none protein components of velvet antler affect in vivo oxidative stress. Methanol extracts (MEs) from velvet antler which has few protein components extends the maximum lifespan of C. elegans compared to the control under oxidative stress, while water extracts (WEs) which is protein-rich component has no apparent function. The activity of MEs is mediated by clk-1 signaling pathway, but not via daf-2, eat-2 or glp-1 pathway. Further investigations show MEs decrease endogenous ROS by promoting SKN-1 nuclei translocation, subsequently up-regulating the expression of its target genes gst-4, gst-7 and gst-10 in C. elegans. In all, MEs, the none protein components of velvet antler, protects against oxidative stress in C. elegans, which indicates it might be a product with potential of being a curative medicine.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Pathologically, these symptoms follow the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) associated with abnormal α-synuclein (α-Syn) deposition as cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies in pigmented brainstem nuclei, and in dystrophic neurons in striatal and cortical regions (Lewy neurites). Pharmacotherapy for PD focuses on improving quality of life and primarily targets dopaminergic pathways. Dopamine acts through two families of receptors, dopamine D1-like and dopamine D2-like; dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) belong to dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) family. Although D3R's precise role in the pathophysiology and treatment of PD has not been determined, we present evidence suggesting an important role for D3R in the early development and occurrence of PD. Agonist activation of D3R increases dopamine concentration, decreases α-Syn accumulation, enhances secretion of brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), ameliorates neuroinflammation, alleviates oxidative stress, promotes neurogenesis in the nigrostriatal pathway, interacts with D1R to reduce PD associated motor symptoms and ameliorates side effects of levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment. Furthermore, D3R mutations can predict PD age of onset and prognosis of PD treatment. The role of D3R in PD merits further research. This review elucidates the potential role of D3R in PD pathogenesis and therapy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sarcopenia is typically characterized as the accumulation of damaged products due to an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. This imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation is attributed to impaired autophagic signal pathways. Sarcopenia can predispose elderly patients to several complications that may significantly impact patient quality of life. Recent evidence indicates that autophagy is required for the control of skeletal muscle mass under catabolic conditions and plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis and integrity of skeletal muscle, specifically at appropriate level of autophagy. Exercise may be considered as a stress stimulus that can substantially modulate cellular signaling to promote metabolic adaptations. Appropriate exercise can induce autophagy or regulate the functional status of autophagy. Additionally, exercise-induced autophagy is the most effective treatment available in slowing down sarcopenia, improving mitochondrial quality, and the number of quiescent satellite cells, as a process that depends on basal autophagy. The molecular mechanisms underpinning the development of sarcopenia, however, remained largely unknown. In this narrative review, the current molecular mechanisms of sarcopenia are discussed from the perspective of exercise-induced autophagy and the effect of different exercise modalities on this response. This narrative review will aim to provide the references for developing scientific and optimal intervention strategies including exercise intervention for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia through regulating autophagic signal pathways.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The major metabolic pathway of tryptophan, an essential amino acid in humans, is the kynurenine pathway (KP) in which indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) catalyze the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. Importantly, circulating kynurenine produced by this enzymatic breakdown, as a primary driver of the aging process, has been linked to higher mortality in humans. This review discusses the potential roles of tryptophan derivatives as biomarkers for the risk of frailty in the elderly, based on human observational studies as well as the KP as a therapeutic target for age-related diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This flexibility underlies fundamental features of neural circuitry including the brain's ability to sense, store, and properly adapt to everchanging external stimuli on time scales from seconds to years. Evidence for most forms of plasticity are centered around changes in neuronal structure and synaptic strength, however recent data suggests that myelinating oligodendrocytes exhibit certain forms of plasticity in the adult. This plasticity ranges from the generation of entirely new myelinating cells to more subtle changes in myelin sheath length, thickness, and distribution along axons. The extent to which these changes dynamically modify axonal function and neural circuitry and whether they are directly related to mechanisms of learning and memory remains an open question. Here we describe different forms of myelin plasticity, highlight some recent evidence for changes in myelination throughout life, and discuss how defects in these forms of plasticity could be associated with cognitive decline in aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Data demonstrate that the elderly constitute a population especially sensitive to this noxious environmental pollutant. We also demonstrated here that the daily consumption of sun-dried Pedro Ximénez (PX) white-grape must (PXM) protects the liver of aged mice from both the age and the damages caused by p,p'-DDE exposure. The PXM activity was exerted through the restoration of the hepatic metabolisms of lipids and carbohydrates and, probably, is a consequence of the ability of this polyphenol-rich mixture to avoid oxidative stress.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is thought to address the neuronal network dysfunction of this disorder and may offer new therapeutic options. Preliminary evidence suggests that DBS of the fornix may have effects on cognitive decline, brain glucose metabolism, hippocampal volume and cortical grey matter volume in certain patients with mild AD. Rodent studies have shown that increase of cholinergic neurotransmitters, hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and reduction of amyloid plaques are associated with DBS. Currently a large phase III study of fornix DBS is assessing efficacy in patients with mild AD aged 65 years and older. The Nucleus basalis of Meynert has also been explored in a phase I study in of mild to moderate AD and was tolerated well regardless of the lack of benefit. Being an established therapy for Parkinson's Disease (PD), DBS may exert some disease-modifying traits rather than being a purely symptomatic treatment. There is evidence of dopaminergic neuroprotection in animal models and some suggestion that DBS may influence the natural progression of the disorder. Neuromodulation may possibly have beneficial effects on course of different neurodegenerative disorders compared to medical therapy alone.

Decades of basic and clinical studies have identified numerous ototoxic agents and investigated their modes of action on the inner ear, utilizing tissue culture as well as animal and human models. Current preventive and therapeutic approaches are considered unsatisfactory. Therefore, additional modalities should be developed. Many studies suggest that increased levels of oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and glutamate play an important role in the initiation and progression of damage to the inner ear leading to hearing impairments. To prevent these cellular deficits, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and antagonists of glutamate receptor have been used individually or in combination with limited success. It is essential, therefore, to simultaneously enhance the levels of antioxidant enzymes by activating the Nrf2 (a nuclear transcriptional factor) pathway, dietary and endogenous antioxidant compounds, and B12-vitamins in order to reduce the levels of oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and glutamate at the same time. This review presents evidence to show that increased levels of these cellular metabolites, biochemical or factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cochlea leading to hearing impairments. It presents scientific rationale for the use of a mixture of micronutrients that may decrease the levels of oxidative damage, chronic inflammation, and glutamate at the same time. The benefits for using oral administration of proposed micronutrient mixture in humans are presented. Animal and limited human studies indirectly suggest that orally administered micronutrients can accumulate in the inner ear. Therefore, this route of administration may be useful in prevention, and in combination with standard care, in improved management of hearing problems following exposure to well-recognized and studied ototoxic agents, such as noise, cisplatin, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and advanced age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Turning while walking (dynamic) and in-place (stable) are ubiquitous aspects of mobility and have substantial consequences if performed poorly. Further, turning is thought to require higher cortical control compared to bouts of straight-ahead walking. This study sought to understand how relative amounts of corticospinal inhibition as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation and the cortical silent period within the primary motor cortices are associated with various turning characteristics in neurotypical young (YA) and older adults (OA). In the current study, OA had reduced peak turn velocity and increased turn duration for both dynamic and stable turns. Further, OA demonstrated significantly reduced corticospinal inhibition within the right motor cortex. Finally, all associations between corticospinal inhibition and turning performance were specific to the right hemisphere, reflecting that those OA who maintained high levels of inhibition performed turning similar to their younger counterparts. These results compliment the right hemisphere model of aging and lateralization specification of cortically regulated temporal measures of dynamic movement. While additional investigations are required, these pilot findings provide an additional understanding as to the neural control of dynamic movements.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

Partial organ resection is not only a common clinical approach in cancer therapy but also an experimental injury model used to examine mechanisms of regeneration and repair in organs. We performed a partial resection, or partial sialoadenectomy, in the female murine submandibular salivary gland (SMG) to establish a model for investigation of repair mechanisms in salivary glands (SGs). After partial sialoadenectomy, we performed whole-gland measurements over a period of 56 d and found that the gland increased slightly in size. We used microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine messenger RNA and protein changes in glands over time. Microarray analysis identified dynamic changes in the transcriptome 3 d after injury that were largely resolved by day 14. At the 3-d time point, we detected gene signatures for cell cycle regulation, inflammatory/repair response, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the partially resected glands. Using quantitative IHC, we identified a transient proliferative response throughout the gland. Both secretory epithelial and stromal cells expressed Ki67 that was detectable at day 3 and largely resolved by day 14. IHC also revealed that while most of the gland underwent a wound-healing response that resolved by day 14, a small region of the gland showed an aberrant sustained fibrotic response characterized by increased levels of ECM deposition, sustained Ki67 levels in stromal cells, and a persistent M2 macrophage response through day 56. The partial submandibular salivary gland resection model provides an opportunity to examine a normal healing response and an aberrant fibrotic response within the same gland to uncover mechanisms that prevent wound healing and regeneration in mammals. Understanding regional differences in the wound-healing responses may ultimately affect regenerative therapies for patients.</AbstractText>"}

Characterization of the driving forces behind protein oxidation, such as exercise, can contribute to improved understanding of whole body protein metabolism. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of two levels of aerobic exercise intensity on immediate post-exercise exogenous protein oxidation. Sixteen healthy males with a mean (SD) age of 24 (4) years participated. The subjects' VO2-max was estimated with the Åstrand cycling test. Habitual dietary intake was assessed with a three-day food diary. Exogenous protein oxidation was measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. These measurements were initiated after the ingestion of a 30 g 13C-milk protein test drink that was followed by 330 minutes breath sample collection. On three different days with at least one week in between, exogenous protein oxidation was measured: 1) during rest, 2) after 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at 30% of VO2-max (moderate intensity), and 3) after 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at 60% of VO2-max (vigorous intensity). After vigorous intensity aerobic exercise, 31.8%±8.0 of the 30 g 13C-milk protein was oxidized compared to 26.2%±7.1 during resting condition (p = 0.012), and 25.4%±7.6 after moderate intensity aerobic exercise compared to resting (p = 0.711). In conclusion, exogenous protein oxidation is increased after vigorous intensity aerobic exercise which could be the result of an increased protein turnover rate.</AbstractText>"}

We manipulated maternal and paternal ages at breeding over 2 generations in the neriid fly Telostylinus angusticollis. To determine whether breeding age effects can be modulated by the environment, we also manipulated larval diet and male competitive environment in the first generation.

Isomer-resolved ion mobility mass spectrometry measurements and reaction-diffusion kinetic simulations are in good agreement, elucidating new mechanisms of dimerization by organic radical (i.e., peroxy and alkoxy radicals) cross reactions using glutaric acid as a surrogate oxygenated OA. These radical reactions are predicted to occur more prominently near the gas-particle interface following oxidation, especially in diffusion-limited viscous OA particles. Chemical structure analysis shows that esters dominate the detected dimers, followed by organic peroxides and ethers, highlighting the importance of acyl peroxy and acyloxy radicals. Simulations suggest that the reported dimer formation through the new interfacial mechanism could be appreciable under both laboratory and ambient conditions. Therefore, the dimers that are formed and enriched at the gas-particle interface are expected to play a crucial role in the effective reactivity, volatility, viscosity, and hygroscopicity of aged OA particles.</AbstractText>"}

Underpinning EF performance are functional nodes in the executive control network (ECN), while the structural connectivity underlying this network is not well understood. In this paper, we evaluated the structural white matter tracts that interconnect the ECN and investigated their relationship to the EF performance. Using high-angular resolution diffusion MRI data, we performed tractography analysis of structural connectivity in a cognitively normal cohort (n = 140), specifically targeting the connectivity between ECN nodes. Our data revealed the presence of a strongly-connected 'structural core' of the ECN comprising three components: interhemispheric frontal connections, a fronto-parietal subnetwork and fronto-striatal connections between right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right caudate. These pathways were strongly correlated with EF performance (p = .003). Post-hoc analysis of subregions within the significant ECN connections showed that these effects were driven by a highly specific subset of interconnected cortical regions. The structural core subnetwork of the functional ECN may be an important feature crucial to a better future understanding of human cognition and behaviour.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

To meet these criteria, farmers must have livestock well adapted to local organic conditions and information about how different breeds and crosses perform under different conditions. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of different pure breeds and cross-breeds of cattle in organic dairy systems in Northern Spain. The data analysed were obtained from monthly records kept between 2010 and 2016 on organic farms registered in the regional milk recording system. Analysis of various traits indicated that the Holstein-Friesian breed suits the organic production system in the study region. Although the reproductive performance of Holstein-Friesian cows was poorer (in terms of number of services per conception) than that of cross-breed and Brown Swiss cows, the Holstein-Friesian produced more milk and lived longer. In addition, there was no difference in calving type or calving ease between the different breed groups. The better milk fat and protein yields produced by the crosses may be useful traits for farmers interested in milk transformation. The advantage of continuing to use Holstein-Friesian cattle is that the breed is predominant worldwide, and the genealogy is well documented. If Holstein-Friesian cattle continue to be used, the main priority will be to search for well-adapted bulls (particularly for pasture-based conditions) and to elaborate a genetic merit index for organic and pasture-based systems with the aim of predicting and minimizing genotype × environment interactions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It has been noted that these chronic pain-related alterations may resemble changes found in healthy aging, and thus may represent accelerated or pre-mature aging of the brain. Here we test the hypothesis that patients with chronic non-cancer pain demonstrate accelerated brain aging compared to healthy control subjects. The predicted brain age of 59 patients with chronic pain (mean chronological age ± standard deviation: 53.0 ± 9.0 years; 43 women) and 60 pain-free healthy controls (52.6 ± 9.0 years; 44 women) was determined using the software brainageR. This software segments the individual T1-weighted structural MR images into gray and white matter and compares gray and white matter images to a large (n = 2001) training set of structural images, using machine learning. Finally, brain age delta, which is the predicted brain age minus chronological age, was calculated and compared across groups. This study provided no evidence for the hypothesis that chronic pain is associated with accelerated brain aging (Welch's t-test, p = 0.74, Cohen's d = 0.061). A Bayesian independent samples t-test indicated moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (BF01 = 4.875, i.e. group means were equal). Our results provide indirect support for recent models of pain related-changes of brain structure, brain function, and cognitive functions.

We used two-photon microscopy to monitor BBB permeability of sodium fluorescein (376 Da), Alexa Fluor (643 Da), and fluorescent albumin (45 kDA).

The most common pathological hallmarks are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. In the brains of patients with AD, pathological tau is abnormally accumulated causing neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. We found a histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor, CKD-504, changed the tau interactome dramatically to degrade pathological tau not only in AD animal model (ADLP<sup>APT</sup> ) brains containing both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also in AD patient-derived brain organoids. Acetylated tau recruited chaperone proteins such as Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110, and this complex bound to novel tau E3 ligases including UBE2O and RNF14. This complex degraded pathological tau through proteasomal pathway. We also identified the responsible acetylation sites on tau. These dramatic tau-interactome changes may result in tau degradation, leading to the recovery of synaptic pathology and cognitive decline in the ADLP<sup>APT</sup> mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Increasing age is an important factor in its pathogenesis. This experiment was to evaluate the comprehensive effect of calcium with vitamin D3 (CaD) on SOP based on multilayer perception (MLP)-artificial neural network (ANN) methods. 15-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered CaD for 2 months, while 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15- and 17-month-old rats were used as the mature or aging control groups.

Our data showed that bone mass, BMD, maximal load, ultimate displacement, ALP and TRACP in serum and tibia, and the protein and mRNA expressions of ATP6v0d2, IGF-1, BMP2, M-CSF, Wnt5a and TGF-β1 in tibia reached a peak in 6 m rats, and then were gradually decreased with the increase of age to the lowest in 17 m rats. This study demonstrated the degeneration of the bone structure and bone metabolism in SOP rats during the aging process of rats aged 3 to 17 months. CaD could effectively increase bone mass and bone strength, alleviate the degradation of the bone microstructure and rebalance bone remodeling. In addition, the MLP model was a comprehensive method for evaluating the effects of drugs on SOP, which provided a new direction for future drug and nutrition evaluation.</AbstractText>"}

The costs are borne by families, by private insurance and by society via public programs such as Medicaid in the U.S.. There is extensive research on the relationship between dementia and <i>annual</i> medical spending. This paper, instead, estimates cumulative <i>lifetime</i> medical expenditures that can be attributed to the onset of dementia using a nationally representative longitudinal survey from the U.S., the Health and Retirement Study. The lifetime expenditures are estimated by summing any out-of-pocket medical spending reported in the panel from age 65 to death. Censored cases are imputed using a non-parametric matching algorithm called splicing. For example, survivors to the most recent wave are matched to similar individuals from older cohorts who are observed at the relevant ages all the way through death. We find that those who live with dementia for at least half a year pay, on average, $38,540 more out of pocket from age 65 to death when controlling for length of life, demographics, lifetime earnings and comorbidities. The costs of dementia are almost exclusively due to spending on nursing homes. Spending on drugs, doctor visits or hospitals, is not significantly related to dementia. The lifetime costs of dementia are significantly larger for white and rich individuals, perhaps because they use higher quality nursing homes and because they have more financial resources to spend down before becoming eligible for Medicaid support.</AbstractText>"}

Central to the biogenesis, content, and function of EVs are their delimiting lipid bilayer membranes. To evaluate research progress on membranes and EVs, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) conducted a workshop in March 2018 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, bringing together key opinion leaders and hands-on researchers who were selected on the basis of submitted applications. The workshop was accompanied by two scientific surveys and covered four broad topics: EV biogenesis and release; EV uptake and fusion; technologies and strategies used to study EV membranes; and EV transfer and functional assays. In this ISEV position paper, we synthesize the results of the workshop and the related surveys to outline important outstanding questions about EV membranes and describe areas of consensus. The workshop discussions and survey responses reveal that while much progress has been made in the field, there are still several concepts that divide opinion. Good consensus exists in some areas, including particular aspects of EV biogenesis, uptake and downstream signalling. Areas with little to no consensus include EV storage and stability, as well as whether and how EVs fuse with target cells. Further research is needed in these key areas, as a better understanding of membrane biology will contribute substantially towards advancing the field of extracellular vesicles.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).

Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were incubated with various concentrations of Crocetin (1, 5, 25, 50, and 100 µM) over a period of 72 h. Crocetin significantly increased HUVECs viability after 72 h as compared with the control group.

Moreover, an improved migration rate and increased MMP-9 activity were observed in HUVECs that received 50 µM Crocetin (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). Crocetin enhanced the uptake of Ac-LDL which is correlated with increased lipid metabolism.

It is usually difficult to compare the effects of alternative reproductive modes because of evolutionary and ecological divergence. However, the very rare exemplars of reproductive bimodality, in which different modes exist within a single species, offer an opportunity for robust and controlled comparisons.One trait of interest that could be associated with life history, ageing and longevity is the length of the telomeres, which form protective caps at the chromosome ends and are generally considered a good indicator of cellular health. The shortening of these telomeres has been linked to stressful conditions; therefore, it is possible that differing reproductive costs will influence patterns of telomere loss. This is important because a number of studies have linked a shorter telomere length to reduced survival.Here, we have studied maternal and offspring telomere dynamics in the common lizard (<i>Zootoca vivipara</i>). Our study has focused on a population where oviparous and viviparous individuals co-occur in the same habitat and occasionally interbreed to form admixed individuals.While viviparity confers many advantages for offspring, it might also incur substantial costs for the mother, for example require more energy. Therefore, we predicted that viviparous mothers would have relatively shorter telomeres than oviparous mothers, with admixed mothers having intermediate telomere lengths. There is thought to be a heritable component to telomere length; therefore, we also hypothesized that offspring would follow the same pattern as the mothers.Contrary to our predictions, the viviparous mothers and offspring had the longest telomeres, and the oviparous mothers and offspring had the shortest telomeres. The differing telomere lengths may have evolved as an effect of the life-history divergence between the reproductive modes, for example due to the increased growth rate that viviparous individuals may undergo to reach a similar size at reproduction.

Over a lifetime, hearing loss can be acquired from numerous etiologies such as exposure to excessive noise, the use of ototoxic medications, bacterial or viral ear infections, head injuries, and the aging process. Loss of sensory hair cells is a common pathological feature of the varieties of acquired hearing loss. Additionally, the inner hair cell synapse can be damaged by mild insults. Therefore, surface preparations of cochlear epithelia, in combination with immunolabeling techniques and confocal imagery, are a very useful tool for the investigation of cochlear pathologies, including losses of ribbon synapses and sensory hair cells, changes in protein levels in hair cells and supporting cells, hair cell regeneration, and determination of report gene expression (i.e., GFP) for verification of successful transduction and identification of transduced cell types. The cochlea, a bony spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear, holds the auditory sensory end organ, the organ of Corti (OC). Sensory hair cells and surrounding supporting cells in the OC are contained in the cochlear duct and rest on the basilar membrane, organized in a tonotopic fashion with high-frequency detection occurring in the base and low-frequency in the apex. With the availability of molecular and genetic information and the ability to manipulate genes by knockout and knock-in techniques, mice have been widely used in biological research, including in hearing science. However, the adult mouse cochlea is miniscule, and the cochlear epithelium is encapsulated in a bony labyrinth, making microdissection difficult. Although dissection techniques have been developed and used in many laboratories, this modified microdissection method using cell and tissue adhesive is easier and more convenient. It can be used in all types of adult mouse cochleae following decalcification.</AbstractText>"}

A simple unifying hypothesis suggests that REST is a 'goldilocks-effect factor': too little REST promotes excitotoxic activity, which in turn leads to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Appropriate increased levels of REST maintain the excitation/inhibition (E-I) balance by reducing potential excitotoxic activity. Increased levels of REST beyond this are toxic as neurons become dysfunctional due to loss of a neuronal phenotype.</AbstractText>"}

Twenty young (2-3-month-old) female mice, 20 adult (9-10-month-old) female mice and 12 aged (14-15-month-old) female mice were divided into two groups (control and rTMS treatment). rTMS-treated groups were subjected to high-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS treatment for 15 days. Novel object recognition (NOR) and step-down tests were performed to examine cognition of learning and memory. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record the resting membrane potential (RMP) and action potential (AP), and the intrinsic properties of the AP were analyzed (the frequence of AP, the after hyperpolarizing potential (AHP), the AP peak amplitude, the time to AP amplitude, the average rise/down slope). Results showed that the cognition and neuronal excitability of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells were significantly declined only in aged animals while no statistic differences were found between young and adult animals. Chronic high-frequency rTMS could significantly improve the age-related cognitive impairment in parallel with enhancing the DG granule cells' neuronal excitability.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies showed that EVOO supplementation improves Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like amyloidotic phenotype of transgenic mice. However, while much attention has been focused on EVOO-mediated modulation of Aβ processing, its direct influence on tau metabolism in vivo and synaptic function is still poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic supplementation of EVOO on the phenotype of a relevant mouse model of tauopathy, human transgenic tau mice (hTau). Starting at 6 months of age, hTau mice were fed chow diet supplemented with EVOO or vehicle for additional 6 months, and then the effect on their phenotype was assessed. At the end of the treatment, compared with control mice receiving EVOO displayed improved memory and cognition which was associated with increased basal synaptic activity and short-term plasticity. This effect was accompanied by an upregulation of complexin 1, a key presynaptic protein. Moreover, EVOO treatment resulted in a significant reduction of tau oligomers and phosphorylated tau at specific epitopes. Our findings demonstrate that EVOO directly improves synaptic activity, short-term plasticity, and memory while decreasing tau neuropathology in the hTau mice. These results strengthen the healthy benefits of EVOO and further support the therapeutic potential of this natural product not only for AD but also for primary tauopathies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Deeper mechanistic insight on the generation of Aβ43 is still lacking, and it is unclear whether γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) can reduce the levels of this Aβ species. By comparing several types of Aβ43-generating FAD mutants, we observe that very high levels of Aβ43 are often produced when presenilin function is severely impaired. Altered interactions of C99, the precursor of Aβ, are found for all mutants and are independent of their particular effect on Aβ production. Furthermore, unlike previously described GSMs, the novel compound RO7019009 can effectively lower Aβ43 production of all mutants. Finally, substrate-binding competition experiments suggest that RO7019009 acts mechanistically after initial C99 binding. We conclude that altered C99 interactions are a common feature of diverse types of PS1 FAD mutants and that also patients with Aβ43-generating FAD mutations could in principle be treated by GSMs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of microRNA miR-188 in the aging-associated metabolic phenotype. The results showed that the expression of miR-188 increased gradually in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of mice during aging. MiR-188 knockout mice were resistant to the aging-associated metabolic phenotype and had higher energy expenditure. Meanwhile, adipose tissue-specific miR-188 transgenic mice displayed the opposite phenotype. Mechanistically, we identified the thermogenic-related gene Prdm16 (encoding PR domain containing 16) as the direct target of miR-188. Notably, inhibition of miR-188 expression in BAT and iWAT of aged mice by tail vein injection of antagomiR-188 ameliorated aging-associated metabolic dysfunction significantly. Taken together, our findings suggested that miR-188 plays an important role in the regulation of the aging-associated metabolic phenotype, and targeting miR-188 could be an effective strategy to prevent aging-associated metabolic dysfunction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Age-related functional decline in the brain is often attributed to a failure of protein homeostasis (proteostasis), largely in postmitotic neurons, which accordingly is a process distinct by definition from senescence. It is nevertheless possible that proteostasis failure and cellular senescence have overlapping molecular mechanisms. Here, we identify postmitotic cellular senescence as an adaptive stress response to proteostasis failure. Primary rat hippocampal neurons in long-term cultures show molecular changes indicative of both senescence (senescence-associated β-galactosidase, p16, and loss of lamin B1) and proteostasis failure relevant to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we demonstrate that the senescent neurons exhibit resistance to stress. Importantly, treatment of the cultures with an mTOR antagonist, protein synthesis inhibitor, or chemical compound that reduces the amount of protein aggregates relieved the proteotoxic stresses as well as the appearance of senescence markers. Our data propose mechanistic insights into the pathophysiological brain aging by establishing senescence as a primary cell-autonomous neuroprotective response.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we examine two aging pathologies that have not been studied in detail despite their apparent prevalence; the fusion, elongation, and engulfment of cochlear inner hair cell stereocilia, and the changes that occur to the tectorial membrane (TM), a structure overlying the organ of Corti that modulates its physical properties in response to sound. Our work demonstrates that similar pathological changes occur in these two structures in the aging cochleae of both mice and humans, examines the ultrastructural changes that underlie stereocilial fusion, and identifies the lost TM components that lead to changes in membrane structure. We place these changes into the context of the wider pathology of the aging cochlea, and identify how they may be important in particular for understanding the more subtle hearing pathologies that precede auditory threshold loss in ARHL.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the skin, aging manifests itself in photodamage and dermal atrophy, with underlying tissue reduction and impaired barrier function. To determine whether rapamycin, an FDA-approved drug targeting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex, can reduce senescence and markers of aging in human skin, an exploratory, placebo-controlled, interventional trial was conducted in a clinical dermatology setting. Participants were greater than 40 years of age with evidence of age-related photoaging and dermal volume loss and no major morbidities. Thirty-six participants were enrolled in the study, and nineteen discontinued or were lost to follow-up. A significant (P = 0.008) reduction in p16<sup>INK4A</sup> protein levels and an increase in collagen VII protein levels (P = 0.0077) were observed among participants at the end of the study. Clinical improvement in skin appearance was noted in multiple participants, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed improvement in histological appearance of skin tissue. Topical rapamycin reduced the expression of the p16<sup>INK4A</sup> protein consistent with a reduction in cellular senescence. This change was accompanied by relative improvement in clinical appearance of the skin and histological markers of aging and by an increase in collagen VII, which is critical to the integrity of the basement membrane.

Recent studies suggest that DR-driven lifespan extension can be cost-free, calling into question a central tenant of the evolutionary theory of ageing. Nevertheless, boosting parental longevity can reduce offspring fitness. Such intergenerational trade-offs are often ignored but can account for the 'missing costs' of longevity. Here, we use the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei to test for effects of DR by fasting on fitness of females and their offspring. Females deprived of food for six days indeed had increased fecundity, survival and stress resistance after re-exposure to food compared to their counterparts with constant food access. However, offspring of DR mothers had reduced early and lifetime fecundity, slower growth rate, and smaller body size at sexual maturity.

Results The K group more frequently was male, older, coinfected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and had diabetes mellitus, a history of upper digestive system surgery, alcohol drinking habit, a smoking habit, and an impaired premorbid performance status than the S group. The percentages of lung abscesses or necrotizing pneumonia (31.6% vs. 0.9%) and empyema without pulmonary parenchymal shadow (3.9% vs. 0.7%) were higher in the K group than those in the S group. Severity on admission and mortality did not differ between the groups; however, patients in the K group required a longer duration of antibiotics administration and hospital stay than those in the S group. Conclusion Klebsiella spp. chest infections have some marked characteristics when compared with pneumococcal infections, and our results serve to differentiate Klebsiella spp. infection from pneumococcal infection.</AbstractText>"}

At present, family members primarily perform injection at home and measure the blood glucose levels for patients who require these procedures. However, as aging progresses and the birthrate further declines, it is expected that it will become difficult for such patients to receive assistance from their family members. Therefore, a discussion at the national level and development of urgent measures are required. In the future, the expanded involvement of those with medical qualifications and augmented multi-occupational collaboration-specifically, increasing the frequency of visiting nursing services, facilitating injections at home by pharmacists and making the most of 'community-based integrated care systems', without major changes in the current legislation, will be foremost in reinforcing or taking the place of family members performing injections at home and measuring blood glucose levels. If cost is given the highest priority, injection at home and measurement of blood glucose levels by non-medical and non-nursing care workers seems to be the best option. However, careful deliberation is required.</AbstractText>"}

After the re-annotation of lncRNAs, a gene expression similarity analysis was done by WGCNA. The target mRNA prediction of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and ceRNA regulatory networks were constructed by five lncRNAs, 14 miRNAs and 54 mRNAs, respectively. Based on the ceRNA network of UVB-induced skin lesions, it was evident that the dysregulation of Meg3 has critical effects on the UVB-induced inflammatory lesion of murine skin tissues. The overexpression of Meg3 after UVB irradiation was observed in primary murine skin fibroblasts, and the up-regulated Meg3 expression was related to the activation of the inflammatory cytokines. These functional experiments demonstrated that the RNA silencing of Meg3 in murine skin fibroblasts could suppress the expression of the cytokines (<i>in vitro</i>) and UVB-induced skin lesions (<i>in vivo)</i>. Moreover, the Meg3 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that acted as a sponge for miR-93-5p and thereby modulated the expression of Epiregulin (Ereg). Our results proved that Meg3 was involved in UVB-induced skin inflammation and that the ceRNA networks, which includes miR-93-5p and Ereg, could prove to be a potential therapeutic target for UVB-induced skin damage.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we investigated the role of histone deubiquitinase MYSM1 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa). Tissues and public datasets of PCa were evaluated for MYSM1 levels. We explored the effects of MYSM1 on cell proliferation, senescence and viability both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Integrative database analyses and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to elucidate genomic association of MYSM1 and MYSM1-involved biological interaction network in PCa. We observed that MYSM1 were downregulated in CRPC compared to localized prostate tumors. Knockdown of MYSM1 promoted cell proliferation and suppressed senescence of CRPC cells under condition of androgen ablation. MYSM1 downregulation enhanced the tumorigenic ability in nude mice. Integrative bioinformatic analyses of the significantly associated genes with MYSM1 revealed MYSM1-correlated pathways, providing substantial clues as to the role of MYSM1 in PCa. MYSM1 was able to bind to androgen receptor instead of increasing its expression and knockdown of MYSM1 resulted in activation of Akt/c-Raf/GSK-3β signaling. Together, our findings indicate that MYSM1 is pivotal in CRPC pathogenesis and may be established as a potential target for future treatment.</AbstractText>"}

Although compelling evidence supports reduced segregation and increased integration in whole-brain functional connectivity with aging, the age effect on the reorganization of large-scale functional networks at the hemispheric level remains unclear. Here, we aimed to examine age-related differences in inter-hemispheric interactions and intra-hemispheric integration by using resting-state functional MRI data of a healthy adult lifespan sample. The results showed that age-related decreases in inter-hemispheric integration were found in entire functional networks in both hemispheres, except for the sensorimotor network (SMN) and posterior default mode network (DMN). Specifically, aging was accompanied by increasing inter-hemispheric segregation in the left frontoparietal network (FPN) and left ventral attention network (VAN), as well as right-brain networks located in the auditory network (AN), visual network (VN), and temporal parts of the DMN. Moreover, aging was associated with increasing intra-hemispheric integration within the bilateral VN and posterior DMN while decreasing intra-hemispheric integration within the right VAN. These remarkable changes with aging confirm that there are dynamic interactions between functional networks across the lifespan and provide a means of investigating the mechanisms of cognitive aging.</AbstractText>"}

MAPK signaling plays a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, transcriptional regulation, and development. However, specific function and mechanism of MAP2K4 in breast cancer have not been clarified. According to our study, overexpressed MAP2K4 in breast cancer cells increased proliferation, migration, and invasion in vivo and in vitro, while MAP2K4 knockdown restored the effects. Subsequent mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MAP2K4 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, the downstream proteins, c-JUN, the G1/S cell cycle, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Meanwhile, MAP2K4 interacted with Vimentin and further propagated the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, patients with high MAP2K4 and Vimentin expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression levels of both proteins. Our studies demonstrated that MAP2K4 has the potential to serve as an oncogene in breast cancer and it activates the phosphorylated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to activate downstream cycle-associated proteins and EMT signals while interacting with Vimentin to promote breast cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. In our study, MAP2K4 and Vimentin co-expression is confirmed to be an unfavorable factor in breast cancer.</AbstractText>"}

Next, we identified significant Gene Ontology and pathway terms that the differentially expressed transcripts involved in. Using functional analysis and target prediction, we constructed a hepatocellular carcinoma-associated deregulated competitive endogenous RNA network to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying tumor progression.

Here, we show that the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes secretes a small RBP that we named Zea. We show that Zea binds a subset of L. monocytogenes RNAs, causing their accumulation in the extracellular medium. Furthermore, during L. monocytogenes infection, Zea binds RIG-I, the non-self-RNA innate immunity sensor, potentiating interferon-β production. Mouse infection studies reveal that Zea affects L. monocytogenes virulence.

The most common indications for autologous HCT are multiple myeloma and lymphoma, and for allogenic HCT are acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Older adults into their eighth decade of life can have favorable outcomes after autologous and allogeneic HCT, at least among select patients. Evaluation of older adults prior to HCT can be aided by utilizing a geriatric assessment (GA). GA can identify areas of vulnerability in older adults prior to HCT not captured by more traditional measures. In the future, GA may be utilized to guide interventions prior to HCT to improve outcomes of older adults. Further studies are needed to expand the paucity of data in utilizing GA to identify three groups of patients: those who clearly benefit from HCT, those who would clearly be harmed, and those who might benefit but would require additional support during and after HCT.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Biological aging is characterized by e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic alterations (e.g. methylation) - mechanisms that are also important in cancer development. For CRC, specific types of tumors are distinguishable by their methylation patterns and several detection methods using different epigenetic marks have been developed as signatures for the disease. Biological age assessed by DNA methylation patterns from blood, i.e. the epigenetic clock, is higher in CRC patients compared to controls, and may be a tool for identifying individuals at increased risk for CRC. Other types of biomarkers of aging are useful to calculate biological age, such as metabolites, protein levels, inflammatory markers and clinical biomarkers, where composite scores of biomarkers have been used to assess the risk of CRC and colorectal adenomas. Clinical assessments of biological aging includes frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome characterized by increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes. More than half of the CRC patients are estimated to be frail or pre-frail, and these individuals are at increased risk of postoperative complications, poorer prognosis, treatment intolerance and death. Hence, considering frailty as part of biological age in CRC patients may help identifying those at need of close monitoring. In summary, future screening programs for CRC may make use of biological age assessments, e.g. by epigenetic clock or composite scores. Monitoring disease relapse and treatment response should be enhanced in frail individuals for better prognosis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the investigation and availability of therapies targeted against various molecular drivers of leukemogenesis, leukemic stem cell persistence, and chemoresistance have provided more options for the patient ineligible for intensive or classical induction therapy, often guided by age &gt;60-65 years by some treatment algorithms.

Low muscle mass, due to fewer and/or smaller constituent muscle fibers, would exacerbate the impact of muscle loss occurring in aging or disease. Genetic variability substantially influences muscle mass differences, but causative genes remain largely unknown. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on appendicular lean mass (ALM) in a population of 85,750 middle-aged (aged 38-49 years) individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB), we found 182 loci associated with ALM (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). We replicated associations for 78% of these loci (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) with ALM in a population of 181,862 elderly (aged 60-74 years) individuals from UKB. We also conducted a GWAS on hindlimb skeletal muscle mass of 1,867 mice from an advanced intercross between two inbred strains (LG/J and SM/J); this GWAS identified 23 quantitative trait loci. Thirty-eight positional candidates distributed across five loci overlapped between the two species. In vitro studies of positional candidates confirmed CPNE1 and STC2 as modifiers of myogenesis. Collectively, these findings shed light on the genetics of muscle mass variability in humans and identify targets for the development of interventions for treatment of muscle loss. The overlapping results between humans and the mouse model GWAS point to shared genetic mechanisms across species.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

The primary constituents of the porous product were Ni and Ti. We could adjust the pores' shape, size, and interconnectivity for favorite bone ingrowth by using urea as a space holder. Without urea, we obtained an average porosity of 0.30, and a mean void size of 100 μm. With 70 vol % urea, we got 62% interconnected pores of 400 μm average size. Aging allowed us to tune the austenite-martensite transformation temperatures towards the needed body tissue arouse. Differential scanning calorimetry measured the transformation temperatures. Their austenite start, austenite peak, and austenite finish values were A<sub>s</sub> = 4, A<sub>p</sub> = 22, and A<sub>f</sub> = 34 °C, respectively. They retained functional shape recovery and superelastic effect at the body temperature. Mechanical properties, including Young's modulus of the specimens, matched well to maxilla and mandible bone tissue. The measured Young's modulus of the NiTi specimens was as low as 3.5 GPa, which decreased to ∼2.1 GPa with further porosity increase at higher space holder percentages. Superelasticity regime and low Young's modulus of the implant could potentially prevent stress-shielding from the surrounding bone tissues and give rise to secure fixation of the implant into the bone socket. Bending tests showed 0.9 mm recoverable deflection for specimens which assisted immediate self-fixation of the implant into the jaw bone cavity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the underlying assumptions about mobility often remain fixed on ideas of function and physical ability. The 'new mobilities' paradigm shifts this analysis by focusing on the importance and experience of mobility as a thing in itself rather than a means to an end, and to the complex enactments that operate across a range of relationships, settings, sites, and contexts. This paper provides insight from an embedded case study method comprised of fifteen exploratory interviews with older people at three social locations, including 5 individuals considered 'frail', 5 people who are aging with a disability, and 5 older people who self-identify as 'active'. Considered together and in contrast, the findings from these three distinct but related embedded case sites, viewed from a 'new mobilities' perspective, can help to understand (im)mobility as an embodied experience that is situated within and across social and political contexts, and can explicate how relations of power enhance the mobility of some, and the immobility of others. We conclude that the 'new mobilities' approach introduces ideas to overcome limitations of distance, movement, and place, and in doing so, serves to redefine what it means to be mobile while aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the psychotherapy literature often presumes a collective agreement about how empathy manifests as a clinical tool, in the process institutionalizing the ideal of omnipresent alignment with a client, applied across populations of patients, regardless of their conditions, ages, and personal and cultural characteristics. Misalignments between clinicians and clients have the potential to bely broadly imagined ethics of empathy (and the notion of collective agreement about what it is) by demonstrating the ways tension, difference, and incongruence promote treatment. Through an autoethnography of a 12-month psychotherapy dyad with an elderly woman committed for treatment at a U.S. psychiatric hospital, we discuss how moments of incongruence between clinician and client expand conceptualizations of empathy in treatment of psychosis. Specifically, in this context, deployment of empathy-as-alignment becomes a fallacy of care, risking the effectiveness of treatment through impossible epistemological assumptions of and counterproductive joining with the client. As such, this transtheoretical discussion presents two types of incongruence in the dyad-developmental and subjective-as a backdrop for expressing empathy. This paper makes space for a theory of empathy as the practice of working in genuine and careful service of the client's psychology through acts of incongruence as much as alignment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Research has highlighted that the impact of such programs can extend beyond the primary recipient when funds are shared. It less clear the extent to which such redistribution persists in the lowest resource settings. Using data from a survey conducted in 2016, this paper examines how recipients of the Kenyan Older Persons Cash Transfer Program (OPCTP) living in two slum communities in Nairobi reallocate their social pension by examining the characteristics of older people who are more likely to share their cash and identifying secondary beneficiaries. Findings suggest that 40% of beneficiaries re-allocate some or all of the cash received. The majority of secondary beneficiaries are either grandchildren or children of the primary beneficiary. Overall, a higher proportion of the total cash is shared with secondary beneficiaries living in rural Kenya, as compared to those living in the same household. This highlights the role played by older people, even the most vulnerable, in providing support to wider kin networks; reinforcing the argument that investing in social pensions has much broader potential societal impact than the intended aims of reducing recipient household poverty. By enhancing economic opportunities and investments in human capital more broadly, societies that invest in social pension programs may improve the overall living conditions and experiences of ageing in their countries at a critical moment of global population ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The question posed by this anthropological perspective seems at first sight quite simple: how did this aging come to be? We will see that from a demographic point of view, the answer seems trivial: a basic shift in population structure is at the origin. However, we will go further by exploring the historical and political conditions of this transition by mobilizing the Foucauldian notion of biopower. We argue that this notion has the heuristic advantage of linking several core processes at work in the demographic transition. Although our analysis focuses on France to illustrate the notion of biopower in Foucault's work, we also discuss several non-western societies to explain why demographic aging is inevitable across the globe due to biopower strategies and 'dispositifs'. This article also constitutes a reflexive analysis on our practices as gerontologists and on the widespread 'successful aging' concept.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis shows how successful interaction rituals create positive emotions such as joy and pride and contribute to emotional energy. However, there are also unsuccessful interaction rituals which contribute to negative emotions of sadness and anger. These negative emotions can drain emotional energy, but, importantly for this study, they may also contribute to a forceful counter-energy which motivates the interviewees to try again. We discuss these patterns as emotional energy tropism and as negative emotional energy and positive emotional energy working together.

Nursing home care, in particular, is both characterized by institutional demands for regulation and standardization, and the subjective practices of care workers. These can represent different notions of good care. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among people with dementia, family members and professional caregivers in nursing homes in the Netherlands, I present a case of a resident's sudden death, which revealed a fallacy of care. A fallacy of care refers to an uncritical approach to the 'good' in care that overlooks its potentially harmful outcomes. I show that recognizing such fallacies is not only a matter of recognizing the 'bad' that may result from 'good' care, but of the friction between multiple 'goods.' In this case, protocols and care practices advocate different notions of the good that coexist, compete, and exclude one another, producing moral distress and forming hierarchical, if contested relations.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The recommendations emphasize the importance of considering testing patients with a reasonable level of clinical suspicion of GHD using appropriate growth hormone (GH) cut-points for various GH-stimulation tests to accurately diagnose adult GHD, and to exercise caution interpreting serum GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, as various GH and IGF-1 assays are used to support treatment decisions. The intention to treat often requires sound clinical judgment and careful assessment of the benefits and risks specific to each individual patient. Unapproved uses of GH, long-term safety, and the current status of long-acting GH preparations are also discussed in this document. <b>LAY ABSTRACT</b> This updated guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the identification, screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for a range of individuals with various causes of adult growth-hormone deficiency (GHD) and patients with childhood-onset GHD transitioning to adult care. The update summarizes the most current knowledge about the accuracy of available GH-stimulation tests, safety of recombinant human GH (rhGH) replacement, unapproved uses of rhGH related to sports and aging, and new developments such as long-acting GH preparations that use a variety of technologies to prolong GH action. Recommendations offer a framework for physicians to manage patients with GHD effectively during transition to adult care and adulthood. Establishing a correct diagnosis is essential before consideration of replacement therapy with rhGH. Since the diagnosis of GHD in adults can be challenging, GH-stimulation tests are recommended based on individual patient circumstances and use of appropriate GH cut-points. Available GH-stimulation tests are discussed regarding variability, accuracy, reproducibility, safety, and contraindications, among other factors. The regimen for starting and maintaining rhGH treatment now uses individualized dose adjustments, which has improved effectiveness and reduced reported side effects, dependent on age, gender, body mass index, and various other individual characteristics. With careful dosing of rhGH replacement, many features of adult GHD are reversible and side effects of therapy can be minimized. Scientific studies have consistently shown rhGH therapy to be beneficial for adults with GHD, including improvements in body composition and quality of life, and have demonstrated the safety of short- and long-term rhGH replacement. <b>Abbreviations: AACE</b> = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists; <b>ACE</b> = American College of Endocrinology; <b>AHSG</b> = alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein; <b>AO-GHD</b> = adult-onset growth hormone deficiency; <b>ARG</b> = arginine; <b>BEL</b> = best evidence level; <b>BMD</b> = bone mineral density; <b>BMI</b> = body mass index; <b>CI</b> = confidence interval; <b>CO-GHD</b> = childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency; <b>CPG</b> = clinical practice guideline; <b>CRP</b> = C-reactive protein; <b>DM</b> = diabetes mellitus; <b>DXA</b> = dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; <b>EL</b> = evidence level; <b>FDA</b> = Food and Drug Administration; <b>FD-GST</b> = fixed-dose glucagon stimulation test; <b>GeNeSIS</b> = Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study; <b>GH</b> = growth hormone; <b>GHD</b> = growth hormone deficiency; <b>GHRH</b> = growth hormone-releasing hormone; <b>GST</b> = glucagon stimulation test; <b>HDL</b> = high-density lipoprotein; <b>HypoCCS</b> = Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study; <b>IGF-1</b> = insulin-like growth factor-1; <b>IGFBP</b> = insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; <b>IGHD</b> = isolated growth hormone deficiency; <b>ITT</b> = insulin tolerance test; <b>KIMS</b> = Kabi International Metabolic Surveillance; <b>LAGH</b> = long-acting growth hormone; <b>LDL</b> = low-density lipoprotein; <b>LIF</b> = leukemia inhibitory factor; <b>MPHD</b> = multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies; <b>MRI</b> = magnetic resonance imaging; <b>P-III-NP</b> = procollagen type-III amino-terminal pro-peptide; <b>PHD</b> = pituitary hormone deficiencies; <b>QoL</b> = quality of life; <b>rhGH</b> = recombinant human growth hormone; <b>ROC</b> = receiver operating characteristic; <b>RR</b> = relative risk; <b>SAH</b> = subarachnoid hemorrhage; <b>SDS</b> = standard deviation score; <b>SIR</b> = standardized incidence ratio; <b>SN</b> = secondary neoplasms; <b>T3</b> = triiodothyronine; <b>TBI</b> = traumatic brain injury; <b>VDBP</b> = vitamin D-binding protein; <b>WADA</b> = World Anti-Doping Agency; <b>WB-GST</b> = weight-based glucagon stimulation test.</AbstractText>"}

Although activation of brain insulin signaling has been shown to be neuroprotective, to preserve memory in AD models, and appears beneficial in patients, the role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) remains incompletely understood. We found reduced active/inactive IGF1 ratio and increased IGF1R expression in postmortem hippocampal tissue from AD patients, suggesting impaired brain IGF1 signaling in AD. Active/inactive IGF-1 ratio was also reduced in the brains of mouse models of AD. We next investigated the possible protective role of IGF1 in AD models. We used a recombinant adenoviral vector, RAd-IGF1, to drive the expression of IGF1 in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures prior to exposure to AβOs, toxins that accumulate in AD brains and have been implicated in early synapse dysfunction and memory impairment. Cultures transduced with RAd-IGF1 showed decreased binding of AβOs to neurons and were protected against AβO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and loss of dendritic spines. Significantly, in vivo transduction with RAd-IGF1 blocked memory impairment caused by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of AβOs in mice. Our results demonstrate altered active IGF1 and IGF1R levels in AD hippocampi, and suggest that boosting brain expression of IGF1 may comprise an approach to prevent neuronal damage and memory loss in AD.</AbstractText>"}

We suppose that osteoporosis is nonetheless prima facie evidence for impaired mechanoadaptation; either capacity to accrue new bone declines, or the stimulus for such accrual is absent/can no longer be triggered in the aged. Herein, we provide only sufficient background to enable a focus on recent advances which seek to address such dilemmas.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RECENT FINDINGS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>Recent advances from innovative high-impact loading regimes emphasize the priming of mechanoadaptation in the aged, such that low-to-moderate intensity loading becomes beneficial.

Impaired mechanoadaptation is a feature of the aged skeleton. Recent advances indicate that novel interventional loading regimes can restore mechanoadaptive capacity, enabling new approaches for retaining bone health in the aged. Innovative exercise paradigms appear to be capable of 'hacking' into the osteogenic signal produced by exercise such that low-to-moderate intensity activities may also become more beneficial.

Increasing evidences suggest that these synaptic plasticity genes are regulated through epigenetic modifications. Recently we have reported that the neuronal immediate early genes (IEGs) are regulated by DNA methylation and histone acetylation, and their expression is downregulated in the hippocampus of old male mice, which subsequently results in decline of memory. These modifications do not work in isolation but act synergistically and lead to distinct regulation of gene expression. Therefore, in the present study, we have explored whether these genes are also regulated by histone methylation and this has any correlation with memory decline during aging. This study for the first time reports involvement of H3K9me3 in the regulation of neuronal IEGs during aging. Using novel object recognition and Y-maze test, the recognition and spatial memory was checked in male mice of different ages and it was found to decline in old. We have examined the expression of H3K9me3 specific histone methyltransferases and noted that only SUV39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1) increased significantly in old. Also the global H3K9me3 level was high in the hippocampus of old male mice. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed rise in H3K9me3 level at the promoter of IEGs in old as compared to young male mice. The immunofluorescence analysis also showed varying pattern of H3K9me3 expression in different subregions of hippocampus with aging. These findings showed negative correlation of increase in hippocampal histone H3K9me3 with memory decline in old male mice. Diagram here represents that during aging, there is increase in expression of SUV39H1. Such increased enzyme upregulates global and gene specific methylation in hippocampus of old male mice. H3K9me3 level increases at the promoter of neuronal IEGs leading to heterochromatisation and hence decrease in their expression and ultimately decline in memory during aging.</AbstractText>"}

An unresolved question is to what extent this effect is dependent on the ApoE-ε4, a genotype associated with risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given the current concern about reproducibility in empirical research, we assessed this issue in a large sample (n = 1637) of older adults (60 - 96 years) from the population-based longitudinal Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K). A hierarchical regression analysis was carried out to determine if a low score on an odor identification test, and the presence of ApoE-ε4, would predict the magnitude of a prospective 6-year change in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) after controlling for demographic, health-related, and cognitive variables. We found that overall, lower odor identification performance was predictive of cognitive decline, and, as hypothesized, we found that the effect was most pronounced among ApoE-ε4 carriers. Our results from this high-powered sample suggest that in elderly carriers of the ApoE-ε4 allele, odor identification impairment provides an indication of future cognitive decline, which has relevance for the prognosis of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Through yet poorly defined mechanisms, αSyn crosses mitochondrial outer membrane and targets respiratory complexes leading to bioenergetics defects. Here, using neuronally differentiated human cells overexpressing wild-type αSyn, we show that the major metabolite channel of the outer membrane, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), is a pathway for αSyn translocation into the mitochondria. Importantly, the neuroprotective cholesterol-like synthetic compound olesoxime inhibits this translocation. By applying complementary electrophysiological and biophysical approaches, we provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between αSyn, VDAC, and olesoxime. Our data suggest that olesoxime interacts with VDAC β-barrel at the lipid-protein interface thus hindering αSyn translocation through the VDAC pore and affecting VDAC voltage gating. We propose that targeting αSyn translocation through VDAC could represent a key mechanism for the development of new neuroprotective strategies.</AbstractText>"}

However, it is unknown whether sex impacts cerebrovascular Gq-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and K+ channels underlying endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH) during progressive aging. Thus, we simultaneously evaluated intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and membrane potential (Vm) of intact endothelial tubes freshly isolated from posterior cerebral arteries of young (4-6 mo), middle-aged (12-16 mo), and old (24-28 mo) male and female C57BL/6 mice. Purinergic receptor function (vs. muscarinic) was dominant and enhanced for [Ca2+]i increases in old females vs. old males. Although, Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel function as defined by NS309-evoked Vm hyperpolarization, was mildly impaired in females vs. males during old age. This sex-based contrast in declined function of GPCRs and K+ channels to produce EDH may support a greater ability for physiological endothelial GPCR function to maintain optimal cerebral blood flow in females vs. males during old age. As reflective of the pattern of cerebral blood flow decline in human subjects, KIR channel function decreased with progressive age regardless of sex. Combined age-related analyses masked male vs. female aging and, contrary to expectation, hydrogen peroxide played a minimal role. Altogether, we conclude a sex-based divergence in cerebrovascular endothelial GPCR and K+ channel function while highlighting a previously unidentified form of age-related endothelial dysfunction as reduced KIR function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Meanwhile, increasing attention is paid to the crucial role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and therapeutic mechanisms of metabolic disorders, especially T2DM. In this study, we used C57 BL/KS db/db male mice as a T2DM murine model. We found that the β-diversity and relative abundances of gut bacteria were obviously altered in db/db mice, associated with a significant increase in Verrucomicrobia at six levels (phylum, class, order, etc.) and family S24-7 and a significant decrease in Bacteroidaceae at family, genus, and species levels, as well as Prevotellaceae at family and genus levels. Furthermore, fecal bacteria from db/db and m/m mice transplanted into pseudo-germ-free mice showed a significant change in the metabolic parameters, including the body weight, fasting blood glucose, fluid and food intake, and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Taken together, these findings suggest that abnormalities in the composition of the gut microbiota might contribute to the development of T2DM and that potential therapeutic strategies improving gut microbiota might provide beneficial effects for individuals with T2DM and age-related glucose intolerance.</AbstractText>"}

Both basins, B1 and B2, have not received vegetation maintenance since construction in 2007. Flow-weighted composite samples were collected during storm events and analyzed for nutrients (Total Phosphorus (TP), Ortho-phosphorus (OP), Ammonia-N (NH<sub>3</sub>), NO<sub>2-3</sub>-N (NO<sub>X</sub>), and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)), total suspended solids (TSS), and total Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. An annual water balance was also conducted to quantify runoff volume reduction.

Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG) is a repeating hexapeptide in the elastin molecule. It is well documented that the peptide sequence binds with high affinity to elastin-binding protein (EBP) located on the cell surface, thereby transducing a molecular signal into the cell. The aim of our study was to investigate whether EBP, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparγ) are involved in VGVAPG-stimulated proliferation. Primary astrocytes were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10 or 1% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of VGVAPG peptide, and resazurin reduction was measured. In addition, Glb1, Pparγ, and Ahr genes were silenced. After 48 h of exposure to 10 nM and 1 µM of VGVAPG peptide, the level of estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) and the expression of Ki67 and S100B proteins were measured. The results showed that at a wide range of concentrations, VGVAPG peptide increased the metabolism of astrocytes depending on the concentration of FBS. After silencing of Glb1, Pparγ, and Ahr genes, VGVAPG peptide did not affect the cell metabolism which suggests the involvement of all the mentioned receptors in its mechanism of action. Interestingly, in the low-FBS medium, the silencing of Glb1 gene did not result in complete inhibition of VGVAPG-stimulated proliferation. On the other hand, in the medium with 10% FBS VGVAPG increased Ki67 expression after Pparγ silencing, whereas in the medium with 1% FBS VGVAPG decreased Ki67 expression. Following the application of Ahr siRNA, VGVAPG peptide decreased the production of E<sub>2</sub> and increased the expression of Ki67 and S100B proteins.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Historically, IPF was considered a chronic inflammatory disorder, which gradually progressed to established fibrosis. However, strong clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the disease represents an epithelial-driven disorder which results from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, aging-associated processes and a profibrotic epigenetic reprogramming. The convergence of these factors results in the aberrant activation of epithelial cells that initiate the development of the disease, producing virtually all the mediators that participate in the migration, proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, their differentiation to myofibroblasts and the excessive and chaotic secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Although progress has been made in understanding the causes and consequences of this abnormal behavior of distal airways and alveolar epithelium, the mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate the vicious circle of multidirectional abnormal communications between the epithelium and fibroblasts and other resident cells have not been elucidated. In this review, we discuss the role of epithelial cells and the mechanisms underlying the fibrotic response in IPF, and highlight some promising therapeutic targets for these cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The proteasome is one of the major intracellular systems involved in the proteolytic degradation of modified proteins but its role in the degradation of glycated proteins is scarcely studied. In this study, chemical and structural changes of glycated myoglobin were analyzed and its degradation by 20S proteasome was studied. Myoglobin was incubated with physiological (5-10 mM), moderate (50-100 mM) and severe levels (300 mM) of glucose or methylglyoxal (MGO, 50 mM). Glycation increased myoglobin's fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity. Severe glycation generated crosslinked proteins as shown by gel electrophoresis. The concentration of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) N-ε-carboxymethyl lysine (CML), N-ε-carboxyethyl lysine (CEL), methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (MG-H1), pentosidine and pyrraline was analyzed after enzymatic hydrolysis followed by UPLC-MS/MS. Higher concentrations of glucose increased all analyzed AGEs and incubation with MGO led to a pronounced increase of CEL and MG-H1. The binding of the heme group to apo-myoglobin was decreased with increasing glycation indicating the loss of tertiary protein structure. Proteasomal degradation of modified myoglobin compared to native myoglobin depends on the degree of glycation: physiological conditions decreased proteasomal degradation whereas moderate glycation increased degradation. Severe glycation again decreased proteolytic cleavage which might be due to crosslinking of protein monomers. The activity of the proteasomal subunit β5 is influenced by the presence of glycated myoglobin. In conclusion, the role of the proteasome in the degradation of glycated proteins is highly dependent on the level of glycation and consequent protein unfolding.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We have thus recalculated the effect sizes and reanalyzed the data using a more robust approach and more sophisticated techniques. Compared to Stanmore's et al., our models show that: (a) the overall effect sizes are substantially smaller; (b) the amount of true heterogeneity, when any, is much lower; and (c) the publication-bias analyses suggest that the actual effect of exergames on overall cognitive function is slim to null.

Increasing evidence suggests that high temperatures could affect various biological traits, including size, longevity, mortality, behavior and metabolism of D. citri. However, the relevant mechanisms of heat stress remain unclear. In this study, a large set of transcriptomic data derived from D. citri adults were generated and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after heat stress were identified by RNA sequencing. A total of 118, 399 unigenes were obtained, from which 37, 665 were mapped to sequences from at least one database. Seven hundreds and twenty-two unigenes were affected by high temperature of 40 °C for 4 h, in which 486 up-regulated and 236 down-regulated, and part of heat shock proteins, antioxidant and detoxification genes and cathepsins were identified as the DEGs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that part of genes involved in protein synthesis and processing, metabolism, immunity, and signal transduction were differentially expressed under heat stress. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of 20 DEGs were confirmed by qRT-PCR, which verified the accuracy of high-throughput sequencing. Our results revealed that the response of D. citri adults to high temperatures is associated with a range of changes involved in various physiological and biochemical processes.

Nine hallmarks have been identified based on their alteration during aging and their capacity to increase longevity. The pathways and the molecular mechanisms to improve lifespan and healthspan are controlled by behavioral, pharmacologic and dietary factors, which remain largely unknown. Among them, naturally occurring compounds, such as polyphenols, are considered potential antiaging agents, because of their ability to modulate some of the evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of aging, including oxidative damage, inflammation, cell senescence, and autophagy. Initially, these compounds gained researchers' attention due to their ability to extend the lifespan of simple model organisms. More recently, some of them have been proposed as senolytic agents to protect against age-related disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The intent of this review is to present the most validated molecular mechanisms regulating ageing and longevity and critically analyze how selected polyphenols, namely resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin and catechins, can interfere with these mechanisms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The sub-lethal effects were investigated by feeding the bacterium directly to adults and larvae of C. agilis or to mealworm beetles (Tenebrio molitor) used as hosts for chrysopids (tritrophic interaction). Direct feeding of B. laterosporus spores to different lacewing larvae instars and to adults did not cause mean mortality levels significantly different from untreated control, and slight though not significant effects of treatments were generally observed on insect longevity, development, fecundity and egg hatching. In the case of lacewing larvae feeding on treated mealworm beetles, adult emergence percentage was reduced approximately 12%, in comparison with untreated control.

Here, by NMR and molecular docking, ATP has been decoded to bind TDP-43 two tandem RRM domains with distinctive types of interactions, thus resulting in diverse affinities. Most strikingly, the binding of ATP enhances thermodynamic stability of TDP-43 RRM domains and inhibits ALS-/AD-associated fibrillation. Together, ATP is a cryptic binder of RRM-containing proteins which generally safeguards functional phase separation from transforming into pathological aggregation/fibrillation associated with various diseases and ageing.

To improve resilience through breeding, we need resilience indicators, which could be based on the fluctuation patterns in milk yield resulting from disturbances. The aim of this study was to explore 3 traits that describe fluctuations in milk yield as indicators for breeding resilient cows: the variance, autocorrelation, and skewness of the deviations from individual lactation curves. We used daily milk yield records of 198,754 first-parity cows, recorded by automatic milking systems. First, we estimated a lactation curve for each cow using 4 different methods: moving average, moving median, quantile regression, and Wilmink curve. We then calculated the log-transformed variance (LnVar), lag-1 autocorrelation (r<sub>auto</sub>), and skewness (Skew) of the daily deviations from these curves as resilience indicators. A genetic analysis of the resilience indicators was performed, and genetic correlations between resilience indicators and health, longevity, fertility, metabolic, and production traits were estimated. The heritabilities differed between LnVar (0.20 to 0.24), r<sub>auto</sub> (0.08 to 0.10), and Skew (0.01 to 0.02), and the genetic correlations among the indicators were weak to moderate. For r<sub>auto</sub> and Skew, genetic correlations with health, longevity, fertility, and metabolic traits were weak or the opposite of what we expected. Therefore, r<sub>auto</sub> and Skew have limited value as resilience indicators. However, lower LnVar was genetically associated with better udder health (genetic correlations from -0.22 to -0.32), better longevity (-0.28 to -0.34), less ketosis (-0.27 to -0.33), better fertility (-0.06 to -0.17), higher BCS (-0.29 to -0.40), and greater dry matter intake (-0.53 to -0.66) at the same level of milk yield. These correlations support LnVar as an indicator of resilience. Of all 4 curve-fitting methods, LnVar based on quantile regression systematically had the strongest genetic correlations with health, longevity, and fertility traits. Thus, quantile regression is considered the best curve-fitting method. In conclusion, LnVar based on deviations from a quantile regression curve is a promising resilience indicator that can be used to breed cows that are better at coping with disturbances.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Wistar rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) β-A<sub>1-42</sub> once, intranasal manganese, naringin and nitric oxide modulators for 21 days and behavioral alterations were assessed. Mitochondrial enzymes, oxidative parameters, TNF-α, β-A<sub>1-42</sub> acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels and manganese concentration were measured. ICV β-A<sub>1-42</sub> and intranasal manganese treated rats showed a memory deficit and significantly increased in β-A<sub>1-42</sub> level and manganese concentration, mitochondrial oxidative damage, AChE level and inflammatory mediator in the hippocampus and cortex. Chronic administration of naringin (40 and 80 mg/kg) significantly improved memory performance and attenuated the oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in Aβ with Mn treated rats. In addition, naringin also attenuates the pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, AChE, Amyloid deposition and Mn concentration. Further, pretreatment of N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) with (5 mg/kg) with lower dose of naringin significantly potentiated its protective effect. These results demonstrate that naringin offers protection against ICV β-A<sub>1-42</sub> and intranasal manganese induced memory dysfunction possibly due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloidogenesis therefore, could have a therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Compared with GLP-1, GIP is less well studied as a hormone or as a potential pharmacological treatment. Beyond its insulinotropic effects in the pancreas, GIP has important biological actions in many other tissues but its role in dietary fat metabolism and lipid storage in adipose tissue has been most studied. It is still unclear if such effects of GIP on adipose tissue/fat metabolism are protective or deleterious in the long term. Antagonising GIP actions through genetic and chemical disruption in mice models prevented diet induced obesity and improved insulin sensitivity. Whilst such effects of GIP antagonism are yet to be evaluated in humans, recent studies using combined GIP and GLP-1 agonists have shown weight reduction and improved glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therapeutic manipulation of GIP physiology is intriguing in that both agonists and antagonists of GIP are being investigated to explore their potential weight-reducing and other metabolic benefits in people with obesity, T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This review will discuss the physiological effects of GIP on fat metabolism in human adipose and other non-adipose tissues such as liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and heart, describe where the actions of GIP may contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity, T2D and NAFLD and finally describe the therapeutic implications of GIP antagonism and agonism in these conditions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Studies on the variability of both evoked brain response and spontaneous brain signals have shown remarkable changes with aging but it is unclear if the different measures of brain signal variability - identified with either hemodynamic or electrophysiological methods - reflect the same underlying physiology. In this study, we aimed to explore age differences of spontaneous brain signal variability with two different imaging modalities (EEG, fMRI) in healthy younger (25 ​± ​3 years, N ​= ​135) and older (67 ​± ​4 years, N ​= ​54) adults. Consistent with the previous studies, we found lower blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) variability in the older subjects as well as less signal variability in the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (1-12 ​Hz), measured in source space. These age-related reductions were mostly observed in the areas that overlap with the default mode network. Moreover, age-related increases of variability in the amplitude of beta-band frequency EEG oscillations (15-25 ​Hz) were seen predominantly in temporal brain regions. There were significant sex differences in EEG signal variability in various brain regions while no significant sex differences were observed in BOLD signal variability. Bivariate and multivariate correlation analyses revealed no significant associations between EEG- and fMRI-based variability measures. In summary, we show that both BOLD and EEG signal variability reflect aging-related processes but are likely to be dominated by different physiological origins, which relate differentially to age and sex.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The fundamental parameter governing this process is p, or the probability of CFU-s self-renewing. Previously, when CFU-s growth was modeled by Monte Carlo simulations, p was kept constant during the 20 cell cycles required for the modeling. However, it is known that CFU-s self-renewal undergoes decline with proliferation. In the present study, this was taken into consideration, such that p was forced to undergo a small decline with each cell division. These new Monte Carlo calculations give an improved fit to CFU-s cumulative growth curves as compared with those calculations using fixed p. This new model, referred to as the variable p model, offers an explanation as to how large mammals can amplify marrow output from stem cell compartments that are no larger than those found in small mammals. It is a model in which small changes in active stem cell aging generate disproportionally large increases in the size of active stem cell clones.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Oxidation of tryptophan (Trp) residues of a major γ-crystallin namely human γD-crystallin (HGD) was found to be inhibited by a naturally occurring flavonoid hesperetin at relatively low concentration mostly due to its antioxidant activity. Further the molecular interactions between HGD and hesperetin were elucidated on the basis of the quenching of Trp fluorescence of the protein by the flavonoid. Ground state complexation between HGD and hesperetin caused static quenching of the Trp fluorescence of HGD. Binding and quenching constants were in the order of (10<sup>3</sup>- 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>). Energy transfer from protein to hesperetin was suggested by FRET calculations. Thermodynamic parameters reveal significant hydrophobic association between the protein and hesperetin.

However, their presence in adult solid organs such as heart in humans has not been established. VSELs are valuable source of stem cells for tissue regeneration and replacement of cells for turnover and usual wear-and-tear. The purpose of our study was to explore the existence of human VSELs (huVSELs) in human heart tissue and examine the changes in their prevalence with aging and cardiac disease. Human heart tissue, collected from healthy and ischemic heart disease subjects was examined for the prevalence of VSELS, defined as CD45-/CD133+/SSEA4+. Both epicardial and endocardial tissues were examined comparing VSEL numbers across different age groups. Our data confirm the existence of huVSELs in adult hearts with decreasing prevalence during aging. This is the first evidence of huVSELs in adult cardiac tissue.

A closed-loop disease management system is an ideal solution for such patients. An example of this is an artificial pancreas for diabetes management. For safe and effective closed-loop disease management, the cost, size, longevity, warm-up time, and response speed need to match the performance of a healthy biological system (e.g. the pancreas). In this paper, a novel needle-injectable mm-size wireless sensing platform is presented to fulfill these requirements for an artificial pancreas by combining advanced microelectronics, nanotechnology and advanced biomaterial science. The proposed platform utilizes a sensor that is smaller than a sesame seed and provides fundamental advantages in terms of fast response speed, high accuracy, short warm-up time, and low cost of goods. Owing to these features, the system will enable true closed-loop glucose control (without any meal announcements and carbohydrate calculations), especially among infants and toddlers.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs in diabetic bone remains to be fully elucidated. We hypothesized that elevated glucose and glucose variation would affect the function of osteocytes, essential regulators of bone homeostasis and quality. To first test this hypothesis, we used the IDG-SW3 osteocyte-like cell line to examine the effects of glucose levels on osteocyte function and viability in vitro. We confirmed our in vitro findings using the in vivo streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic rat model and ex-vivo cultured osteocytes from these rats. IDG-SW3 cells cultured under high glucose conditions displayed significantly increased Sost mRNA(100-fold) and sclerostin protein, a negative regulator of bone formation(5000-fold), compared to cells in control media. mRNA expression of osteoblast markers such as Osx, Ocn and Col1a1 was unaffected by glucose. Factors associated with osteoclast activation were affected by glucose, with Rankl being upregulated by low glucose. Opg was also transiently upregulated by high glucose in mature IDG-SW3 cells. Induction of diabetes in Sprague-Dawley rats via a single dose of STZ (70 mg/kg) resulted in elevated maximum glucose and increased variability compared to control animals (670/796 vs. 102/142 mg/dL). This was accompanied by increased Sost/sclerostin expression in the osteocytes of these animals. These results show that glucose levels directly regulate osteocyte function through sclerostin expression and suggest a potential mechanism for the negative impact of diabetes on bone quality.</AbstractText>"}

Folic acid (FA) has been reported to improve cognitive performance in mild cognitive impairment; however, its association with telomere remains unclear. The study aimed to investigate if alleviation of telomere attrition by FA supplementation could act as a potential mechanism to delay age-related cognitive decline in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). Aged SAMP8 mice were assigned to four treatment groups: FAdeficient diet (FA-D) group, FA-normal diet (FA-N) group, low FA-supplemented diet (FA-L) group and high FAsupplemented diet (FA-H) group. There was also an age-matched senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) control group (Con-R), and a young SAMP8 control group (Con-Y). The results demonstrated that FA supplementation delayed age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in SAMP8 mice. Importantly, this effect could be attributed to the alleviated telomere attrition, which might be interpreted by the decreased levels of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, improved telomere integrity stimulated mitochondrial function via telomere-p53-mithondria pathway, consequently delayed neuronal degeneration. In conclusion, we demonstrate that FA supplementation delays age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in SAMP8 mice, in which alleviated telomere attrition could serve as one influential factor in the process.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we further investigated the effects of a rotating magnetic field (RMF; 0.2 T, 4 Hz) on the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The results showed that RMF exposure prolonged the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> and slowed the aging of HUVECs. RMF treatment of HUVECs showed that activation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) due to increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress in anti-aging mechanisms. RMF also promoted the health status of <i>C. elegans</i> by improving activity, reducing age-related pigment accumulation, delaying Aβ-induced paralysis and increasing resistance to heat and oxidative stress. The prolonged lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> was associated with decreased levels of daf-16 which related to the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas the heat shock transcription factor-1 (hsf-1) pathway was not involved. Moreover, the level of autophagy was increased after RMF treatment. These findings expand our understanding of the potential mechanisms by which RMF treatment prolongs lifespan.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of our project was to identify changes in the expression and function of transport proteins in the astrocytic membrane and properties of the extracellular space, triggered by aging. We used three-dimensional confocal morphometry, gene expression profiling, immunohistochemical analysis, and diffusion measurement in the hippocampal slices from 3-, 9-, 12-, and 18-month-old mice, in which astrocytes are visualized by enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the promoter for human glial fibrillary acidic protein. Combining a pharmacological approach and the quantification of astrocyte volume changes evoked by hyperkalemia, we found that marked diversity in the extent of astrocyte swelling in the hippocampus during aging is due to the gradually declining participation of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> transporters, glutamate transporters (glutamate aspartate transporter and glutamate transporter 1), and volume-regulated anion channels. Interestingly, there was a redistribution of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter and glutamate transporters from astrocytic soma to processes. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed an age-dependent decrease in the content of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter in astrocytes. The overall extracellular volume changes revealed a similar age-dependent diversity during hyperkalemia as observed in astrocytes. In addition, the recovery of the extracellular space was markedly impaired in aged animals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To be considered useful, any functional measure needs to provide pertinent information on the patient and predict relevant outcomes such as health-care utilization (e.g., length of stay (LOS)) and patient-reported quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study was to determine if HGS predicted LOS and QOL.

During the aging process, a gradual loss of bone mass results in osteopenia and osteoporosis. Heritable factors account for 60%-80% of optimal bone mineralization, whereas modifiable factors such as nutrition, weight-bearing exercise, body mass, and hormonal milieu affect the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis in adulthood. Osteoporosis substantially increases the risk of skeletal fractures and further morbidity and mortality. The effective prevention of fractures by reducing the loss of bone mass is the primary goal for physicians treating people with osteoporosis. Other than pharmacologic agents, lifestyle adjustment, nutritional support, fall prevention strategies, exercise, and physical modalities can be used to treat osteoporosis or prevent further osteoporotic fracture. Each of these factors, alone or in combination, can be of benefit to people with osteoporosis and should be implemented following a detailed discussion with patients. This review comprises a systematic survey of the current literature on osteoporosis and its nonpharmacologic and nonsurgical treatment. It provides clinicians and healthcare workers with evidence-based information on the assessment and management of osteoporosis. However, numerous issues regarding osteoporosis and its treatment remain unexplored and warrant future investigation.</AbstractText>"}

Fourteen healthcare providers and 64 patients 18 years or older with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 and access to the Internet were recruited for this 12-week feasibility study. Patient participants logged meals and exercise into the GM application via smart phone, tablet, or computer and virtually engaged with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) in one-on-one sessions. The primary endpoint was to examine feasibility of the program by usage of the application and feedback questions regarding the benefits and challenges of the application. Participants were predominately white (92%) and female (76%). Minimal improvements in weight and systolic blood pressure were found. Participant attitude survey data declined from 4-weeks to 12-weeks of the intervention. Interestingly though, patients in a rural clinic had lesser declines in attitudes than peri-urban participants. Qualitative feedback data identified participants predominately had a positive overall feeling toward the approach. Participants expressed favorability of RDN access, the variety of foods, but did give suggestions for in-person meetings and more updating of the application. Implementing a technology approach to nutrition in rural areas of West Virginia using a mobile application with RDN access may be one strategy to address public health issues such as obesity.</AbstractText>"}

In the as-cast alloy, the compound phases segregated along the interdendritic interfaces within the interiors of original grains provided the additional sites for continuous dynamic recrystallization via the particle stimulation nucleation mechanism. As a result, the as-cast alloy exhibited higher fractions of recrystallized grains and smaller grain sizes than the extruded alloy after compression. The stress exponent values of the as-cast alloy were smaller than those of the extruded alloy. In the processing maps, the domain associated with high power dissipation efficiencies (≥35%) occurred in a wider temperature range in the as-cast alloy compared to the extruded alloy. The segregated phases that remained undissolved in the as-cast alloy after compressive deformation could be effectively eliminated during the solid solution treatment (753 K for 2 h) for T6 aging applied after hot compression. The current results suggest the possibility and advantage of omitting the extrusion step when preparing 7xxx aluminum forging or extrusion feedstocks for hot working. The proposed method can be applied to other precipitation hardenable aluminum alloys.</AbstractText>"}

This study aims to evaluate the flow-induced crystallization of bio-asphalt modified with different contents of biochar under various aging conditions. Small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamic simulations were performed to impose extensional deformation and the nucleation process. The rheological properties were measured using the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and the morphology of biochar modified bio-asphalt (BMBA) was measured using an optical microscope. The relative scattering intensity during crystallization appeared to peak at four strain rates: 13.2 s<sup>-1</sup>, 19.6 s<sup>-1</sup>, 25.4 s<sup>-1</sup>, and 27.3 s<sup>-1</sup>. The results showed that the addition of biochar could improve the flow-induced crystallization and enhance the high-temperature properties of bio-asphalt. Moreover, crystallization status of BMBA is lamellar crystals. Ultraviolet and pressure aging vessel aging could remarkably affect the crystallization status of BMBA and promote the formation of crystals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study examined how DOM source and transformation processes (microbial and photochemical) affect its chemical composition and phytotoxicity towards a cultured species of cyanobacteria (Raphidiopsis raciborskii) using a factorial experimental design. To complement cyanobacterial bioassays, the chemical composition and associated changes in DOM were determined using spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and absorbance) and elemental analyses. Sunlight exposed DOM from leaves of the terrestrial plants, Casuarina cunninghamiana and Eucalyptus tereticornis had the most phytotoxic effect compared to DOM not exposed to sunlight. This phytotoxic DOM was characterised by relatively low nitrogen content, containing highly coloured and relatively high molecular mass constituents. Both mixed effect model and PCA approaches to predict inhibition of photosynthetic yield indicated phytotoxicity could be predicted (P &lt; 0.001) based upon the following parameters: C: N ratio; gilvin, and lignin-derived phenol content of DOM. Parallel proton-detected 1D and 2D NMR techniques showed that glucose anomers were the major constituents of fresh leachate. With ageing, glucose anomers disappeared and products of microbial transformation appeared, but there was no indication of the appearance of additional phytotoxic compounds. This suggests that reactive oxygen species may be responsible, at least partially, for DOM phytotoxicity. This study provides important new information highlighting the characteristics of DOM that link with phytotoxic effects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite considerable advances in explaining successful fish invasions, little is known about how non-native fish successfully invade alpine freshwater ecosystems. Here, we explore the role of fish life history and environmental factors in contributing to invasion success of Pseudorasbora parva on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We compared life history trait differences between native populations in lowland China with introduced populations in lowland Europe and the high elevation Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse life-history trait variation across elevation gradients. A random forest model was developed to identify the key environmental filters influencing P. parva invasion success. Life history characteristics differed substantially between native and introduced populations. Compared with native Chinese populations, introduced populations in lowland Europe had smaller body size, higher fecundity, smaller oocytes and earlier maturation. Introduced populations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had smaller body size, lower fecundity, smaller oocytes and later maturation compared with native populations. 1-Year-Length and fecundity in all age classes of females significantly increased with increasing elevation. 2-Year-Length and 3-Year-Length of male significantly increased while maximal longevity and length at first maturity were significantly decreased with the elevation gradient. Habitat type, annual mean temperature, elevation, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality, were the 5 most important predictors for the occurrence of the P. parva. Our study indicates that invasive P. parva adopt different life history strategies on the plateau compared with invasive populations at low elevations, highlighting that more studies are required for a better understanding of biological invasion under extreme conditions. Considering the ongoing hydrologic alteration and climate change, our study also highlighted that P. parva may expand their distribution range in the future on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Delirium develops over a short period of time and predominantly relates to an underlying medical condition. It is significantly under-recognised in the older adults who present to acute medical services and in those living within a care home setting. Up to 30% of older adults who present via the Emergency Department may be experiencing signs and symptoms of delirium, with up to 33% of older adults within the care home setting also experiencing delirium. In both settings the delirium may go unrecognised and be incorrectly considered as a deterioration of an existing dementia. Nurses and care staff in the care home setting, spend more time with older adults than any member of the multi-disciplinary team e.g. GP, physiotherapist, district nurse etc. and as such, their knowledge and skills in the recognition and early intervention when delirium is present can have a significant impact on the outcome for the older adult. Using a Freedom of Information request (Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act, 2002), a legal process designed to elicit transparency and guarantee a response, the authors invited responses from Scottish universities, to enable a review of the current approach in the teaching of delirium to undergraduate nursing students. At the outset, the authors were interested to establish the extent to which delirium featured in the nursing undergraduate programme in Scotland. Having established that the approach to teaching was highly variable, this paper poses the question whether more structured focus should be given to the topic within the undergraduate nursing curriculum.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than 100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.</AbstractText>"}

However, the existing biological age prediction models based on DNA methylation are predominantly adult-oriented. We established a methylation-based age prediction model for children (9-212 months old) using data from 716 blood samples in 11 DNA methylation datasets. Our elastic net model includes 111 CpG sites, mostly in genes associated with development and aging. The model performed well and exhibited high precision, yielding a 98% correlation between the DNA methylation age and the chronological age, with an error of only 6.7 months. When we used the model to assess age acceleration in children based on their methylation data, we observed the following: first, the aging rate appears to be fastest in mid-childhood, and this acceleration is more pronounced in autistic children; second, lead exposure early in life increases the aging rate in boys, but not in girls; third, short-term recombinant human growth hormone treatment has little effect on the aging rate of children. Our child-specific methylation-based age prediction model can effectively detect epigenetic changes and health imbalances early in life. This may thus be a useful model for future studies of epigenetic interventions for age-related diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Direct Sanger sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that circ_0006332 was significantly upregulated in bladder cancer tissues. Sequencing analysis showed that circ_0006332 is generated from splicing of exons 8 and 9 of the <i>MYBL2</i> transcript. Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis showed that circ_0006332 was localized to the cytoplasm of bladder cancer cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-143 specifically bound to circ_0006332 and the 3'UTR of MYBL2. High expression of circ_006332 correlated with tumor-node-metastasis stages and muscular invasion in bladder cancer patients. Knockdown of circ_0006332 in bladder cancer cells decreased proliferation, colony formation and invasiveness. Circ_0006332 knockdown increased E-cadherin levels and decreased Vimentin, CCNB1 and P21 protein expression. This suggests that circ_0006332 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell cycle progression. <i>In vivo</i> experiments in nude mice showed that circ_0006332 knockdown bladder cancer cells form significantly smaller tumors than the controls. Our study demonstrates that circ_0006332 promotes the growth and progression of bladder cancer by modulating MYBL2 expression by acting as a sponge for miR-143.

Structural brain difference has shown the potential in cognitive related diagnosis, however cortical thickness patterns transferred from aMCI to AD, especially in the subtypes of aMCI, is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the cortical thickness discrepancies among AD, aMCI and normal control (NC) entities, especially for two subtypes of aMCI - multiple-domain aMCI (aMCI-m) and single-domain aMCI (aMCI-s). Both region of interest (ROI)-based and vertex-based statistical strategies were performed for group-level cortical thickness comparison. Spearman correlation was utilized to identify the correlation between cortical thickness and clinical neuropsychological scores. The result demonstrated that there was a significant cortical thickness decreasing tendency in fusiform gyrus from NC to aMCI-s to aMCI-m to finally AD in both left and right hemispheres. Meanwhile, the two subtypes of aMCI showed cortical thickness difference in middle temporal gyrus in left hemisphere. Spearman correlation indicated that neuropsychological scores had significant correlations with entorhinal, inferior temporal and middle temporal gyrus. The findings suggested that cortical thickness might serve as a potential imaging biomarker for the differential diagnosis of cognitive impairment.</AbstractText>"}

This decrease in mHR is independent of gender, fitness, and lifestyle, affecting in equal measure women and men, athletes and couch potatoes, spinach eaters and fast food enthusiasts. Importantly, the decline in mHR is the major determinant of the age-dependent decline in aerobic capacity that ultimately limits functional independence for many older individuals. The gradual reduction in mHR with age reflects a slowing of the intrinsic pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial node of the heart, which results from electrical remodeling of individual pacemaker cells along with structural remodeling and a blunted β-adrenergic response. In this review, we summarize current evidence about the tissue, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that underlie the reduction in pacemaker activity with age and highlight key areas for future work.

Multiple genes have been shown to contribute to the risk of Parkinson's disease, and currently 90 independent risk variants have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Thus far, a number of genes (including SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA) have been shown to contain variability across a spectrum of frequency and effect, from rare, highly penetrant variants to common risk alleles with small effect sizes. Variants in GBA, encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are associated with Lewy body diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. These variants, which reduce or abolish enzymatic activity, confer a spectrum of disease risk, from 1.4- to &gt;10-fold. An outstanding question in the field is what other genetic factors that influence GBA-associated risk for disease, and whether these overlap with known Parkinson's disease risk variants. Using multiple, large case-control datasets, totalling 217 165 individuals (22 757 Parkinson's disease cases, 13 431 Parkinson's disease proxy cases, 622 Lewy body dementia cases and 180 355 controls), we identified 1691 Parkinson's disease cases, 81 Lewy body dementia cases, 711 proxy cases and 7624 controls with a GBA variant (p.E326K, p.T369M or p.N370S). We performed a genome-wide association study and analysed the most recent Parkinson's disease-associated genetic risk score to detect genetic influences on GBA risk and age at onset. We attempted to replicate our findings in two independent datasets, including the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc. and whole-genome sequencing data. Our analysis showed that the overall Parkinson's disease genetic risk score modifies risk for disease and decreases age at onset in carriers of GBA variants. Notably, this effect was consistent across all tested GBA risk variants. Dissecting this signal demonstrated that variants in close proximity to SNCA and CTSB (encoding cathepsin B) are the most significant contributors. Risk variants in the CTSB locus were identified to decrease mRNA expression of CTSB. Additional analyses suggest a possible genetic interaction between GBA and CTSB and GBA p.N370S induced pluripotent cell-derived neurons were shown to have decreased cathepsin B expression compared to controls. These data provide a genetic basis for modification of GBA-associated Parkinson's disease risk and age at onset, although the total contribution of common genetics variants is not large. We further demonstrate that common variability at genes implicated in lysosomal function exerts the largest effect on GBA associated risk for disease. Further, these results have implications for selection of GBA carriers for therapeutic interventions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain 2019.

In contrast, <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes from outbred laboratory stocks develop fully regardless of maternal age. Since mature <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes are not extensively stored in the ovary under laboratory conditions like they are in the wild, we developed a system to investigate how storage affects oocyte quality. The developmental capacity of stored mature Drosophila oocytes decays in a precise manner over 14 days at 25°C. These oocytes are transcriptionally inactive and persist using ongoing translation of stored mRNAs. Ribosome profiling revealed a progressive 2.3-fold decline in average translational efficiency during storage that correlates with oocyte functional decay. Although normal bipolar meiotic spindles predominate during the first week, oocytes stored for longer periods increasingly show tripolar, monopolar and other spindle defects, and give rise to embryos that fail to develop due to aneuploidy. Thus, meiotic chromosome segregation in mature <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes is uniquely sensitive to prolonged storage. Our work suggests the chromosome instability of human embryos could be mitigated by reducing the period of time mature human oocytes are stored in the ovary prior to ovulation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, Greenblatt et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the colon, MHT appears to act through estrogen receptor β (ERβ) which may influence DNA methylation by binding to DNA. Using genome-wide methylation profiling data, we aimed to identify genes that may be differentially methylated according to MHT use. <b>Materials &amp; methods:</b> DNA methylation was measured using Illumina HumanMethylation450k arrays in two independent tumor sample sets of colorectal cancer patients. Differential methylation was determined using R/limma. <b>Results:</b> In the discovery analysis, two CpG sites showed differential DNA methylation according to MHT use, both were not replicated. In stratified analyses, 342 CpG sites were associated with current MHT use only in ERβ-positive tumors. <b>Conclusion:</b> The suggestive findings of differential methylation according to current MHT use in ERβ-positive tumors warrant further investigation.</AbstractText>"}

To address this, the current authors propose Engaging with Aging (EWA), a perspective and set of processes older adults can use to approach daily living in a reasoned, purposeful manner that has similarities with clinical reasoning. EWA, a person-centered approach, can be considered citizen science in that it was developed by a nonagenarian based on personal experiences. Research using the EWA framework has the potential to advance the science of how older adults can manage and adapt to the impact of age-related changes to maintain independence and life satisfaction, and ultimately contribute to the development of care strategies.

Unfortunately, the optimum properties of TlBr quickly decay when an operating electrical field is applied. Quantum mechanical studies indicated that if this property degradation comes from the conventional mechanism of ionic migration of vacancies, then an unrealistically high vacancy concentration is required to account for the rapid aging of TlBr seen in experiments. In this work, we have applied large scale molecular dynamics simulations to study the effects of dislocations on ionic migration of TlBr crystals under electrical fields. We found that electrical fields can drive the motion of edge dislocations in both slip and climb directions. These combined motions eject enormous vacancies in the dislocation trail. Both dislocation motion and a high vacancy concentration can account for the rapid aging of the TlBr detectors. These findings suggest that strengthening methods to pin dislocations should be explored to increase the lifetimes of TlBr crystals.</AbstractText>"}

We found that TRP canonical 7 (TRPC7) is a nociceptive mechanoreceptor and that TRPC7 channels specifically mediate the initiation of ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced skin aging and tumor development due to p53 gene family mutations. Within 30 min after UVB irradiation, TRPC7 mediated UVB-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species in skin cells. Notably, this function was unique to TRPC7 and was not observed for other TRP channels. In TRPC7 knockout mice, we did not observe the significant UVB-associated pathology seen in wild-type mice, including epidermal thickening, abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, and DNA damage response activation. TRPC7 knockout mice also had significantly fewer UVB-induced cancerous tumors than did wild-type mice, and UVB-induced p53 gene family mutations were prevented in TRPC7 knockout mice. These results indicate that TRPC7 activity is pivotal in the initiation of UVB-induced skin aging and tumorigenesis and that the reduction in TRPC7 activity suppresses the UVB-induced aging process and tumor development. Our findings support that TRPC7 is a potential tumor initiator gene and that it causes cell aging and genomic instability, followed by a change in the activity of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to promote tumorigenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Old mice (26-28 months) received daily intraperitoneal injections of recombinant human IL-37 (recIL-37; 1 µg/200 ml PBS) or vehicle (200 ml PBS) for 10-14 days. Vascular endothelial function (ex vivo carotid artery dilation to increasing doses of acetylcholine, ACh) was enhanced in recIL-37 vs. vehicle-treated mice via increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability (all p &lt; .05); this effect was accompanied by enhanced ACh-stimulated NO production and reduced levels of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells cultured with plasma from IL-37-treated animals (p &lt; .05 vs. vehicle plasma). RecIL-37 treatment increased endurance exercise capacity by 2.4-fold, which was accompanied by a 2.9-fold increase in the phosphorylated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) to AMPK ratio (i.e., AMPK activation) in quadriceps muscle. RecIL-37 treatment also improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (p &lt; .05 vs. vehicle). Improvements in physiological function occurred without significant changes in plasma, aortic, and skeletal muscle pro-inflammatory proteins (under resting conditions), whereas pro-/anti-inflammatory IL-6 was greater in recIL-37-treated animals. Plasma metabolomics analysis revealed that recIL-37 treatment altered metabolites related to pathways involved in NO synthesis (e.g., increased L-arginine and citrulline/arginine ratio) and fatty acid metabolism (e.g., increased pantothenol and free fatty acids). Our findings provide experimental support for IL-37 therapy as a novel strategy to improve diverse physiological functions in old age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

This disease is caused by a 2.5- to 3.8-kb-long complex pentanucleotide repeat containing (TGGAA)<sub>n</sub>, (TAGAA)<sub>n</sub>, (TAAAA)<sub>n</sub>, and (TAAAATAGAA)<sub>n</sub> in an intron of the gene called BEAN1 (brain expressed, associated with Nedd4). By comparing various pentanucleotide repeats in this particular locus among control Japanese and Caucasian populations, it was found that (TGGAA)<sub>n</sub> was the only sequence segregating with SCA31, strongly suggesting the pathogenicity of (TGGAA)<sub>n</sub>. The complex repeat also lies in an intron of another gene, TK2 (thymidine kinase 2), which is transcribed in the opposite direction, indicating that the complex repeat is bi-directionally transcribed as noncoding repeats. In SCA31 human brains, (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub>, the BEAN1 transcript of SCA31 mutation was found to form abnormal RNA structures called RNA foci in cerebellar Purkinje cell nuclei. Subsequent RNA pulldown analysis disclosed that (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub> binds to RNA-binding proteins TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNP A2/B1. In fact, TDP-43 was found to co-localize with RNA foci in human SCA31 Purkinje cells. To dissect the pathogenesis of (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub> in SCA31, we generated transgenic fly models of SCA31 by overexpressing SCA31 complex pentanucleotide repeats in Drosophila. We found that the toxicity of (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub> is length- and expression level-dependent, and it was dampened by co-expressing TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNP A2/B1. Further investigation revealed that TDP-43 ameliorates (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub> toxicity by directly fixing the abnormal structure of (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub>. This led us to propose that TDP-43 acts as an RNA chaperone against toxic (UGGAA)<sub>n</sub>. Further research on the role of RNA-binding proteins as RNA chaperones may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for SCA31.</AbstractText>"}

Fitting GLMMs in very large cohorts, however, can be computationally demanding. Also, the modified versions of GLMM using faster algorithms may underperform, for instance when a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is correlated with fixed-effects covariates. We investigated the extent to which disregarding family structure may compromise GWAS in cohorts with simple pedigrees by contrasting logistic regression models (i.e., with no family structure) to three LMMs-based ones. Our analyses showed that the logistic regression models in general resulted in smaller P values compared with the LMMs-based models; however, the differences in P values were mostly minor. Disregarding family structure had little impact on determining disease-associated SNPs at genome-wide level of significance (i.e., P &lt; 5E-08) as the four P values resulted from the tested methods for any SNP were all below or all above 5E-08. Nevertheless, larger discrepancies were detected between logistic regression and LMMs-based models at suggestive level of significance (i.e., of 5E-08 ≤ P &lt; 5E-06). The SNP effects estimated by the logistic regression models were not statistically different from those estimated by GLMMs that implemented Wald's test. However, several SNP effects were significantly different from their counterparts in LMMs analyses. We suggest that fitting GLMMs with Wald's test on a pre-selected subset of SNPs obtained from logistic regression models can ensure the balance between the speed of analyses and the accuracy of parameters.</AbstractText>"}

The etiology of menopausal acne is multifactorial, with hormonal imbalance being the major culprit. There is a relative increase of androgens in the menopausal female that leads to clinical hyperandrogenism manifesting as acne, hirsutism and androgenetic alopecia. Other endocrine disorders including thyroid abnormalities, hyperprolactinemia and insulin resistance also play a role. Genetics, stress, dietary changes, lack of sleep and exercise and other lifestyle changes are implicated as trigger factors. Most menopausal women with isolated few acne lesions have normoandrogenic serum levels and do not require extensive investigations. However, baseline investigations including total testosterone are useful. Patients must also be evaluated for associated comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. A detailed history can help to exclude polycystic ovarian syndrome, late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia or medications as a cause of acne. The evaluation of menopausal acne and the approach to treatment depend on the severity of acne and associated features. In patients with mild acne without virilization, prolonged topical therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Though combined oral contraceptives are effective, they are relatively contraindicated in the postmenopausal period. Spironolactone is the first choice of therapy in the subset of patients that require oral anti-androgen therapy. Procedural treatment can be useful as it can also help in the treatment of associated acne scars and concomitant skin aging. It is also important to focus on lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, controlling obesity, having a healthy diet, exercise and proper skin care routine to reduce acne. The focus of this article is on the clinical presentation and management challenges of menopausal acne, which represents a special subtype of acne.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Khunger and Mehrotra.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This aging process is often connected with cognitive decline of some functions such as memory or speed processing loss. Since Alzheimer's disease cannot be cured yet, considerable efforts are being made to at least delay this cognitive decline among elderly in order to maintain and prolong the quality of their life. This can also be achieved by non-pharmacological approaches such as performing physical activities, cognitive training, or adhering to a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). One of the components of MedDiet - extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) - has considerable health benefits. The purpose of this review is to examine the effect of EVOO intake on the delay of cognitive decline among the elderly. The methodology is based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in three acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the regular intake of EVOO is associated with enhanced cognitive functions, which means that this oil may have a neuroprotective effect and could positively prevent the development of dementia, especially Alzheimer's dementia. It is believed that secoiridoid oleuropein is responsible for this effectiveness. Furthermore, there is also a need of more randomized controlled studies or longitudinal observational studies to be performed to confirm the efficacy of the beneficial health effect of EVOO on the delay of cognitive decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Klimova et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4) is a member of ING family while its cellular functions remain controversial. Here, we identified several nucleolar proteins as novel ING4 interacting proteins. ING4 localized in the nucleus with strong accumulation in the nucleolus through its plant homeodomain, which is known to interact with histone trimethylated H3K4, commonly present in the promoter of active genes. ING4 deficient cells exhibited slower proliferation and the alteration in nucleolar structure with reduced rRNA transcription, which was rescued by exogenous expression of GFP-ING4 to the similar levels of wild type cells. In the ING4 deficient cells, histone H3K9 acetylation and the key rRNA transcription factor UBF at the promoter of rDNA were reduced, both of which were also recovered by exogenous GFP-ING4 expression. Thus, ING4 could positively regulate rRNA transcription through modulation of histone modifications at the rDNA promoter.</AbstractText>"}

Gait is potentially a useful biomarker to help discriminate PD at an early stage, however the optimal characteristics and combination are unclear. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) techniques to determine the optimal combination of gait characteristics to discriminate people with PD and healthy controls (HC). 303 participants (119 PD, 184 HC) walked continuously around a circuit for 2-minutes at a self-paced walk. Gait was quantified using an instrumented mat (GAITRite) from which 16 gait characteristics were derived and assessed. Gait characteristics were selected using different ML approaches to determine the optimal method (random forest with information gain and recursive features elimination (RFE) technique with support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression). Five clinical gait characteristics were identified with RFE-SVM (mean step velocity, mean step length, step length variability, mean step width, and step width variability) that accurately classified PD. Model accuracy for classification of early PD ranged between 73-97% with 63-100% sensitivity and 79-94% specificity. In conclusion, we identified a subset of gait characteristics for accurate early classification of PD. These findings pave the way for a better understanding of the utility of ML techniques to support informed clinical decision-making.</AbstractText>"}

The treatment also suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in dogs and mouse models. Here we investigated some mechanistic aspects of these effects. In mammary tumors bearing-dogs, i.m. injections of p62 plasmid reduced tumor sizes and their aggressive potential in 5 out of 6 animals, with one carcinoma switching to adenoma. The treatment increased levels of smooth muscle actin in stroma cells and type III collagen in the extracellular matrix, which correlate with a good clinical prognosis. The p62 treatment also increased the abundance of intratumoral T-cells. Because of the role of adaptive immunity cannot be tested in dogs, we compared the protective effects of the p62 plasmid against B16 melanoma in wild type C57BL/6J mice versus their SCID counterpart lacking lymphocytes. The plasmid was only protective in the wild type strain. Also, p62 plasmid amplified the anti-tumor effect of T-cell transfer from tumor-bearing animals to animals challenged with the same tumors. We conclude that the plasmid acts via re-modeling of the tumor microenvironment, making it more favorable for increased anti-cancer immunity.

We have identified a spontaneous mutant mouse line, small with kinky tail (<i>skt</i>), that exhibits accelerated aging and age-related disease phenotypes including increased inflammation in the brain and retina, enhanced age-dependent retinal abnormalities including photoreceptor cell degeneration, neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, and reduced lifespan. By positional cloning, we identified a deletion in chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (<i>Chsy1</i>) that is responsible for these phenotypes in <i>skt</i> mice. CHSY1 is a member of the chondroitin N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family that plays critical roles in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is attached to the core protein to form the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). Consistent with this function, the <i>Chsy1</i> mutation dramatically decreases chondroitin sulfate GAGs in the retina and hippocampus. In addition, macrophage and neutrophil populations appear significantly altered in the bone marrow and spleen of <i>skt</i> mice, suggesting an important role for CHSY1 in the functioning of these immune cell types. Thus, our study reveals a previously unidentified impact of CHSY1 in the retina and hippocampus. Specifically, chondroitin sulfate (CS) modification of proteins by CHSY1 appears critical for proper regulation of immune cells of the myeloid lineage and for maintaining the integrity of neuronal tissues, since a defect in this gene results in increased inflammation and abnormal phenotypes associated with age-related diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 by the Genetics Society of America.</CopyrightInformation>"}

{"PMID":31754011,"Title":"CCB is involved in actin-based axonal transport of selected synaptic proteins.","Journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Date":"Nov 21 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Synapse formation, maturation, and turnover require a finely regulated transport system that delivers selected cargos to specific synapses. However, the supporting mechanisms of this process are not fully understood. The present study unravels a new molecular system for vesicle-based axonal transport of proteins in male and female flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>). Here, we identify the gene CG14579 as the transcription unit corresponding to the regulatory mutations known as <i>central complex broad</i>, <i>ccb</i> These mutations were previously isolated for their morphological phenotype in R-neurons of the ellipsoid body, a component of the central complex. Mutant axons from R-neurons fail to cross the midline, which is indicative of an aberrant composition of the growth cone. However, the molecular mechanism remained to be deciphered. In this manuscript, we show that CCB is involved in axonal trafficking of FasII and Synaptobrevin, but not Syntaxin. These results suggest that axonal transport of certain proteins is required for the correct pathfinding of R-neurons. We further investigated the molecular network supporting the CCB system and found that CCB co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with Rab11. Epistasis studies indicated that Rab11 is positioned downstream of CCB within this axonal transport system. Interestingly, <i>ccb</i> also interacts with Actin and the Actin nucleator <i>spire</i> The data revealed that this interaction plays a key role in the development of axonal connections within the ellipsoid body. We propose that the CCB/Rab11/SPIRE system regulates axonal trafficking of synaptic proteins required for proper connectivity and synaptic function.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>Proper function of the nervous system requires the establishment of mature, functional synapses. Differential protein composition in the synapse enables optimal performance of cognitive tasks. Therefore, it is critical to have a finely regulated transport system to deliver selected synaptic proteins to synapses. Remarkably, impairments in cytoskeleton-based protein-transport systems often underlie cognitive deficits, such as those associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This study reveals that CCB is part of a novel transport system that delivers certain synaptic proteins via the actin cytoskeleton within the Rab11-related domain of slow recycling endosomes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Individual myofibers that make up muscle tissue exhibit variation in their metabolic and contractile properties. Although biochemical and histological assays are available to study myofiber heterogeneity, efficient methods to analyze the whole transcriptome of individual myofibers are lacking. Here, we report on a single-myofiber RNA-sequencing (smfRNA-Seq) approach to analyze the whole transcriptome of individual myofibers by combining single-fiber isolation with Switching Mechanism at 5' end of RNA Template (SMART) technology. Using smfRNA-Seq, we first determined the genes that are expressed in the whole muscle, including in nonmyogenic cells. We also analyzed the differences in the transcriptome of myofibers from young and old mice to validate the effectiveness of this new method. Our results suggest that aging leads to significant changes in the expression of metabolic genes, such as <i>Nos1</i>, and structural genes, such as <i>Myl1</i>, in myofibers. We conclude that smfRNA-Seq is a powerful tool to study developmental, disease-related, and age-related changes in the gene expression profile of skeletal muscle.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Blackburn et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Kinesin-14 HSET/KIFC1 is a crucial protein involved in centrosome clustering. Accordingly, a compound that targets HSET could potentially inhibit cancer cell proliferation in a targeted manner. Here, we report three natural compounds derived from Solidago altissima that restored the growth of fission yeast cells exhibiting lethal HSET overproduction (positive screening), namely solidagonic acid (SA) (1), kolavenic acid analog (KAA: a stereo isomer at C-9 and C-10 of 6β-tigloyloxykolavenic acid) (2), and kolavenic acid (KA) (3). All three compounds suppressed fission yeast cell death and enabled reversion of the mitotic spindles from a monopolar to bipolar morphology. Compound 2, which exerted the strongest activity against HSET-overproducing yeast cells, also inhibited centrosome clustering in MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, which contained large numbers of supernumerary centrosomes. These natural compounds may be useful as bioprobes in studies of HSET function.

As a biomarker of disease, neuropsychological measurement can distinguish normal from pathologic aging processes. Further, neuropsychological data can help distinguish and classify underlying pathologies in dementing diseases, augmenting imaging and biofluid markers in this area. Neuropsychological data can predict increased or reduced risk for dementia conferred by multiple factors, and describe disease trajectory in affected individuals. Cognitive evaluation can also estimate and address functional outcomes that are most important to patients and their loved ones and that are clinically relevant to diagnostic staging. In informing intervention and patient care needs, areas of cognitive weakness highlight targets for support/intervention, while areas of cognitive strength can be capitalized upon to modify the clinical course of disease. These functions can be accomplished through the complementary use of brief screening tools and comprehensive test batteries. However, for neuropsychological data to serve these functions, it is critical to understand neuropsychological test properties and nondisease factors that can account for variance in test performance.

The history should be obtained from the patient as well as collateral sources close to the patient to ensure accuracy and should include contextual elements such as medical history, social, economic, and psychological background, as well as an assessment of current functional state beyond activities of daily living. The safety of the patient, including the presence of physical, psychological, and financial threats, should be addressed during the interview. The neurological examination in older adults may need to be modified to circumvent disabilities such as hearing and visual impairment. Some elements of the neurological examination are expected to be affected by the process of aging, including pupillary reactivity, presbyopia, difficulty with ocular pursuit and up-gaze, reduced or absent distal reflexes, slower motor speed, and reduced ability to tandem walk, among others. In addition to a screening neurological assessment, evaluation of older adults with a particular complaint may require additional interview queries and examination manoeuvres. Common symptoms in the elderly include cognitive difficulties, balance and gait disorders, tremors, and neuropathy. A specialized approach to patients with cognitive difficulties must include assessment of each cognitive domain, including attention, executive function, learning and memory, perceptual-motor function, and social cognition. Balance and gait are essential parts of the neurological examination, and in patients with a history of falls or mobility issues, should become a central part of the evaluation. In patient with tremors, careful observation of the tremor quality (amplitude, frequency, and alleviating/exacerbating factors such as rest, movement, and posture) can aid diagnosis. Evaluation of neuropathy includes determining modality (numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness) and the distribution of symptoms in order to localize the site of nerve injury, which can be supplemented with nerve conduction studies/electromyography, to guide further diagnostic workup and treatment. A combination of detailed history and examination often will suggest a likely underlying neurodegenerative disorder and guide further diagnostic workup to establish a specific diagnosis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Further advances in clinical manifestations of aging and more detailed examination of disease states in the elderly accelerated in the last quarter of the 20th century. Basic, translational, and clinical research support of geriatric neurology studies expanded and advanced during this period and into the 21st century. The size and sophistication of this movement was stimulated by a number of factors: the successful development of geriatrics as a specialty in primary care, internal medicine, and psychiatry; the projected growth of the geriatric population; and the projections of the number of people with Alzheimer's disease. However, there were and continue to be inadequate numbers of trained geriatric neurologists available to care for the 'silver tsunami' of elderly patients with age-related diseases that will present in the next 3 decades. The combination of massive investment in dementia/Alzheimer's research in the past decade, widespread awareness among researchers and trainees of the opportunities to do research in age-related diseases, and the need for further knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases led to a broad expansion of research efforts. Longitudinal clinical studies of the elderly and the advent of sophisticated neuroimaging, genetics, and laboratory techniques are advancing the field. The initiation of therapeutic interventions has led to cautious optimism about the ability to ameliorate suffering in these patients and diminish the burdens of central nervous system aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increasingly, these models also seek to organize care in a manner that addresses cost and efficiency in addition to quality of care. This chapter first revisits the history of chronic care models and then provides a description of successful and sustainable examples of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches for persons with dementia, persons with Parkinson's disease, and the frail elderly. We focus on models for neurodegenerative diseases and draw from the perspectives of research, clinical practice, and informal caregiving. Although focused on neurodegenerative disease, the principles of these approaches reflect the hallmarks of good primary, geriatric, and collaborative care. Many of the current models of care emanate from a medical approach led by physicians and other professional providers within the formal healthcare setting. Innovative approaches, however, now seek to incorporate these medical models within social and community services.

Therefore, the benefits of driving to the individual must be balanced, through careful assessment and diagnosis, with the potential risk to self and others posed by a medically impaired driver. The influence of dementia changes substantially during the disease progression from very mild to mild, and driving is not advised for those who have progressed to the moderate stage of Alzheimer disease. Fortunately, validated high-quality screening instruments, including modern simulators and other technology aids, can help clinicians trichotomize risk (i.e., high, moderate, or low) and determine which patients need further evaluation by a driving specialist (e.g., those in the moderate range). Moreover, a body of evidence is building regarding the efficacy of certain intervention pathways to maintain current levels of driving performance among individuals with dementia, or at least slow its decline. Even with the progression of advanced driving technologies, understanding driving ability of patients with dementia will remain a critical challenge to clinicians for the foreseeable future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Urinary symptoms frequently occur in the setting of neurologic diseases such as Parkinson disease and Parkinson-plus syndromes, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Urinary incontinence is associated with increased caregiver burden and enhances the risk of institutionalization among those living with dementia. Nocturia is associated with impaired sleep and work productivity. Providing patient-centered care for urinary symptoms involves assessing patient and family goals for care and incorporating a multicomponent assessment and treatment plan to align treatment options with the goals for care. Lifestyle and behavioral therapies are available as first-line treatment for most urinary symptoms. Consideration of drug therapy should aim to minimize the potential for adverse drug events such as orthostatic hypotension when using α blockers for men with concomitant prostate enlargement or anticholinergic side effects with anticholinergic bladder relaxant therapy. Interventional therapies such as percutaneous nerve stimulation, cystoscopic botulinum toxin injection, and sacral neuromodulation are available for patients who do not have significant urinary retention at baseline. Containment strategies aim to prevent skin irritation and provide support.

Substantial increases in seizures occur both in the elderly population, who are at a higher risk of developing new-onset epilepsy, and in those with chronic epilepsy who become aged. There are notable gaps in our understanding of aging and epilepsy at the basic and practical levels, which have important consequences. We are in the early stages of understanding the complex relationships between epilepsy and other age-related brain diseases such as stroke, dementia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and cancer. Furthermore, the clinician must recognize that the presentation and treatment of epilepsy in the elderly are different from those of younger populations. Given the developing awareness of the problem and the capabilities of contemporary, multidisciplinary approaches to advance understanding about the biology of aging and epilepsy, it is reasonable to expect that we will unravel some of the intricacies of epilepsy in the elderly; it is also reasonable to expect that these gains will lead to further improvements in our understanding and treatment of epilepsy for all age groups.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Its incidence increases with age. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish symptoms of aging and other comorbidities from those of PD. The diagnosis of PD has traditionally been rendered using strict criteria that mainly rely on the cardinal motor symptoms of rest tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, newer diagnostic criteria proposed by the Movement Disorders Society for diagnosis of PD collectively reflect a greater appreciation for the nonmotor symptoms. The treatment of PD remains symptomatic and the most noticeable improvements have been documented in the motor symptoms. Levodopa remains the gold standard for therapy, however there are now many other potential medical and surgical treatment strategies. Nonmotor symptoms have been shown to affect quality of life more than the motor symptoms. There is ongoing research into symptomatic and disease modifying treatments. Given the multisystem involvement in PD, an interdisciplinary patient-centered approach is recommended by most experts.

Achieving this goal depends on preserving optimal cognitive and brain functioning. Yet, significant individual differences exist in this regard. Some older adults continue to retain most cognitive abilities throughout their lifetime. Others experience declines in cognitive and functional capacity that range from mild decrements in certain cognitive functions over time to severe dementia among those with neurodegenerative diseases. Even among relatively healthy 'successful agers,' certain cognitive functions are reduced from earlier levels. This is particularly true for cognitive functions that are dependent on cognitive processing speed and efficiency. Working memory and executive and attentional functions tend to be most vulnerable. Learning and memory functions are also usually reduced, although in the absence of neurodegenerative disease learning and retrieval efficiency rather than memory storage are affected. Other functions, such as visual perception, language, semantics, and knowledge, are often well preserved. Structural, functional, and physiologic/metabolic brain changes correspond with age-associated cognitive decline. Physiologic and metabolic mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, may contribute to these changes, along with the contribution of comorbidities that secondarily affect the brain of older adults. Cognitive frailty often corresponds with physical frailty, both affected by multiple exogenous and endogenous factors. Neuropsychologic assessment provides a way of measuring the cognitive and functional status of older adults, which is useful for monitoring changes that may be occurring. Neuroimaging is also useful for characterizing age-associated structural, functional, physiologic, and metabolic brain changes, including alterations in cerebral blood flow and metabolite concentrations. Some interventions that may enhance cognitive function, such as cognitive training, neuromodulation, and pharmacologic approaches, exist or are being developed. Yet, preventing, slowing, and reversing the adverse effects of cognitive aging remains a challenge.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A variation in the incidence or prevalence of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) by region or specific populations can be because of greater or lesser exposure to the causal agents of dementia. For example, in the past the striking differences in the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) led to the understanding of the relationship between dietary factors, such as saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, and the incidence of CHD. However, there is a high prevalence of dementia in elderly individuals around the world, and multiple studies conducted in industrialized and nonindustrialized countries have shown an age-standardized prevalence of dementia ranging from 5% to 7% in most countries. Dementia is not a specific disease but rather a constellation of cognitive changes and disability due to several 'causes,' i.e., AD, Lewy bodies, vascular disease, drugs, and alcohol. Whether there is a trend for reduced incidence of dementia has to be further evaluated. It is possible that the improvement in the treatments of risk factors, especially vascular disease, has resulted in decreased incidence. However, this could result in an increase in prevalence, since the improved therapies for risk factors will lead to increased longevity in patients with dementia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

For example, the age-associated remodeling of the immune system (i.e., immunosenescence) and vascular aging per se can contribute to frailty and vulnerability among older adults. They are also described as being implicated in the pathophysiology of some major chronic comorbid conditions such as age-associated diseases of the central (e.g., stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and related disorders) and peripheral (e.g., polyneuropathy) nervous systems. These neurologic disorders are also among the greatest contributors to geriatric syndromes, which refer to highly prevalent and chronic conditions among aged people of multifactorial origin, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty. Neurologic disorders can also occur in patients with one or more geriatric syndromes and thus further interfere with the quality of life, physical function, morbidity, and mortality. This chapter presents and discusses in three sections the complex interrelationships between the main determinants of aging with a specific focus on vascular aging, chronic neurologic disorders, and the specific clinical presentation of geriatric syndromes in older people.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

White matter (WM) lesions (WMLs) are the earliest and most frequent abnormalities, and can be associated with lacunar infarcts and enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS). The prevailing view is that blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage, possibly mediated by pericyte deficiency, plays a pivotal role in the formation of WMLs. Herein, we investigated the involvement of BBB leakage and pericyte loss in CADASIL WMLs. Using post-mortem brain tissue from 12 CADASIL patients and 10 age-matched controls, we found that WMLs are heterogeneous, and that BBB leakage reflects the heterogeneity. Specifically, while fibrinogen extravasation was significantly increased in WMLs surrounding ePVS and lacunes, levels of fibrinogen leakage were comparable in WMLs without other pathology ('pure' WMLs) to those seen in the normal appearing WM of patients and controls. In a mouse model of CADASIL, which develops WMLs but no lacunes or ePVS, we detected no extravasation of endogenous fibrinogen, nor of injected small or large tracers in WMLs. Moreover, there was no evidence of pericyte coverage modification in any type of WML in either CADASIL patients or mice. These data together indicate that WMLs in CADASIL encompass distinct classes of WM changes and argue against the prevailing hypothesis that pericyte coverage loss and BBB leakage are the primary drivers of WMLs. Our results also have important implications for the interpretation of studies on the BBB in living patients, which may misinterpret evidence of BBB leakage within WM hyperintensities as suggesting a BBB related mechanism for all WMLs, when in fact this may only apply to a subset of these lesions.</AbstractText>"}

Small regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) are at the level of post-transcriptional gene suppressors, which enhance the degradation or decay of their target protein-coding mRNAs. These miRNAs are known to play roles in a large number of biological events, cardiovascular development being no exception. A number of critical cardiac-specific miRNAs have been identified, of which structural developmental defects have been linked to dysregulation of miRNAs in the proliferating cardiac stem cells. These miRNAs present in the stem cell niche are lost when the cardiac progenitors terminally differentiate, resulting in the postnatal mitotic arrest of the heart. Therapeutic applications of these miRNAs extend to the realm of heart failure, whereby the death of heart cells in the ageing heart cannot be replaced due to the arrest of cell division. By utilizing miRNA therapy to control cell cycling, the regenerative potential of matured myocardium can be restored. This review will address the various cardiac progenitor-related miRNAs that control the development and proliferative potential of the heart.</AbstractText>"}

Using CCTA, coronary artery disease was classified as <i>normal, nonobstructive</i>, or <i>obstructive</i> according to the presence of 0%, &lt;50%, or ≥50% stenosis, respectively. Coronary artery calcium scores were investigated together with Framingham risk score, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease score, and individual risk factors. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as a composite of cardiac event-related death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. During a median follow-up of 8.2 years (interquartile range: 7.7-10.1 years), MACE occurred in 24 participants (5.1%). Compared with the normal group, participants in the obstructive group showed higher incidence of MACE (hazard ratio: 5.65; 95% CI, 1.22-26.16; <i>P</i>=0.027), whereas there were no significant differences in MACE between the normal and nonobstructive groups. The 8-year event-free survival rates were 98.1±1.1%, 94.9±1.6%, and 81.7±4.8% in the normal, nonobstructive, and obstructive groups, respectively. Compared with the Framingham risk score and coronary artery calcium score model, CCTA improved risk prediction by C-index (from 0.698 to 0.749) and category-free net reclassification index (0.478; <i>P</i>=0.022). Conclusions CCTA showed better long-term prognostic value for MACE than coronary artery calcium score in this asymptomatic older population.</AbstractText>"}

This study compared the predictors of memory performance in older adults with and without exposure to age-related stereotype threat, hypothesizing that activating the stereotype threat modulates the relative weight of metamemory predictors of memory performance.<b>Methods</b>: Participants were 80 older adults (aged 60-84 years) divided into two groups, one with stereotype threat activation and one without; both groups performed an episodic memory task. To activate the stereotype threat, the memory component of the task was emphasized in the instruction given to the threatened group. Both groups also completed two scales of the MIA questionnaire (locus of control and anxiety) to identify potential predictors of memory performance.<b>Results</b>: Results indicated that the non-threatened group performed better than the threatened group on the episodic memory task. They also indicated that factors predicting episodic memory performance varied according to the group. In the non-threatened group, both control and anxiety were involved in memory performance and interacted whereas in the threatened group only anxiety was involved.<b>Conclusion</b>: This study confirms that aging stereotype threat impairs episodic memory performance; it also suggests that stereotype threat disrupts mechanisms underlying memory performance abolishing the role of control over memory regardless of the level of anxiety.</AbstractText>"}

Studies evaluating these interventions report weak or inconclusive results. The objective of this research is to examine the strategic relevance of the interventions by identifying and prioritizing the determinants of physician shortages and analyzing the interventions based on their ability to target the determinants.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS'>First, the determinants of physician shortages were identified and categorized using Mays et al's 2005 method for reviewing qualitative literature. Second, the determinants were prioritized based on importance, severity and solvability, using Lehmann et al's multilevel categorization of factors affecting attraction and retention. Third, the interventions were analyzed based on their ability to target the determinants through a document analysis as descriptive commentary from a policy analysis perspective.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS'>Three individual and 10 contextual (work, rural or international context) determinants of physician shortages were identified. Non-rural background, inadequate training and inadequate incentive structure were prioritized as level 1. Lack of professional support, poor work infrastructure and personal interests were prioritized as level 2. Poor rural infrastructure, inadequate supply planning and cultural difference were prioritized as level 3. Non-minority background, geography and climate, global migration and aging population were prioritized as level 4. Establishing rural medical schools targets the greatest number of priority determinants, followed by financial interventions targeting practicing physicians and non-traditional health services delivery strategies. Curriculum changes, professional support strategies, selective admission to medical schools, financially targeting student physicians and coercive regulatory measures follow. Community support strategies target the fewest number of determinants and trickle-down economic regulation targets none.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION'>Strategic analysis demonstrates that most interventions designed to reduce physician shortages in rural regions are strategically relevant because they address the priority determinants of physician shortages. A link is established between the determinants of physician shortages and the interventions, thereby addressing an important concern expressed in the literature. An original contribution is made to health human resources literature by relying on established theoretical frameworks to achieve a strategic analysis of the interventions.</AbstractText>"}

In response to high temperatures, HSF1 upregulates genes encoding molecular chaperones, also called heat shock proteins, which assist the refolding or degradation of damaged intracellular proteins. Accumulating evidence reveals however that HSF1 participates in several other physiological and pathological processes such as differentiation, immune response, and multidrug resistance, as well as in ageing, neurodegenerative demise, and cancer. To address how HSF1 controls these processes one should systematically analyze its target genes. Here we present a novel database called HSF1Base (hsf1base.org) that contains a nearly comprehensive list of HSF1 target genes identified so far. The list was obtained by manually curating publications on individual HSF1 targets and analyzing relevant high throughput transcriptomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation data derived from the literature and the Yeastract database. To support the biological relevance of HSF1 targets identified by high throughput methods, we performed an enrichment analysis of (potential) HSF1 targets across different tissues/cell types and organisms. We found that general HSF1 functions (targets are expressed in all tissues/cell types) are mostly related to cellular proteostasis. Furthermore, HSF1 targets that are conserved across various animal taxa operate mostly in cellular stress pathways (e.g., autophagy), chromatin remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, and ageing. Together, these data highlight diverse roles for HSF1, expanding far beyond the HSR.</AbstractText>"}

Besides its well-established role in electron transfer reactions, NAD serves as a substrate for other biotransformations, which, at the molecular level, can be classified as protein post-translational modifications (protein deacylation, mono-, and polyADP-ribosylation) and formation of signaling molecules (e.g., cyclic ADP ribose). These biochemical reactions control many crucial biological processes, such as cellular signaling and recognition, DNA repair and epigenetic modifications, stress response, immune response, aging and senescence, and many others. However, the links between the biological effects and underlying molecular processes are often poorly understood. Moreover, NAD has recently been found to tag the 5'-ends of some cellular RNAs, but the function of these NAD-capped RNAs remains largely unrevealed. Synthetic NAD analogs are invaluable molecular tools to detect, monitor, structurally investigate, and modulate activity of NAD-related enzymes and biological processes in order to aid their deeper understanding.

AMD is a multifactorial and only partly understood, malady. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for most AMD patients. It is known that oxidative stress (OS) damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and contributes to the progression of AMD. We review here the potential importance of two OS-related cellular systems in relation to AMD. First, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2)-mediated OS response signalling pathway is important in the prevention of oxidative damage and a failure of this system could be critical in the development of AMD. Second, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a change in the cellular phenotype, which ultimately leads to the fibrosis encountered in RPE, a characteristic of AMD. Many of the pathways triggering EMT are promoted by OS. The possible interconnections between these two signalling routes are discussed here. From a broader perspective, the control of NFE2L2 and EMT as ways of preventing OS-derived cellular damage could be potentially valuable in the therapy of AMD.</AbstractText>"}

The pathogenesis of AMD is still not fully understood. In this study we investigated the in vitro growth and function of primary human RPE cells in response to different ECM substrates, including nitrite-modified ECM. We initially confirmed the presence of disorganised retinal glial and photoreceptor cells, marked retinal cytoplasmic and Bruch's membrane expression of nitro-tyrosine (an oxidative stress marker) and increased numbers of Iba1<sup>+</sup> macrophages/microglia in human donor eye sections (aged and AMD) using multi-marker immunohistochemistry (n = 3). Concurrently, we utilised two-photon microscopy to reveal topographical changes in flatmounts of RPE-associated ECM and in the underlying choroid of aged and AMD donor eyes (n = 3). To recapitulate these observations in vitro, we then used primary human RPE cells to investigate how different ECM proteins, including nitrite cross-linked RPE-secreted ECM, modified RPE cell growth and function. Collagen I or IV increased RPE attachment and spreading two-to three-fold, associated with significantly increased cell migration and proliferation, consistent with a preferential interaction with these matrix substrates. Primary human RPE cells grown on collagen I and IV also showed increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MCP-1 and IL-8. Nitrite-modification of RPE-secreted ECM (simulating ageing of Bruch's membrane) significantly reduced in vitro RPE attachment to the ECM and this was mitigated with collagen IV coating of the modified ECM. Taken together, our observations confirm the importance of RPE-ECM interactions for normal RPE growth and function, and for inducing RPE secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the findings are consistent with ageing and/or oxidative stress-induced disruption of RPE-ECM interactions contributing to the pathogenesis of AMD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Crown Copyright © 2019.

Removing Dmp1 in mice or a mutation in humans leads to hypophosphatemic rickets (identical to X-linked hypophosphatemia). The deformed skeletons were currently thought to be a consequence of an inhibition of chondrogenesis (leading to an accumulation of hypertrophic chondrocytes and a failure in the replacement of cartilage by bone). To precisely study the mechanisms by which DMP1 and phosphorus control temporomandibular condyle formation, we first showed severe malformed condylar phenotypes in Dmp1-null mice (great expansions of deformed cartilage layers and subchondral bone), which worst as aging. Next, we excluded the direct role of DMP1 in condylar hypertrophic-chondrogenesis by conditionally deleting Dmp1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes using Col10a1-Cre and Dmp1 loxP mice (displaying no apparent phosphorous changes and condylar phenotype). To address the mechanism by which the onset of endochondral phenotypes takes place, we generated two sets of tracing lines in the Dmp1 KO background: AggrecanCreERT2-ROSA-tdTomato and Col 10a1-Cre-ROSA-tdTomato, respectively. Both tracing lines displayed an acceleration of chondrogenesis and cell trans-differentiation from chondrocytes into bone cells in the Dmp1 KO. Next, we showed that administrations of neutralizing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) antibodies in Dmp1-null mice restored hypophosphatemic condylar cartilage phenotypes. In further addressing the rescue mechanism, we generated compound mice containing Col10a1-Cre with ROSA-tdTomato and Dmp1 KO lines with and without a high Pi diet starting at day 10 for 39 days. We demonstrated that hypophosphatemia leads to an acceleration of chondrogenesis and trans-differentiation of chondrocytes to bone cells, which were largely restored under a high Pi diet. Finally, we identified the causative molecule (β-catenin). Together, this study demonstrates that the Dmp1-null caused hypophosphatemia, leading to acceleration (instead of inhibition) of chondrogenesis and bone trans-differentiation from chondrocytes but inhibition of bone cell maturation due to a sharp increase in β-catenin. These findings will aid in the future treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets with FGF23 neutralizing antibodies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the use of MPA in therapeutic applications is limited to its poor oral bioavailability, low aqueous solubility, and undesired gastrointestinal side effects. Polymeric micelles are a drug delivery system that has been used to enhance the water solubility of pharmaceuticals. In this work, poloxamer 407 (P407) and MPA were conjugated via an ester linkage resulting in a P407-MPA conjugate. The P407-MPA conjugate was investigated for micellization, particle size, size distribution, MPA release in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and human plasma, and antipsoriatic activity. <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that polymeric micelles formed from the P407-MPA conjugate exposed its polyethylene oxide chain to the aqueous environment while restricting the conjugated MPA within the inner core. The P407-MPA conjugate has an improved micellization property with the over 12-fold lower critical micelle concentration compared to P407. The conjugate exhibited an enzyme-dependent sustained-release property in human plasma. Finally, the conjugate exhibited an improved antiproliferation activity in tumor necrosis factor-α-induced HaCaT cells, which is an in vitro psoriasis model. Therefore, the prepared P407-MPA conjugate, with an improved aqueous solubility and biological activity of MPA, has the potential to be further developed for psoriasis treatment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Pharmacists Association®.

Moench [Poales: Poaceae]) across the United States. Previous research and field observations suggested that both sorghum resistance and growth stage were important to their population dynamics in the field and hence effective and timely management to minimize economic losses associated with this pest. To explore this, we designed greenhouse experiments to quantify fecundity, prereproductive period, and longevity of sugarcane aphids across several vegetative and reproductive growth stages of a resistant (DKS 37-07) and susceptible (M77GB52 and DKS 38-88) sorghum hybrids commonly used in sorghum production. We found significant effects of sorghum resistance and growth stage on several life history traits and demographics parameters of sugarcane aphids. We did not, however, note any significant interactive effects of resistance and phenology on any of the response variables. Sugarcane aphids exposed to the susceptible sorghum produced significantly more offspring, had significantly greater intrinsic and finite rates of increase, and significantly shorter population doubling time than the aphids feeding on resistant sorghum. On the other hand, the impact of sorghum growth stage had more variable effects on life history of sugarcane aphids that were most frequently evident at the late reproductive stages. These outcomes support our hypothesis that sorghum in late stages of growth tends to be a better host for sugarcane aphids and highlight the importance of sorghum growth stage to sugarcane aphid life history and population growth potential.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Blocking myostatin to drive muscle growth is one potential therapeutic approach. While the effects of myostatin depletion on muscle characteristics are well established, we have very little understanding of its effects on the neural system. Here we assess the effects of long-term, post-developmental myostatin reduction on electrophysiological motor unit characteristics and body composition in aging mice. We used male (N = 21) and female (N = 26) mice containing a tetracycline-inducible system to delete the myostatin gene in skeletal muscle. Starting at 12 months of age, half of the mice were administered doxycycline (tetracycline) through their chow for one year. During that time we measured food intake, body composition, and hindlimb electromyographic responses. Doxycycline-induced myostatin reduction had no effect on motor unit properties for either sex, though significant age-dependent declines in motor unit number occurred in all mice. However, treatment with doxycycline induced different changes in body composition between sexes. All female mice increased in total, lean and fat mass, but doxycycline-treated female mice experienced a significantly larger increase in lean mass than controls. All male mice also increased total and lean mass, but administration of doxycycline had no effect. Additionally, doxycycline-treated male mice maintained their fat mass at baseline levels, while the control group experienced a significant increase from baseline and compared to the doxycycline treated group. Our results show that long-term administration of doxycycline results in body composition adaptations that are distinctive between male and female mice, and that the effects of myostatin reduction are most pronounced during the first three months of treatment. We also report that age-related changes in motor unit number are not offset by reduced myostatin levels, despite increased lean mass exhibited by female mice.</AbstractText>"}

This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence, burden and further identify socioeconomic factors influencing ethnic differences in knee pain and symptoms of OA among older adults aged 55 years and over in Greater Kuala Lumpur (the capital city of Malaysia). The sample for the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) was selected using stratified random sampling, by age and ethnicity from the electoral rolls of three parliamentary constituencies. Information on knee pain was available in 1226 participants, mean age (SD) 68.96 (1.57) years (409 Malay, 416 Chinese, 401 Indian). The crude and weighted prevalence of knee pain and self-reported knee OA symptoms were 33.3% and 30.8% respectively. There were significant ethnic differences in knee pain (crude prevalence: Malays 44.6%, Chinese 23.5% and Indians 31.9%, p&lt;0.001). The presence of two or more non-communicable diseases (NCD) attenuated the increased risk of knee pain among the ethnic Indians compared to the ethnic Chinese. The prevalence of knee pain remained significantly higher among the ethnic Malays after adjustment for confounders. While the prevalence of knee pain in our older population appears similar to that reported in other published studies in Asia, the higher prevalence among the ethnic Malays has not previously been reported. Further research to determine potential genetic susceptibility to knee pain among the ethnic Malays is recommended.</AbstractText>"}

However, ionising radiation can provoke significant variations in bone morphometric parameters. In a previous study, we evaluated the effect of reducing the integration time on the properties of the mouse tibia measured from microCT images. A scanning procedure (100 ms integration time, 256 mGy nominal radiation dose) was selected as the best compromise between image quality and radiation dose induced on the animal. In this work, the effect of repeated in vivo scans has been evaluated using the selected procedure. The right tibia of twelve female C57BL/6 (six wild type, WT, six ovariectomised, OVX) and twelve BALB/c (six WT, six OVX) mice was scanned every two weeks, starting at week 14 of age. At week 24, mice were sacrificed and both tibiae were scanned. Standard trabecular and cortical morphometric parameters were calculated. The spatial distribution of densitometric parameters (e.g. bone mineral content) was obtained by dividing each tibia in 40 partitions. Stiffness and strength in compression were estimated using homogeneous linear elastic microCT-based micro-Finite Element models. Differences between right (irradiated) and left (non-irradiated control) tibiae were evaluated for each parameter. The irradiated tibiae had higher Tb.Th (+3.3%) and Tb.Sp (+11.6%), and lower Tb.N (-14.2%) compared to non-irradiated tibiae, consistently across both strains and intervention groups. A reduction in Tb.BV/TV (-14.9%) was also observed in the C57BL/6 strain. In the OVX group, a small reduction was also observed in Tt.Ar (-5.0%). In conclusion, repeated microCT scans (at 256 mGy, 5 scans, every two weeks) had limited effects on the mouse tibia, compared to the expected changes induced by bone treatments. Therefore, the selected scanning protocol is acceptable for measuring the effect of bone interventions in vivo.</AbstractText>"}

We hypothesize that <i>GBA</i> mutations impair mitochondria quality control in a neurosphere model.We have characterized mitochondrial content, mitochondrial function and macroautophagy flux in 3D-neurosphere-model derived from neural crest stem cells containing heterozygous and homozygous <i><sub>N370S</sub>GBA</i> mutations, under carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl-hydrazine (CCCP)- induced mitophagy.Our findings on mitochondrial markers and ATP levels indicate that mitochondrial accumulation occurs in mutant <i><sub>N370S</sub>GBA</i> neurospheres under basal conditions, and clearance of depolarised mitochondria is impaired following CCCP-treatment. A significant increase in TFEB-mRNA levels, the master regulator of lysosomal and autophagy genes, may explain an unchanged macroautophagy flux in <i><sub>N370S</sub>GBA</i> neurospheres. PGC1α-mRNA levels were also significantly increased following CCCP-treatment in heterozygote, but not homozygote neurospheres, and might contribute to the increased mitochondrial content seen in cells with this genotype, probably as a compensatory mechanism that is absent in homozygous lines.Mitochondrial impairment occurs early in the development of GCase-deficient neurons. Furthermore, impaired turnover of depolarised mitochondria is associated with early mitochondrial dysfunction.In summary, the presence of <i>GBA</i> mutation may be associated with higher levels of mitochondrial content in homozygous lines and lower clearance of damaged mitochondria in our neurosphere model.</AbstractText>"}

The association of sociodemographic factors and self-reported cognitive and health status with low cognitive performance is also investigated. Methods-During 2011-2014, the cognitive performance of participants aged 60 and over was assessed during the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Cognitive assessment was based on scores from established objective cognitive tests (word list learning with immediate and delayed recall, animal naming, and a digit symbol substitution test). Mean scores and percentile distributions were described by sociodemographic characteristics. Logistic regression modeling was conducted to evaluate the relationship of sociodemographic and self-reported health factors with low cognitive performance, defined by scores in the lowest 25th percentile. The relationship between objective cognitive functioning measures and subjective cognitive decline also was evaluated by calculating sensitivity and specificity measures. Results-A total of 3,181 adults completed at least one of four objective cognitive tests. Mean scores for men were lower than for women in three of four assessments. Mean scores decreased with increasing age and with decreasing level of income and education. Persons reporting poorer health status and subjective cognitive decline were more likely to have low performance on the four assessments. The subjective cognitive decline question had low sensitivity (22.9%-26.7%) in identifying low cognitive performers, but had high specificity in identifying those who did not score low on the cognitive assessments (89.3%-90.9%). Conclusions-Cognitive performance has important implications for the U.S. aging population. Subjective cognitive decline along with older age, low income, low educational attainment, and fair or poor self-reported health were independently associated with lower cognitive performance in a representative sample of U.S. older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>All material appearing in this report is in the public domain and may be reproduced or copied without permission; citation as to source, however, is appreciated.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Defective clearance mechanisms result in toxic levels of soluble Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers, leading to impaired synaptic function, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Growing evidence points to the involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1), an ATP-binding cassette transporter highly expressed on the luminal side of the blood-brain barrier, in facilitating the clearance of Aβ from the brain. In this review, we summarise evidence from human, animal and in vitro studies examining the contribution of P-gp to Aβ clearance, and discuss the potential for P-gp as a novel pharmacological target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). P-gp expression and activity in the brain are inversely correlated with ageing, Aβ deposition and AD. Moreover, Aβ itself has been found to compromise the expression of P-gp, thereby exacerbating Aβ deposition and disease. Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of AD remains elusive. Understanding the normal versus impaired processing and clearance mechanisms affecting Aβ peptides will assist the development of more effective therapeutic agents to combat this progressive neurodegenerative condition that continues to devastate millions of patients globally.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Regular aerobic exercise upregulated CAMKIIα expression level, activated the CAMK signaling pathway, and promoted the expression of autophagy markers Beclin1 and microtubule-associated proteins 1 A/1B light chain 3II. Aberrant carbonylation of CAMKII initiated age-related changes and might be useful as a potential biomarker of PD.

During the infection process, the pathogen exploits its large genome, encoding complex regulatory networks and a wide range of virulence factors, including motility and the secretion of various proteases and toxins. Although antibiotic resistance levels in the UK are low, higher levels have been seen in some other countries. In the face of increasing antibiotic resistance, alternative therapeutic approaches such as antivirulence strategies and phage therapy are being developed. There is increasing evidence to suggest that keratitis infections are associated with a phylogenetic subgroup of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates carrying the gene encoding the potent cytotoxin exotoxin U, one of two mutually exclusive exotoxins secreted via the type III secretion system. The mechanisms behind this association are unclear, but understanding the genetic differences that predispose <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to cause corneal infections may allow for the development of targeted and more effective future treatments to reduce the morbidity of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> keratitis.

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether performance in auditory and visual reflective attention tasks varies as a function of participants' age and hearing status.<i>Methods</i>: Young (19 to 33 years) and older adults with normal or mild to moderate hearing loss (62-90 years) completed a delayed match-to-sample task in which participants were first presented with a memory array of four different digits to hold in memory. Two digits were presented visually (left and right hemifield), and two were presented aurally (left and right ears simultaneously). During the retention interval, participants were presented with a cue (dubbed retro-cue), which could be either uninformative or indicated to the participants to retrospectively orient their attention to either auditory short-term memory (ASTM) or visual short-term memory (VSTM). The cue was followed by another delay, after which a single item was presented (i.e., test probe) for comparison (match or no match) with the items held in ASTM and/or VSTM.<i>Results</i>: Overall, informative retro-cue yielded faster response time than uninformative retro-cue. The retro-cue benefit in response time was comparable for auditory and visual-orienting retro-cue and similar in young and older adults.

This finding highlights changes in cognitive processes that come with age even in those with just mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and suggest that older adults' performance in working memory tasks is sensitive to low level auditory scene analysis (i.e., concurrent sound segregation).</AbstractText>"}

Learning, memory, and cognition","Date":"Nov 21 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Whereas executive functions are known to be closely tied to successful language processing in children and younger adults, less is known about how age-related decline in these functions affects language processing in elderly adults. Because the abilities to use linguistic context and resolve potential ambiguities such as between an idiom's figurative and literal meaning depend on executive functions, we investigated this issue by examining elderly adults' processing of idioms in context. We recorded event-related potentials of 25 younger (age 18-28) and 25 elderly adults (age 61-74) while they read literal sentences and sentences containing an idiom (e.g., the Dutch idiom <i>to walk against the lamp,</i> meaning 'to get caught'), each preceded by a neutral or predictive context sentence. Participants' use of context was hypothesized to relate to working memory capacity, while their ability to disambiguate idioms was hypothesized to depend on inhibition skills. Both groups showed facilitated processing for idioms compared with literal sentences and for sentences preceded by predictive compared with neutral contexts, indexed by a reduced N400. However, only elderly adults showed an increased P600 for literal but not idiomatic sentences preceded by a predictive context, suggesting that they rely on linguistic context when a sentence's meaning needs to be computed word by word, but not when a large part is retrieved from memory (as in idioms). Our findings suggest that in both younger and elderly adults processing literal sentences requires more cognitive effort than processing idiomatic sentences, and that cognitive aging affects language when processing is effortful.

However, most research assessing the body-emotion link focuses on young adult samples. Inspired by prior work showing age-related declines in autonomic reactivity and interoception, we present 2 studies investigating age-related differences in the extent to which adults (18-75 years) associate interoceptive or internal bodily sensations with emotions. Study 1 (<i>N</i> = 150) used a property association task to assess age effects on adults' tendencies to associate interoceptive sensations, relative to behaviors or situations, with negative emotion categories (e.g., anger, sadness). Study 2 (<i>N</i> = 200) used the Day Reconstruction experience sampling method to assess the effect of age on adults' tendencies to report interoceptive sensations and emotional experiences in daily life. Consistent with prior literature suggesting that older adults have more muted physiological responses and interoceptive abilities than younger adults, we found that older adults' mental representations (Study 1) and self-reported experiences (Study 2) of emotion are less associated with interoceptive sensations than are those of younger adults. Across both studies, age effects were most prominent for high arousal emotions (e.g., anger, fear) and sensations (e.g., racing heart) that are often associated with peripheral psychophysiological concomitants in young adults. These findings are consistent with psychological constructionist models and a 'maturational dualism' account of emotional aging, suggesting additional pathways by which emotions may differ across adulthood.

The mechanisms that link water stress in plants to insect performance are not well understood. Here, we build on previous reviews and develop a framework that incorporates the severity and longevity of drought and captures the plant physiological adjustments that follow moderate and severe drought. Using this framework, we investigate in greater depth how insect performance responds to increasing drought severity for: (i) different feeding guilds; (ii) flush feeders and senescence feeders; (iii) specialist and generalist insect herbivores; and (iv) temperate versus tropical forest communities. We outline how intermittent and moderate drought can result in increases of carbon-based and nitrogen-based chemical defences, whereas long and severe drought events can result in decreases in plant secondary defence compounds. We predict that different herbivore feeding guilds will show different but predictable responses to drought events, with most feeding guilds being negatively affected by water stress, with the exception of wood borers and bark beetles during severe drought and sap-sucking insects and leaf miners during moderate and intermittent drought. Time of feeding and host specificity are important considerations. Some insects, regardless of feeding guild, prefer to feed on younger tissues from leaf flush, whereas others are adapted to feed on senescing tissues of severely stressed trees. We argue that moderate water stress could benefit specialist insect herbivores, while generalists might prefer severe drought conditions. Current evidence suggests that insect outbreaks are shorter and more spatially restricted in tropical than in temperate forests. We suggest that future research on the impact of drought on insect communities should include (i) assessing how drought-induced changes in various plant traits, such as secondary compound concentrations and leaf water potential, affect herbivores; (ii) food web implications for other insects and those that feed on them; and (iii) interactions between the effects on insects of increasing drought and other forms of environmental change including rising temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. There is a need for larger, temperate and tropical forest-scale drought experiments to look at herbivorous insect responses and their role in tree death.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

These have been related to frontal hemispheric asymmetries in clinical and resting-state EEG studies: Approach was linked to higher activity of the left relative to the right hemisphere, while avoidance was related to the opposite pattern. Increased approach behaviour, specifically towards unhealthy foods, is also observed in obesity and has been linked to asymmetry in the framework of the right-brain hypothesis of obesity. Here, we aimed to replicate previous EEG findings of hemispheric asymmetries for self-reported approach/avoidance behaviour and to relate them to eating behaviour. Further, we assessed whether resting fMRI hemispheric asymmetries can be detected and whether they are related to approach/avoidance, eating behaviour and BMI. We analysed three samples: Sample 1 (n = 117) containing EEG and fMRI data from lean participants, and Samples 2 (n = 89) and 3 (n = 152) containing fMRI data from lean, overweight and obese participants. In Sample 1, approach behaviour in women was related to EEG, but not to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. In Sample 2, approach/avoidance behaviours were related to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. Finally, hemispheric asymmetries were not related to either BMI or eating behaviour in any of the samples. Our study partly replicates previous EEG findings regarding hemispheric asymmetries and indicates that this relationship could also be captured using fMRI. Our findings suggest that eating behaviour and obesity are likely to be mediated by mechanisms not directly relating to frontal asymmetries in neuronal activation quantified with EEG and fMRI.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The results showed that psorachromene significantly repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and increased the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents against OSCC cells. The repressive effects of psorachromene were attributable to the inhibition of EGFR-Slug signaling, and the induction of G2/M arrest and apoptosis in the OSCC cells.

Progress, however, is often limited by the low heritability of these animal fitness traits in addition to measurement difficulties. In this respect, relevant early-life biomarkers may be useful for breeding purposes. Telomere length (TL), measured in leukocytes, is a good candidate biomarker since TL has been associated with health, ageing, and stress in humans and other species. However, telomere studies are very limited in farm animals. Here, we examined the genetic background, genomic architecture, and factors affecting bovine TL measurements in early life, and the association of the latter with animal fitness traits expressed later in life associated with survival, longevity, health, and reproduction. We studied two TL measurements, one at birth (TLB) and another during the first lactation (TLFL) of a cow. We performed a genome-wide association study of dairy cattle TL, the first in a non-human species, and found that TLB and TLFL are complex, polygenic, moderately heritable, and highly correlated traits. However, genomic associations with distinct chromosomal regions were identified for the two traits suggesting that their genomic architecture is not identical. This is reflected in changes in TL throughout an individual's life. TLB had a significant association with survival, length of productive life and future health status of the animal, and could be potentially used as an early-life biomarker for disease predisposition and longevity in dairy cattle.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ilska-Warner, Psifidi, Seeker, Wilbourn, Underwood, Fairlie, Whitelaw, Nussey, Coffey and Banos.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Studies considering both age and sex remain limited, despite sex dimorphism of astrocytes and microglial cells is largely recognized. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effect of a single intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult and aged mice. We assessed the expression of different inflammatory mediators, and the microglial response through binding of [<sup>18</sup>F]-VC701 tracer to translocator protein (TSPO) receptors in the male and female brain. Aged female brain showed a higher pro-inflammatory response to LPS compared to adult female and to aged male, as revealed by <i>ex vivo</i> binding to TSPO receptors and pro-inflammatory mediator transcript levels. The highest astroglial reaction was observed in the brain of aged females. Differently to the other groups of animals, in aged males LPS challenge did not affect transcription of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). In conclusion, our study shows that in the mouse's brain the neuro-inflammatory response to an acute peripheral insult is sex- and age-dependent. Moreover, our results might set the basis for further studies aimed at identifying sex-related targets involved in the modulation of the aberrant neuro-inflammatory response that characterizes aging.

A recent improvement to traditional MRI measurements of BBPC, called calibrated short TR recovery (CaSTRR), has demonstrated a significant reduction in acquisition time for BBPC maps in mice. In this study CaSTRR is applied to a cohort of healthy canines (<i>n</i> = 17, age = 5.0 - 8.0 years) using a protocol suited for application in humans at 3T. The imaging protocol included CaSTRR for BBPC maps, pseudo-continuous ASL for CBF maps, and high resolution anatomical images. The standard CaSTRR method of normalizing BBPC to gadolinium-doped deuterium oxide phantoms was also compared to normalization using hematocrit (Hct) as a proxy value for blood water content. The results show that CaSTRR is able to produce high quality BBPC maps with a 4 min acquisition time. The BBPC maps demonstrate significantly higher BBPC in gray matter (0.83 ± 0.05 mL/g) than in white matter (0.78 ± 0.04 mL/g, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Maps of CBF acquired with pCASL demonstrate a negative correlation between gray matter perfusion and age (<i>p</i> = 0.003). Voxel-wise correction for BBPC is also shown to improve contrast to noise ratio between gray and white matter in CBF maps. A novel aspect of the study was to show that that BBPC measurements can be calculated based on the known Hct of the blood sample placed in scanner. We found a strong correlation (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.81 in gray matter, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.59 in white matter) established between BBPC maps normalized to the doped phantoms and BBPC maps normalized using Hct. This obviates the need for doped water phantoms which simplifies both the acquisition protocol and the post-processing methods. Together this suggests that CaSTRR represents a feasible, rapid method to account for BBPC variability when quantifying CBF. As canines have been used widely for aging and Alzheimer's disease studies, the CaSTRR method established in the animals may further improve CBF measurements and advance our understanding of cerebrovascular changes in aging and neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Thalman, Powell, Ubele, Norris, Head and Lin.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Adding the amount of protein-protein interaction between two others, synaptosome-associated protein-25 and syntaxin, explained 6% of overall variance. The presynaptic protein Munc18-1 long variant was localized to inhibitory terminals, and like complexin-I, was positively associated with cognition. Associations depended on Braak stage, with the level of complexin-I contributing nearly 15% to cognitive variation in stages 0-II, while complexin-II contributed 7% in stages V-VI.

Moreover, it points out to the existence of differences between bone marrow and peripheral fat metabolism which may be relevant for developing therapeutic strategies for treatment of metabolic bone diseases.</AbstractText>"}

PCR analyses on genomic DNA samples confirmed that the size of the MUC6 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region was highly polymorphic. In a cohort of autopsied subjects with quantitative digital pathology data (n = 119), the size of the polymorphic region was associated with the severity of pTau pathology in neocortex. In a separate replication cohort of autopsied subjects (n = 173), more pTau pathology was again observed in subjects with longer VNTR regions (p = 0.031). Unlike MUC6, AP2A2 is highly expressed in human brain. AP2A2 expression was lower in a subset analysis of brain samples from persons with longer versus shorter VNTR regions (p = 0.014 normalizing with AP2B1 expression). Double-label immunofluorescence studies showed that AP2A2 protein often colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles in LOAD but was not colocalized with pTau proteinopathy in progressive supranuclear palsy, or with TDP-43 proteinopathy. In summary, polymorphism in a repeat-rich region near AP2A2 was associated with neocortical pTau proteinopathy (because of the unique repeats, prior genome-wide association studies were probably unable to detect this association), and AP2A2 was often colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles in LOAD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The growth of biobanks linked to electronic medical record (EMR) data has both facilitated and increased the demand for efficient, accurate, and robust approaches for phenotyping millions of patients. Challenges to phenotyping with EMR data include variation in the accuracy of codes, as well as the high level of manual input required to identify features for the algorithm and to obtain gold standard labels. To address these challenges, we developed PheCAP, a high-throughput semi-supervised phenotyping pipeline. PheCAP begins with data from the EMR, including structured data and information extracted from the narrative notes using natural language processing (NLP). The standardized steps integrate automated procedures, which reduce the level of manual input, and machine learning approaches for algorithm training. PheCAP itself can be executed in 1-2 d if all data are available; however, the timing is largely dependent on the chart review stage, which typically requires at least 2 weeks. The final products of PheCAP include a phenotype algorithm, the probability of the phenotype for all patients, and a phenotype classification (yes or no).</AbstractText>"}

Here, using a computational approach, we estimate that 20% of the male population represented in the UK Biobank study (n = 205,011) has detectable LOY. We identify 156 autosomal genetic determinants of LOY, which we replicate in 757,114 men of European and Japanese ancestry. These loci highlight genes that are involved in cell-cycle regulation and cancer susceptibility, as well as somatic drivers of tumour growth and targets of cancer therapy. We demonstrate that genetic susceptibility to LOY is associated with non-haematological effects on health in both men and women, which supports the hypothesis that clonal haematopoiesis is a biomarker of genomic instability in other tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies dysregulated expression of autosomal genes in leukocytes with LOY and provides insights into why clonal expansion of these cells may occur. Collectively, these data highlight the value of studying clonal mosaicism to uncover fundamental mechanisms that underlie cancer and other ageing-related diseases.</AbstractText>"}

We have uncovered largely disjoint sets of genes regulating these dissociable learning processes in different clusters of people with (1) unregulated temperament profiles (i.e., associatively conditioned habits and emotional reactivity), (2) organized character profiles (i.e., intentional self-control of emotional conflicts and goals), and (3) creative character profiles (i.e., self-aware appraisal of values and theories), respectively. However, little is known about how these temperament and character components of personality are jointly organized and develop in an integrated manner. In three large independent genome-wide association studies from Finland, Germany, and Korea, we used a data-driven machine learning method to uncover joint phenotypic networks of temperament and character and also the genetic networks with which they are associated. We found three clusters of similar numbers of people with distinct combinations of temperament and character profiles. Their associated genetic and environmental networks were largely disjoint, and differentially related to distinct forms of learning and memory. Of the 972 genes that mapped to the three phenotypic networks, 72% were unique to a single network. The findings in the Finnish discovery sample were blindly and independently replicated in samples of Germans and Koreans. We conclude that temperament and character are integrated within three disjoint networks that regulate healthy longevity and dissociable systems of learning and memory by nearly disjoint sets of genetic and environmental influences.</AbstractText>"}

Exenatide release from PT320 exhibited a triphasic pharmacokinetic profile. An initial peak occurred at 3 hr post-administration, a secondary peak at 5 days, and achievement of Exenatide steady-state plasma levels from day 10-28. Systemic exposure increased across PT320 doses, and Exenatide levels were maintained above the therapeutic threshold prior to achieving a steady-state. In contrast, Exenatide release from Bydureon exhibited a biphasic profile, with an initial plasma peak at 3 hr, followed by a rapid decline to a sub-therapeutic concentration, and a gradual elevation to provide a steady-state from day 35-49. Exenatide total exposure, evaluated from the area under the time-dependent Exenatide concentration curve, was similar for equivalent doses of PT320 and Bydureon. The former, however, reached and maintained steady-state plasma Exenatide levels more rapidly, without dipping to a sub-therapeutic concentration. Both SR-Exenatide formulations proved well-tolerated and, following a well-regulated initial release burst, generated steady-state plasma levels of Exenatide, but with PT320 producing continuous therapeutic Exenatide levels and more rapidly reaching a steady-state.</AbstractText>"}

In the present study, RNA-sequencing was performed for 32 clinical ovarian specimens obtained from 24 Japanese patients (24 primary cancer specimens and 8 recurrent specimens paired with corresponding primary cancer specimens). Mutations in 24 primary specimens were analyzed by comparing the sequence data mapped on RefSeq genes with those in the public online databases BRCA Exchange, COSMIC, ClinVar, and cBioportal. Mutations were observed in TP53 in 16 specimens (67%), BRCA1 in 9 (38%), BRCA2 in 13 (54%), ARID1A in 3 (13%), PIK3CA in 2 (8%), KRAS in 1 (4%), PTEN in 1 (4%), and CTNNB1 in 1 (4%), excluding synonymous mutations.

Low doses of interleukin-15 (IL-15) that mimic exercise responses in the circulation improve skin structure and increase mitochondria in uninjured aged skin, suggesting that IL-15 is an essential mitochondrial signal for healing that is lost during aging. Here we used gene microarray analysis of old and young murine epidermal stem cells and demonstrate that aging results in a gene signature characteristic of bioenergetic dysfunction. Intravenous IL-15 treatment rescued chronological aging-induced healing defects and restored youthful wound closure in old, sedentary mice. Additionally, exercise-mediated improvements in the healing of aged skin depend upon circulating IL-15. We show that IL-15 induces signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling characteristic of young animals, reduces markers of growth arrest, and increases keratinocyte and fibroblast growth. Moreover, exercise or exercise-mimicking IL-15 treatment rescued the age-associated decrease in epidermal mitochondrial complex IV activity. Overall, these results indicate that IL-15 or its analogs represent promising therapies for treating impaired wound healing in elderly patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wong et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This work aimed at investigating the effect of Al-toxicity on synaptosomal membrane biophysical properties and lipid peroxidation during 65 days. We utilized ATR-IR spectroscopy to study the changes in membrane biochemical structure and biophysical properties of isolated rat cortical synaptosomes, and EPR spin trapping and labeling to follow NADPH oxidase activity and changes of membrane order parameter, respectively. The results showed increase in membrane fluidity and disorder in early 21d of AlCl<sub>3</sub> treatment, while after 42d the membrane rigidity, packing, and order increased. The late (65d) an increase in the amount of unsaturated fatty acids, the accumulation of lipid peroxide end products, and ROS production were detected in rat cortex synaptosomes mediated by Al toxicity and oxidative stress (OS). A dramatic increase was also detected in Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, synaptic membrane polarity, and EPR-detected order S-parameter. These outcomes strongly suggest that the synaptosomal membrane phospholipids underwent free radical attacks mediated by AlCl<sub>3</sub> due to greater NOX activity, and the release of synaptic vesicles into synaptic cleft might be hindered. The adopted spectroscopic techniques have shed light on the biomolecular structure and membrane biophysical changes of isolated cortical synaptosomes for the first time, allowing researchers to move closer to a complete understanding of pathological tissues.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The compositional engineering in perovskite materials and other buffer layers makes it a feasible candidate for commercial applications in the near future. However, there are certain challenges associated with these devices which need to be addressed such as device stability, process dependent device efficiency, hole transport layer (HTL) etc. The device performance is highly dependent on the processing parameters of the precursors. Understanding the origin of this challenge is very crucial for reproducible device performance. In this work, we have focused on utilizing NiO as a HTL in planar perovskite solar cells and studied the ageing effect of NiO precursor solution on the perovskite film quality in terms of crystallinity, grain growth, surface morphology, and overall device performance. It is observed that the ageing of NiO precursor promotes the formation of NiO films with increased roughness which improves the perovskite film quality. Structural and morphological studies revealed that the perovskite films formed on aged NiO films were highly crystalline in nature, uniform and with larger grain size. Current- voltage characteristics under illumination show that the films casted from NiO aged solution are better for perovskite solar cell applications and result in reduced parasitic resistances and enhanced charge transport.</AbstractText>"}

The synchronous treatment of cardio-cerebral conditions based on an integral strategy may bring benefit to the better clinical efficacy. The simultaneously-targeting delivery of active molecules by nanoscale carriers to heart and brain remains unmet problem. The physiological difference of targets between heart and brain makes it a huge challenge which one targeting ligand modification acquires the delivery of two organs and treatment, simultaneously. Traditionally, dually targeting strategies are introduced to enhance the selectivity for one aimed tissue and delivery efficiency of these particles. However, the interference between two targeting ligands on the surface of nanoscale carriers may influence the affinity of these ligands with their receptors or transporters, resulting to the change distribution of carriers. Herein, we observed that how anti-cardiac troponin I (cTnI) antibody (Ab) conjugated with the linker, polyethylene glycol (PEG), on the surface of liposomes influenced the affinity of mannose derivatives with transporter and regulated distribution of these vesicles in the heart and brain. The dually targeting liposomes can target to the heart and brain tissue simultaneously by the regulation length of PEG chain linking with p -pentanoic acid phenyl-<i>α</i>-D-acetylmannosamine (Ac₄MAN).

This network model is made of only non-aging components: the strength of gene interactions declines with a constant mortality rate. Death of a cell occurs in the model when an essential node loses all of its interactions with other nodes, and is equivalent to the deletion of an essential gene. Stochasticity of gene interactions is modeled using a binomial distribution. We show that the exponential increase of mortality rate over time can emerge from this gene network model during the early stages of aging.We developed a maximal likelihood approach to estimate three lifespan-influencing network parameters from experimental lifespans: t<sub>0</sub>, the initial virtual age of the network system; n, the average lifespan-influencing interactions per essential node; and R, the initial mortality rate. We applied this model to yeast mutants with known effects on replicative lifespans. We found that deletion of SIR2, FOB1, and HXK2 considerably altered the initial virtual age but not the average lifespan-influencing interactions per essential node, suggesting that these mutations mainly influence the reliability of gene interactions but not the overall configurations of gene networks.We applied this model to investigate replicative lifespans of yeast natural isolates. We estimated that the average number of lifespan-influencing interactions per essential node is 7.0 (6.1-8) and the average estimated initial virtual age is 45.4 (30.6-74) cell divisions in these isolates.

Participants learned categories determined by a disjunctive rule with relational features through a feedback training procedure. During training, participants responded to strategy probes following each block to provide online assessment of the extent to which rule- and exemplar-based strategies were used throughout the training period. We introduced this measure as an alternative to model-based approaches to assessing individual differences in strategy use during training. Following training, participants classified ambiguous transfer objects that were assumed to distinguish between earlier use of rule- and exemplar-based learning strategies. We included this measure to obtain a relatively objective index of strategy use during training. Next, participants provided global ratings of their use of rule- and exemplar-based strategies during training. Results showed that strategy preferences expressed on the final training block predicted categorisation of ambiguous transfer objects better than global strategy reports. In addition, we utilised the block-by-block strategy reports to investigate the dynamics of learners' strategy preferences over the course of training. The findings revealed greater fluidity in strategy preferences for both younger and older adults than has been previously documented in the category learning literature.

Exposure to 35µM BRT significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased glucose consumption until exhaustion after 72 hours. Platelet aggregation and activation was significantly impaired by BRT. Mitochondrial superoxide production and phosphatidylserine expression were significantly elevated following glucose exhaustion, with decreased viability observed from day five onwards. Lactate accumulation and loss of bicarbonate, support a metabolic disturbance, leading to a decline of quality following BRT inclusion. Although acute <i>ex vivo</i> BRT exposure reported potentially beneficial effects, translation from acute to chronic exposure failed to combat declining platelet function during storage. BRT exposure resulted in perturbations of platelet quality, with the utility of BRT during storage therefore limited.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which CalcR signaling regulates quiescence in MuSCs are enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of the catalytic domain of protein kinase A (PKA) restores the quiescence of CalcR-mutant MuSCs and delays MuSC activation. Mechanistically, CalcR-activated PKA phosphorylates Lats1/2, the main effector of Hippo signaling, thereby inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of Yap1, which prevents expression of Hippo-target genes, including cell-cycle-related molecules.

However, the molecular basis of age-related cumulative stress in ALS pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we found that mice deficient in NPGPx (GPx7), an oxidative stress sensor, develop ALS-like phenotypes, including paralysis, muscle denervation, and motor neurons loss. Unlike normal spinal motor neurons that exhibit elevated O-GlcNAcylation against age-dependent oxidative stress, NPGPx-deficient spinal motor neurons fail to boost O-GlcNAcylation and exacerbate ROS accumulation, leading to cell death. Mechanistically, stress-activated NPGPx inhibits O-GlcNAcase (OGA) through disulfide bonding to fine-tune global O-GlcNAcylation. Pharmacological inhibition of OGA rescues spinal motor neuron loss in aged NPGPx-deficient mice. Furthermore, expression of NPGPx in ALS patients is significantly lower than in unaffected adults. These results suggest that NPGPx modulates O-GlcNAcylation by inhibiting OGA to cope with age-dependent oxidative stress and protect motor neurons from degeneration, providing a potential therapeutic axis for ALS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)-electrophysiological signatures of memory reactivation in the hippocampus-are a compelling candidate for this purpose. Mouse models of AD show reductions in both SWR abundance and associated slow gamma (SG) power during aging, but these alterations have yet to be directly linked to memory impairments. In aged apolipoprotein E4 knockin (apoE4-KI) mice-a model of the major genetic risk factor for AD-we find that reduced SWR abundance and associated CA3 SG power predicted spatial memory impairments measured 1-2 months later. Importantly, SWR-associated CA3 SG power reduction in young apoE4-KI mice also predicted spatial memory deficits measured 10 months later. These results establish features of SWRs as potential functional biomarkers of memory impairment in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we characterized the single-cell expression profiling of 121 cell samples and found 44 metastasis-associated marker genes. Accordingly, we trained and validated 17 pivotal metastasis-associated genes (MAGs) in 626 patients incorporating internal and external cohorts to evaluate the model for predicting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Correlation analysis revealed that the MAGs correlated significantly with several risk clinical characteristics. Moreover, we conducted Cox regression analysis integrating these independent clinical variables into a MAGs nomogram with superior accuracy in predicting progression events. We further revealed the differential landscape of somatic tumor mutation burden (TMB) between two nomogram-score groups and observed that TMB was also a prognostic biomarker; patients with high MAGs-nomogram scores suffered from a higher TMB, potentially leading to worse prognosis. Last, higher MAGs-nomogram scores correlated with the upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, the Wnt signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling crosstalk in ccRCC. Overall, we constructed the robust MAGs through scRNA-seq and validated the model in a large patient population, which was valuable for prognostic stratification and providing potential targets against metastatic ccRCC.</AbstractText>"}

Here, a series of low-cost, conjugated polymers are designed and applied as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs, featuring tuned energy levels, good temperature and humidity resistivity, and excellent photoelectric properties. Further studies highlight the critical and multifaceted roles of the polymers with respect to facilitating charge separation, passivating the surface trap sites of perovskite materials, and guaranteeing long-term stability of the devices. A stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3% and remarkably enhanced device longevity are achieved using the dopant-free polymer <b>P3</b> with a low concentration of 5 mg/mL, qualifying the device as one of the best PSC systems constructed on the basis of dopant-free HTMs so far.

However, the mechanisms behind this sexual dimorphism are yet to be fully understood. It is well established that cerebral ischemia activates a variety of inflammatory cascades and that microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain. After ischemic injury, microglia are activated and play a crucial role in progression and resolution of the neuroinflammatory response. In recent years, research has focused on the role that microglia play in this sexual dimorphism that exists in the response to central nervous system (CNS) injury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms leading to microglial activation and polarization of phenotypes may be influenced by sex, therefore causing a difference in the pro/anti-inflammatory responses after CNS injury. Here, we review advances highlighting that sex differences in microglia are an important factor in the inflammatory responses that are seen after ischemic injury. We discuss the main differences between microglia in the healthy and diseased developing, adult, and aging brain. We also focus on the dimorphism that exists between males and females in microglial-induced inflammation and energy metabolism after CNS injury. Finally, we describe how all of the current research and literature regarding sex differences in microglia contribute to the differences in poststroke responses between males and females.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Whether PM2.5 alters brain structure and accelerates the preclinical neuropsychological processes remains unknown. Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to examine whether PM2.5 affects the episodic memory decline, and also explored the potential mediating role of increased neuroanatomic risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with exposure. Participants included older females (n = 998; aged 73-87) enrolled in both the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging and the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with annual (1999-2010) episodic memory assessment by the California Verbal Learning Test, including measures of immediate free recall/new learning (List A Trials 1-3; List B) and delayed free recall (short- and long-delay), and up to two brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-06; MRI-2: 2009-10). Subjects were assigned Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores (a brain-MRI measured neuroanatomical risk for Alzheimer's disease), developed by supervised machine learning and validated with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on residential histories and environmental data on air monitoring and simulated atmospheric chemistry, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average PM2.5 exposure preceding MRI-1. In multilevel structural equation models, PM2.5 was associated with greater declines in immediate recall and new learning, but no association was found with decline in delayed-recall or composite scores. For each interquartile increment (2.81 μg/m3) of PM2.5, the annual decline rate was significantly accelerated by 19.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9% to 36.2%] for Trials 1-3 and 14.8% (4.4% to 24.9%) for List B performance, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores, which accounted for 22.6% (95% CI: 1% to 68.9%) and 10.7% (95% CI: 1.0% to 30.3%) of the total adverse PM2.5 effects on Trials 1-3 and List B, respectively. The observed associations remained after excluding incident cases of dementia and stroke during the follow-up, or further adjusting for small-vessel ischaemic disease volumes. Our findings illustrate the continuum of PM2.5 neurotoxicity that contributes to early decline of immediate free recall/new learning at the preclinical stage, which is mediated by progressive atrophy of grey matter indicative of increased Alzheimer's disease risk, independent of cerebrovascular damage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of polyphenol-rich black soybean seed coat extract (BE) on vascular functions and the underlying mechanisms involved. The oral administration of BE at 50 mg per kg body weight to Wistar rats increased NO levels as determined by eNOS phosphorylation. The administration of BE also increased GLP-1 and cAMP levels. Furthermore, the effects of BE were inhibited in the presence of a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. This suggests that GLP-1 is strongly involved in the underlying mechanism of NO production in vivo.

We investigated whether fasting and postprandial serum from BB- or SB-supplemented older adults (60-75 years), taken at baseline or after 45 or 90 days of supplementation, would reduce the production of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers compared to serum from a placebo group, in LPS-stressed HAPI rat microglial cells, in vitro.

Protection was greatest with serum from the 90-day time-point, suggesting that ongoing supplementation may provide the most health benefits. Serum was protective in both fasted and postprandial conditions, indicating that the effects are not only acute and that the meal did not challenge subjects' ability to regulate oxidative and inflammatory stress.

The Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, Chapter 9 describes ethical conduct of research regarding First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples. First Nations Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP®) Principles highlight the necessity of Indigenous engagement and governance. To ensure that the aims and activities of the research being developed are in full and meaningful partnership with Indigenous peoples and communities, community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods provide a process in which full engagement is possible. Research utilizing secondary data sets, such as routinely collected health administrative data, should no longer be excluded from this approach. Our aim was to describe how our research team of academic researchers and a national Indigenous health organization adapted CBPR methods in a research project using previously collected data to examine end-of-life health care service delivery gaps for Indigenous people in Ontario. We describe the process of how we developed our research partnership and how grounding principles and Indigenous ways of knowing guided our work together. Through the adaptation of CBPR methods, our research partnership illustrates a process of engagement that can guide others hoping to conduct Indigenous health research using previously collected data. We also present a transparent research agreement negotiated equally by a national Indigenous health organization and research scientists, which can also be used as a framework for others wishing to establish similar research partnerships.

In this study, we explored the possible role of resveratrol (RSV) at the different dose levels (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, ip) in an experimental model of naphthalene (1 g/kg/day, po)-induced age-related cataracts. Morphological changes in the eyes of the rats in two groups, the RSV and the ARC groups, were monitored weekly, and biochemical parameters in the lenses were assessed after completion of the experimental work. A comparison between the rats in the two groups showed that treatments at RSV doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg/day significantly retarded lenticular opacity, restored antioxidants (CAT, SOD, GPX, GSH), Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase function, and protein contents, and reduced lipid peroxidation in the lenses of the animals in the RSV group. The treatment with resveratrol at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day did not show any anti-cataractogenic effects. Based on the results of our investigation, we conclude that supplemental doses of resveratrol at 40 mg/kg/day effectively prevent cataract formation associated with the aging via increased soluble protein contents and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, apart from the antioxidant restoration. The results demonstrate that RSV treatment may be considered as a promising preventive or supplemental measure for delaying and/or preventing the formation of ARCs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) assay was performed for determination of optimum concentration and incubation time of stingless bee honey. Gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and collagen type Ⅰ (COL1A1) were analyzed using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. Incubation with stingless bee honey at concentration of 0.02% for 72 hr showed significant increase in the viability of human fibroblast cells. Stingless bee honey significantly downregulates metalloproteinase-1 gene expression in both pre-senescence and senescence fibroblast cells and upregulates collagen type Ⅰ gene expression in senescence fibroblast cells. In conclusion, stingless bee honey potentially delayed skin aging through modulation of extracellular matrix genes. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Changes of the extracellular matrix regulation promote skin aging. Stingless bee honey is a good source of natural antioxidant which potentially delays skin aging.

They also protect against many metabolic and ageing-related diseases by dynamically integrating several processes including autophagy, proteostasis, calorie restriction, circadian rhythmicity and metabolism. These sirtuins are therefore important drug targets particularly because they also transduce allosteric signals from sirtuin-activating compounds such as resveratrol into increased healthspan in evolutionarily diverse organisms. While many of these functions are apparently regulated by deacetylation, that mechanism may not be all-encompassing. Since gonadal signals have been shown to regulate ageing/lifespan in worms and flies, the present study hypothesized that these sirtuins may act as intermediary factors for steroid hormone signal transduction. Accordingly, SIRT1 and its orthologues, Sir2 and Sir-2.1, are shown to be veritable nuclear receptor coregulators that classically coactivate the oestrogen receptor in the absence of ligand; coactivation was further increased by 17β-oestradiol. Remarkably in response to the worm steroid hormone dafachronic acid, SIRT1 reciprocally coactivates DAF-12, the steroid receptor that regulates nematode lifespan. These results suggest that steroid hormones may co-opt and modulate a phyletically conserved mechanism of sirtuin signalling through steroid receptors. Hence, it is interesting to speculate that certain sirtuin functions including prolongevity and metabolic regulation may be mechanistically linked to this endocrine signalling pathway; this may also have implications for understanding the determinative role of gonadal steroids such as oestradiol in human ageing. At its simplest, this report shows evidence for a hitherto unknown deacetylation-independent mechanism of sirtuin signalling.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"}

Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest occurring in response to damage and stress and is considered a hallmark of ageing. Senescent cells accumulate in multiple organs during ageing, contribute to tissue dysfunction and give rise to pathological manifestations. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of a variety of human age-related disorders, including cancer, and targeted elimination of these cells has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to ameliorate tissue damage and promote repair and regeneration. In addition, in vivo identification of senescent cells has significant potential for early diagnosis of multiple pathologies. Here, we review existing senolytics, small molecules and drug delivery tools used in preclinical therapeutic strategies involving cellular senescence, as well as probes to trace senescent cells. We also review the clinical research landscape in senescence and discuss how identifying and targeting cellular senescence might positively affect pathological and ageing processes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Understanding biological processes of aging in humans could help maintain a healthy aging trajectory and promote longevity. We performed untargeted plasma metabolomics quantifying 770 metabolites on a cross-sectional cohort of 268 healthy individuals including 125 twin pairs covering human lifespan (from 6 months to 82 years). Unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed 6 main aging trajectories throughout life that were associated with key metabolic pathways such as progestin steroids, xanthine metabolism, and long-chain fatty acids. A random forest (RF) model was successful to predict age in adult subjects (≥16 years) using 52 metabolites (R<sup>2</sup>  = .97). Another RF model selected 54 metabolites to classify pediatric and adult participants (out-of-bag error = 8.58%). These RF models in combination with correlation network analysis were used to explore biological processes of healthy aging. The models highlighted established metabolites, like steroids, amino acids, and free fatty acids as well as novel metabolites and pathways. Finally, we show that metabolic profiles of twins become more dissimilar with age which provides insights into nongenetic age-related variability in metabolic profiles in response to environmental exposure.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Although the incidence of lung cancer in never smokers is rising, this subgroup of patients is underrepresented in genomic studies of lung cancer. Here, we assembled a prospective cohort of 46 never-smoking, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and performed whole-exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing on tumors and matched germline DNA. We observed fewer somatic mutations, genomic breakpoints and a smaller fraction of the genome with chromosomal instability in lung tumors from never smokers compared to smokers. The lower number of mutations, enabled us to identify TSC22D1 as a potential driver gene in NSCLC. On the other hand, the frequency of mutations in actionable genes such as EGFR and ERBB2 and of amplifications in MET were higher, while the mutation rate of TP53, which is a negative prognostic factor, was lower in never smokers compared to smokers. Together, these observations suggest a more favorable prognosis for never smokers with NSCLC. Classification of somatic mutations into six-substitution type patterns or into 96-substitution type signatures revealed distinct clusters between smokers and never smokers. Particularly, we identified in never smokers signatures related to aging, homologous recombination damage and APOBEC/AID activity as the most important underlying processes of NSCLC. This further indicates that second-hand smoking is not driving NSCLC pathogenesis in never smokers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Oxidative stress is an etiological factor that influences numerous diseases, degenerative processes and aging. C. elegans has revealed as an opportune and feasible organism to investigate the antioxidant effects of different bioactives or complex food matrices, and a number of protocols have been developed by using different oxidative stressors. Carotenoids are recognized as quenchers and scavengers of reactive oxygen species, and many of their related health benefits attributed in the diet are tightly linked to their antioxidant properties. In this chapter, we report a simple and rapid assay to evaluate the protection capacity of pure carotenoids or complex carotenoid extracts against oxidative stress in the model system C. elegans. The protocol describes a representative feeding experiment by adding carotenoids to the nematode growth medium and after an incubation period, the C. elegans populations fed with carotenoids are exposed to an acute oxidative stress by using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as oxidative agent. The protection against oxidative stress is evaluated as the survival rate of the nematodes fed with the carotenoid prior to receiving oxidative treatment compared with the survival rate of control nematode population. In order to confirm the carotenoid intake by the nematodes during the feeding experiment a bioassimilation experiment is also reported.</AbstractText>"}

There is a need to identify novel therapies to improve bone mass in these conditions. Previously, we identified age- and sex-dependent effects on bone mass in mice with deletion of the gene encoding the β-galactoside binding lectin, galectin-3 (Lgals3-KO). Due to the influence of sex on the phenotype, we tested the role of sex hormones, estrogen (β-estradiol; E<sub>2</sub>), and androgen (5α-dihydroxytestosterone; DHT) in Lgals3-KO mice. To address this, we subjected male and female wild-type and Lgals3-KO mice to gonadectomy ± E<sub>2</sub> or DHT rescue and compared differential responses in bone mass and bone formation. Following gonadectomy, male and female Lgals3-KO mice had greater cortical bone expansion (increased total area; T.Ar) and reduced loss of bone area (B.Ar). While T.Ar and B.Ar were increased in response to DHT in wild-type mice, DHT did not alter these parameters in Lgals3-KO mice. E<sub>2</sub> rescue more strongly increased B.Ar in Lgals3-KO compared to wild-type female mice due to a failure of E<sub>2</sub> to repress the increase in T.Ar following gonadectomy. Lgals3-KO mice had more osteoblasts relative to bone surface when compared to wild-type animals in sham, gonadectomy, and E<sub>2</sub> rescue groups. DHT suppressed this increase.

The considerable significance of the genetics associated with autism has led to the identification of many risk genes for ASD used for the probing of ASD specificity and shared cognitive features over the past few decades. Identification of ASD risk genes helps to unravel various genetic variants and signaling pathways which are involved in ASD. This review highlights the role of ASD risk genes in gene transcription and translation regulation processes, as well as neuronal activity modulation, synaptic plasticity, disrupted key biological signaling pathways, and the novel candidate genes that play a significant role in the pathophysiology of ASD. The current emphasis on autism spectrum disorders has generated new opportunities in the field of neuroscience, and further advancements in the identification of different biomarkers, risk genes, and genetic pathways can help in the early diagnosis and development of new clinical and pharmacological treatments for ASD.</AbstractText>"}

To unravel the function of ATP and the underlying mechanisms on AD development, APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and wild-type (WT) C57 mice at 6 and 10 months of age were studied. We demonstrated a decreased ATP release in the hippocampus and platelet of APP/PS1 mice, comparing to C57 mice at a relatively early age. Levels of Aβ were raised in both hippocampus and platelet of APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by a decrease of α-secretase activity and an increase of β-secretase activity. Moreover, our results presented an age-dependent rise in mitochondrial vulnerability to oxidation in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we found decreased pSer473-Akt levels, increased GSK3β activity by inhibiting phosphorylation at Ser9 in aged APP/PS1 mice and these dysfunctions probably due to down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Therefore, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway could be involved in Aβ-associated mitochondrial dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice and APP abnormal metabolism in platelet might provide potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Fibrosis is characterized by deposition of excess fibrous material in tissues and organs and is caused by aging, chronic stress, injury, or disease. Myofibroblasts (myoFBs) are fibroblast-like cells that secrete high levels of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in fibrosis. Histological studies have identified many-fold increases of myoFBs in aged organs where myoFBs are constantly generated from resident tissue fibroblasts and other cell types. However, it remains unclear how aging increases the generation of myoFBs. Here, using mice models, and biochemical assays, we show that sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) deficiency plays a major role in aging-associated transformation of fibroblasts to myoFBs, resulting in tissue fibrosis. Our findings suggest that SIRT6-deficient fibroblasts transform spontaneously to myoFB through hyperactivation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in a cell-autonomous manner. Importantly, we noted that SIRT6 haploinsufficiency is sufficient for enhancing myoFb generation, leading to multiorgan fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in mice during aging. Mechanistically, SIRT6 bound to and repressed the expression of key TGF-β signaling genes by deacetylating SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) and Lys-9 and Lys-56 in histone 3 (H3K9 and H3K56, respectively). SIRT6 binding to the promoters of genes in the TGF-β signaling pathway decreased significantly with age and was accompanied by increased binding of SMAD3 to these promoters. Our findings reveal that SIRT6 may be a potential candidate for modulating TGF-β signaling to reduce multiorgan fibrosis during aging and fibrosis-associated diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The pedotransfer functions (PTFs) of desorption rate coefficients of fresh Cd in soils have been developed in literature. We hypothesized that the aging of Cd pollution would alter Cd desorption process. Taking historically polluted soils as the object, this study aimed at testing the hypothesis and developing new PTFs of desorption rate coefficients for historical Cd. 15 d batch extraction experiments and 13 kinetic models were employed to define Cd desorption rate coefficients in 27 historically polluted soil samples. Compared with fresh Cd, the desorption rate coefficients of historical Cd were lower, and the break time of biphasic desorption processes was retarded to 3 d (4320 min). Different with the usual models for fresh Cd desorption (e.g. parabolic diffusion and two constant rate models), the best models to mimic the historical Cd desorption processes were the pseudo first order, logarithmic, Elovich, and simple Elovich models. The rate-limiting step controlling Cd desorption was changed from the intraparticle diffusion to the interface reaction with aging of pollution. New PTFs of desorption rate coefficients of historical Cd were established (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.71). Cd desorption rate coefficients increased with organic matter and clay contents, but decreased with oxalate extractable Fe content, solution pH, cation exchange capacity, and silt content. The key soil properties influencing desorption rate coefficients were not altered by the aging of pollution. The developed PTFs could guide us to adjusting the ecotoxicity and pollution remediation of Cd in historically polluted field soils.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Longevity depends on the maintenance of cellular functionality, and an organism's ability to respond to stress has been linked to functional maintenance and longevity. Stress response pathways might indeed become therapeutic targets of therapies aimed at extending the healthy lifespan. Various progeroid syndromes have been linked to genome instability, indicating an important causal role of DNA damage accumulation in the ageing process and the development of age-related pathologies. Recently, non-cell-autonomous mechanisms including the systemic consequences of cellular senescence have been implicated in regulating organismal ageing.

The <i>Drosophila</i> ovary develops well-defined niches that contain on average 2-4 germline stem cells (GSCs), whose maintenance depends on systemic signals and local factors. A known player in the decline of tissue homeostasis is ageing, which correlates with the waning of resident stem cell populations. In <i>Drosophila</i>, ovaries from old females contain fewer GSCs than those from young flies. We isolated niche cells of aged ovaries, performed a transcriptomic analysis and identified <i>mastermind (mam)</i> as a factor for <i>Drosophila</i> ovarian niche functionality during ageing. We show that <i>mam</i> is upregulated in aged niche cells and that we can induce premature GSC loss by overexpressing <i>mam</i> in otherwise young niche cells. High <i>mam</i> levels in niche cells induce reduced <i>Hedgehog</i> amounts, a decrease in cadherin levels and a likely increase in reactive oxygen species, three scenarios known to provoke GSC loss. Mam is a canonical co-activator of the Notch pathway in many <i>Drosophila</i> tissues.

There are adverse changes in cognitive behavior, perceived sensation and thinking processes. Regular physical activity can alleviate many health problems; yet, many older adults are inactive. Yoga is one of the scientific and popular lifestyle practice considered as the integration of mind, body and soul. Results of previous studies reported positive effects of yoga on multiple health outcomes in elderly. However, there is scarcity of scientific information where yoga's effect is examined on over well-being and on multiple health outcomes simultaneously in elderly. This protocol describes methods for a 12-week yoga-based intervention exploring the effects of yoga on well-being in physically inactive elderly living in community. Methods and analysis: This two group parallel single blind randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at a designated facility of R.D.

In this review, we examine our current understanding of how chronic inflammation and commonly used therapeutic GCs interact to regulate bone and muscle metabolism. Whilst both inflammation and therapeutic GCs directly promote systemic osteoporosis and muscle wasting, the mechanisms whereby they achieve this are distinct. Importantly, their interactions in vivo are greatly complicated secondary to the directly opposing actions of GCs on a wide array of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways that underpin catabolic and anti-anabolic metabolism. Several clinical studies have attempted to address the net effects of therapeutic glucocorticoids on inflammatory bone loss and muscle wasting using a range of approaches. These have yielded a wide array of results further complicated by the nature of inflammatory disease, underlying the disease management and regimen of GC therapy. Here, we report the latest findings related to these pathway interactions and explore the latest insights from murine models of disease aimed at modelling these processes and delineating the contribution of pre-receptor steroid metabolism.

Semi-autonomous vehicles (SAVs) could have the potential to preserve driving independence of this population with high health needs. This paper explores if SAVs could be used as a cognitive assistive device for older aging drivers with cognitive challenges. We illustrate the impact of age-related changes of cognitive functions on driving capacity. Furthermore, following an overview on the current state of SAVs, we propose a model for connecting cognitive health needs of older drivers to SAVs. The model demonstrates the connections between cognitive changes experienced by aging drivers, their impact on actual driving, car sensors' features, and vehicle automation. Finally, we present challenges that should be considered when using the constantly changing smart vehicle technology, adapting it to aging drivers and vice versa. This paper sheds light on age-related cognitive characteristics that should be considered when developing future SAVs manufacturing policies which may potentially help decrease the impact of cognitive change on older adult drivers.</AbstractText>"}

HD is a fatal and pure genetic disease, characterized by chorea, seizures, involuntary movements, dystonia, cognitive decline, intellectual impairment, and emotional disturbances. HD is caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ or CAG) repeats within the exon 1 of the HD gene. HD has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with genetic anticipation. Although the HD gene was discovered 26 years ago, there is no complete understanding of how mutant huntingtin (mHTT) selectively targets medium spiny projection neurons in the basal ganglia of the brain in patients with HD. Several years of intense research revealed that multiple cellular changes are involved in disease process, including transcriptional dysregulation, mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired bioenergetics, defective axonal transport, calcium dyshomeostasis, synaptic damage and caspase, and NMDAR activations. Recent research also revealed that phosphorylated tau and defective GSK-3β signaling are strongly linked to progression of the disease.

However, to date, associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration, such as CSF tau, and APOE-related alterations in ACC cortical thickness (CTH) and CBF have yet to be explored. The current study explored the interaction of CSF tau and APOE genotype (ɛ4+, ɛ4-) on FreeSurfer-derived CTH and arterial spin labeling MRI-measured resting CBF in the ACC (caudal ACC [cACC] and rostral ACC [rACC]) among a sample of 45 cognitively normal older adults. Secondary analyses also examined associations between APOE, CTH/CBF, and cognitive performance. In the cACC, higher CSF tau was associated with higher CTH and lower CBF in ɛ4+, whereas these relationships were not evident in ɛ4-. In the rACC, higher CSF tau was associated with higher CTH for both ɛ4+ and ɛ4-, and with lower CBF only in ɛ4+. Significant interactions of CSF tau and APOE on CTH/CBF were not observed in two posterior reference regions implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Secondary analyses revealed a negative relationship between cACC CTH and executive functioning in ɛ4+ and a positive relationship in ɛ4-.

This was used to develop a theoretical framework for fall prevention for people with dementia. Executive function and motor function are closely related as they share neuroanatomy. This close relationship has been confirmed by observational studies including neuroimaging and intervention studies. Executive function is the cognitive domain most commonly associated with gait dysfunction. Attention, sensory integration, and motor planning are the sub-domains of executive function associated with risk of falls through gait dysfunction, whereas cognitive flexibility, judgement, and inhibitory control affect risk of falls through risk-taking behaviour. Key Messages: Gait, cognition, and falls are closely related. The comorbidity and interaction between gait abnormality and cognitive impairment may underpin the high prevalence of falls in older adults with dementia. Gait assessment and cognitive assessment, particularly executive function, should be integrated in fall risk screening. Assessment results should be interpreted and utilised using a multidisciplinary approach; specific strategies such as customised gait training and behavioural modulation should be considered as part of falls prevention for people with dementia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 S.

The signs of skin aging, such as wrinkles, discolored spots, loss of skin moisture, and disruption of the skin barrier, are mostly caused by inflammatory signaling among various skin layers. The cells on the outermost surface of the skin are keratinocytes; these cells protect the skin against environmental stress and play an important role in immunomodulation by secreting cytokines in response to environmental stress. In the present study, we found that UVB activates STAT1 to mediate inflammatory signaling, yet STAT1 (S272) and STAT (Y702) shows different responses against UVB exposure. Anhua drak tea is a post-fermented dark tea produced in Anhua and Xinhua country in Hunan province of China. Treatment with 2S,3R-6-methoxycarbonylgallocatechin (MCGE), an epigallocatechin gallate derivative isolated from black tea (Anhua dark tea), effectively suppresses STAT1 activation and inflammatory cytokines, and activates Nrf2 pathway to protect cells from reactive oxygen species production in UVB exposed keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). Interestingly, the effects of MCGE were independent on MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, MCGE regulates inflammatory cytokines in monocyte-keratinocyte (THP-1, HaCaT) co-culture and macrophage differentiation models. These results suggest that MCGE potentially can be used as a photoprotective agent against UVB-induced inflammatory responses.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains unclear how age may influence the processing of reward magnitude. Here, with 54 volunteers (22-74 years of age) participating in the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT) with explicit cues ($1, ¢1, or nil) and timed response to win, we characterized brain activations during anticipation and feedback and the effects of age on these regional activations. Behaviorally, age was associated with less reaction time (RT) difference between dollar and cent trials, as a result of slower response to the dollar trials; i.e., age was positively correlated with RT dollar - RT cent, with RT nil as a covariate. Both age and the RT difference ($1 - ¢1) were correlated with diminished activation of the right caudate head, right anterior insula, supplementary motor area (SMA)/pre-SMA, visual cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, right superior/middle frontal gyri, and left primary motor cortex during anticipation of $1 vs. ¢1 reward. Further, these regional activities mediated the age effects on RT differences. In responses to outcomes, age was associated with decreases in regional activations to dollar vs. cent loss but only because of higher age-related responses to cent losses. Together, these findings suggest age-related differences in sensitivity to the magnitude of reward. With lower cerebral responses during anticipation to win large rewards and higher responses to outcomes of small loss, aging incurs a constricted sensitivity to the magnitude of reward.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

One of the major predictions of the free radical theory of aging is that oxidative stress shortens organisms' lifespan because of an increased level of oxidants, which are potentially damaging to macromolecules. However, challenging the role of oxidants in age-related diseases, there is now sufficient evidence that anti-oxidant supplements do not provide any significant health benefits. Interestingly, in addition to an increase in oxidant-mediated macromolecules damage, there is convincing experimental data to support the role for senescent cells in the process of aging. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of oxidants and cellular senescence in organismal aging and propose that, in addition to the role of oxidants as inducers of macromolecular damage, oxidants might also function as regulators of signalling pathways involved in the establishment of cellular senescence. If this role for oxidants is established, it might be necessary to modify the free radical theory of aging from 'Organisms age because cells accumulate reactive oxygen species-dependent damage over time' to: 'Organisms age because cells accumulate oxidants'-dependent damage and oxidants'-dependent senescent characteristics over time'.

The goal here was to determine whether osteocyte PMD formation or repair is affected by aging. Osteocytes from old (24 months) mice developed fewer PMD (-76% females, -54% males) from fluid shear than young (3 months) mice, and old mice developed fewer osteocyte PMD (-51%) during treadmill running. This was due at least in part to decreased pericellular matrix production, as studies revealed that pericellular matrix is integral to formation of osteocyte PMD, and aged osteocytes produced less pericellular matrix (-55%). Surprisingly, osteocyte PMD repair rate was faster (+25% females, +26% males) in osteocytes from old mice, and calcium wave propagation to adjacent nonwounded osteocytes was blunted, consistent with impaired mechanotransduction downstream of PMD in osteocytes with fast PMD repair in previous studies. Inducing PMD via fluid flow in young osteocytes in the presence of oxidative stress decreased postwounding cell survival and promoted accelerated PMD repair in surviving cells, suggesting selective loss of slower-repairing osteocytes. Therefore, as oxidative stress increases during aging, slower-repairing osteocytes may be unable to successfully repair PMD, leading to slower-repairing osteocyte death in favor of faster-repairing osteocyte survival. Since PMD are an important initiator of mechanotransduction, age-related decreases in pericellular matrix and loss of slower-repairing osteocytes may impair the ability of bone to properly respond to mechanical loading with bone formation. These data suggest that PMD formation and repair mechanisms represent new targets for improving bone mechanosensitivity with aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, it remains challenging to achieve efficient RTP from unorthodox luminophores, on account of the unsophisticated understanding of the emission mechanism. Herein, we propose a strategy to realize efficient RTP in nonconventional luminophores through incorporation of lone pairs together with clustering and effective electronic interactions. The former promotes spin-orbit coupling and boosts the consequent intersystem crossing, whereas the latter narrows energy gaps and stabilizes the triplets, thus synergistically affording remarkable RTP. Experimental and theoretical results of urea and its derivatives verify the design rationale. Remarkably, RTP from thiourea solids with unprecedentedly high efficiency of up to 24.5 % is obtained. Further control experiments testify the crucial role of through-space delocalization on the emission. These results will spur the future fabrication of nonconventional phosphors and advance the understanding of the underlying emission mechanism.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In light of recent reports of disease-mirroring EMV molecular signatures, the present study profiled two EMVs from different Parkinson's disease (PD) tissue sources: (a) neural progenitor cells derived from an endogenous adult stem/progenitor cell, called adult human neural progenitor (AHNP) cells, that we found to be pathological when isolated from postmortem PD patients' substantia nigra; and (b) leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene identified patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which were used to isolate EMVs and begin to characterize their cargoes. Initial characterization of EMVs derived from idiopathic patients (AHNPs) and mutant LRRK2 patients showed differences between both phenotypes and when compared with a sibling control in EMV size and release based on Nanosight analysis. Furthermore, molecular profiling disclosed that neurodegenerative-related gene pathways altered in PD can be reversed using gene-editing approaches. In fact, the EMV cargo genes exhibited normal expression patterns after gene editing. This study shows that EMVs have the potential to serve as sensitive biomarkers of disease state in both idiopathic and gene-identified PD patients and that following gene-editing, EMVs reflect a corrected state.

The projection model is adjusted based on the one developed by the GBD Study 2016 SDG collaborators. We found that China has achieved several health-related SDG targets, including decreasing neonatal and under-5 mortality rates and the maternal mortality ratios and reducing wasting and stunting for children. However, China may only achieve 12 out of the 28 health-related SDG targets by 2030. The number of target indicators achieved varies among provinces and municipalities. In 2016, among the seven measured health domains, China performed best in child nutrition and maternal and child health and reproductive health, with the attainment index scores of 93.0 and 91.8, respectively, followed by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) (69.4), road injuries (63.6), infectious diseases (63.0), environmental health (62.9), and universal health coverage (UHC) (54.4).

Poor control of health risk factors and worsening environmental threats have posed difficulties in further health improvement. Meanwhile, an inefficient health system is a barrier to tackling these challenges among such a rapidly aging population. The eastern provinces are predicted to perform better than the central and western provinces, and women are predicted to be more likely than men to achieve these targets by 2030.

We first identified 504 expression dynamic changed genes involved in ccRCC-associated key pathways such as EMT, cell cycle, EGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling. Further analysis identified 229 (90 gene promoters) aberrant expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) and 256 genes with expression quantitative trait copy number (eQTCN) alterations. Among them, FOXM1 was affected by both eQTM and eQTCN. FOXM1 copy number amplification (115/500, 23% of patients), occurred in an amplified peak in chromosome 12q13.3, was enriched in late-stage ccRCC samples and was associated with worse survival. FOXM1-overexpressed pT3 patients with distant metastasis showed ~25% shorter overall survival in both training (log-rank P=0.006) and validation (log-rank P=0.018) cohorts. The eQTM-gene hybrid signature (cg00044170 and FOXM1), superior to either gene expression or DNA methylation alone, showed great potential in diagnosing localized ccRCC in training (area under curve = 0.958) and validation datasets.

Four hierarchical regression models were constructed to explore the effect of each predictor on the outcomes. Aging was associated with NSA asymmetry, but not with the degree of NSA. Age contributed significantly to the variability of all functional performance tests except the 10-m walking speed. The degree of the NSA did not contribute to the prediction of the functional performance tests. However, asymmetry in the NSA added significantly to the prediction of all functional performance tests except the 10-m walking speed.</AbstractText>"}

The present study examined the factors associated with retirement that affect physical activity participation among older adults. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 425 retired Australians aged 60 years and older. Physical activity was assessed objectively, using accelerometers. Two categories of factors affecting physical activity participation following retirement were identified: the various physical and psychological changes in later life that can encourage or discourage physical activity and the adaptation processes undertaken by older people in response to these changes. The adoption of either a gain or loss approach to retirement and aging appeared to be the most influential adaptation factor affecting physical activity participation. The results suggest that intervention approaches should aim to foster more positive attitudes to aging and retirement and promote physical activity at all stages in life.</AbstractText>"}

A high training capacity, regular participation in sporting competitions, and delayed alterations in body composition and physiological capacities have been listed among the main factors contributing to impressive master athletes' performances. However, there is a paucity of data on the metabolism and dietary habits of master athletes, and the question of whether they need to adapt their nutrition to the aging process remains open. Herein, the authors presented a contemporary overview of the metabolic challenges associated with aging, including the risk of low energy availability, anabolic resistance, and periods of metabolic crisis due to forced immobilization.

Here, we explored the consequences of genetic deletion of neurotensin receptor 1 (NtsR1) on METH self-administration and VTA dopamine neuron firing activity. We implanted mice with an indwelling jugular catheter and trained them to nose-poke for intravenous infusions of METH. Mice with NtsR1 deletion (KO) acquired self-administration similar to wildtype (WT) and heterozygous (HET) littermates. However, in NtsR1 KO and HET mice, METH intake and motivated METH seeking decreased when the response requirement was increased to a fixed ratio 3 and when mice were tested on a progressive ratio protocol. After completion of METH self-administration, single cell in vivo extracellular recordings of dopamine firing activity in the VTA were obtained in anesthetized mice. Non-bursting dopamine neurons from KO mice fired at slower rates than those from WT mice, supporting an excitatory role for NtsR1 on VTA dopamine neuronal activity. In WT mice, a history of METH self-administration decreased dopamine cell firing frequency compared with cells from drug-naïve controls. NtsR1 KO and HET mice did not exhibit this decline in dopamine cell firing activity after METH experience. We also observed an increase in population activity following METH self-administration that was strongest in the WT group. Our results suggest a role for NtsR1 in METH-seeking behavior and indicate that ablation of NtsR1 prevents the detrimental effects of prolonged METH self-administration on VTA dopamine cell firing frequency.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Society for the Study of Addiction.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We reported previously that during yeast cell senescence driven by telomere shortening, the telomeric protein Rap1 plays a major role in reprogramming gene expression by relocalizing hundreds of new target genes (called NRTS, for new Rap1 targets at senescence) to the promoters. This leads to two types of histone loss: Rap1 lowers histone level globally by repressing histone gene expression, and it also causes local nucleosome displacement at the promoters of upregulated NRTS. Here, we present evidence of direct binding between Rap1 and histone H3/H4 heterotetramers, and map amino acids involved in the interaction within the Rap1 SANT domain to amino acids 392-394 (SHY). Introduction of a point mutation within the native RAP1 locus that converts these residues to alanines (RAP1<sup>SHY</sup> ), and thus disrupts Rap1-H3/H4 interaction, does not interfere with Rap1 relocalization to NRTS at senescence, but prevents full nucleosome displacement and gene upregulation, indicating direct Rap1-H3/H4 contacts are involved in nucleosome displacement. Consistent with this, the histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 is similarly unnecessary for Rap1 localization to NRTS but is required for full Rap1-mediated nucleosome displacement and gene activation. Remarkably, RAP1<sup>SHY</sup> does not affect the pace of senescence-related cell cycle arrest, indicating that some changes in gene expression at senescence are not coupled to this arrest.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In a laboratory context, an unsuitable diet could confound the interpretation of an RNA interference (RNAi) phenotype, however well-formulated artificial diets can minimize experimental variability, reduce the need for insect handling, and can further be used for roles, such as delivering double-strand RNA (dsRNA)-expressing recombinant bacteria. In this study, artificial diets for oral delivery of dsRNA were developed for two important pest thrips species, western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) and onion thrips (Thrips tabaci), with the goal of (a) stimulating feeding behavior, (b) supporting optimal growth rates of dsRNA-expressing symbiotic bacteria, and (c) nutritionally supporting the thrips for sufficient periods to observe RNAi phenotypes. The efficacy of artificial diets for ingesting 'naked' dsRNA or dsRNA-expressing symbionts and dsRNA delivery via host plant uptake was evaluated. Compared with previously published diet formulations, new combinations based on tryptone, yeast, and soy were superior for enhancing feeding and longevity. However, simply adding 'naked' dsRNA to an artificial diet was an unreliable form of RNAi delivery in our hands due to dsRNA degradation. Delivery via host plants was more successful, and the new diet formulation was suitable for symbiont-mediated dsRNA delivery, which we believe is the most convenient approach for large-scale knockdown experiments. This study, therefore, provides alternative methodologies for thrips rearing, dietary RNAi delivery, and insights into the challenges of performing dietary RNAi in nonmodel insects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This process modifies several tissues with a negative impact on cells physiology, tissues and organs functionality, altering their regeneration capacity. The chronic low-grade inflammation typical of aging, defined as inflammaging, is a common biological factor responsible for the decline and beginning of the disease in age. A murine parabiosis model that combines the vascular system of old and young animals, suggests that soluble factors released by young individuals may improve the regenerative potential of old tissue. Therefore, circulating factors have a key role in the induction of aging phenotype. Moreover, lifestyle can influence the physiological status of multiple organs, via epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, microRNAs are considered potential sensors of aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The oxidative VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ions present in the charged positive electrolyte are the predominant stressor causing loss of functional groups and membrane conductivity. Membrane aging was accelerated in ex situ tests by exploiting elevated temperatures and the increased oxidative strength of Ce<sup>4+</sup>. Acceleration factors were determined on the basis of the analysis of aged radiation grafted g(S-AN) membranes. The degradation in a Ce<sup>4+</sup> solution was found to be ∼4 times faster than in VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>. The highest acceleration factor of ∼200 was found for the degradation with Ce<sup>4+</sup> at 80 °C. The degradation reaction present in the accelerated stress test showed a similar activation energy of ∼50 kJ/mol in VO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup> solutions, suggesting a similar reaction pathway. The applicability of the test was further evaluated with the second membrane, g(AMS-MAN). Its lifetime was estimated based on the accelerated stress test and acceleration factors previously determined for the g(S-AN) membrane and compared to the lifetime projected from an extended cycling experiment in the cell. The two values were in the same range of ∼4000 h. The proposed AST can serve as a basis for predictive modeling of membrane lifetime in vanadium redox flow batteries. The potential of the method and the limitations are discussed.</AbstractText>"}

However, whether DR in mammals is still effective when applied for the first time at old age remains elusive. Here, we report results of a late-life DR switch experiment employing 800 mice, in which 24 months old female mice were switched from ad libitum (AL) to DR or vice versa. Strikingly, the switch from DR-to-AL acutely increases mortality, whereas the switch from AL-to-DR causes only a weak and gradual increase in survival, suggesting a memory of earlier nutrition. RNA-seq profiling in liver, brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) demonstrate a largely refractory transcriptional and metabolic response to DR after AL feeding in fat tissue, particularly in WAT, and a proinflammatory signature in aged preadipocytes, which is prevented by chronic DR feeding. Our results provide evidence for a nutritional memory as a limiting factor for DR-induced longevity and metabolic remodeling of WAT in mammals.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, studies to determine the antioxidant activities of natural foods and their components are also continuing rapidly. Antioxidants have also been replaced in the encapsulation studies used for the preservation and stabilization of food components. Of course, preservation of foods is as important as their production. The latest packaging techniques for food preservation are edible films and coatings. The protective function of edible films and coatings can be improved by the addition of antioxidants. Unlike these, studies on plants and animals have been investigated in vivo in terms of how the antioxidant activity changes as a result of metabolic activities. The role of antioxidant enzymes in these studies is quite large. Many results have been found for the elimination of diseases by either in vivo or in vitro studies regarding antioxidants. Thus, the importance of antioxidants increased with the use in pharmacology, cosmetics and medicine.

Previous research has demonstrated that pre-treatment of BV-2 microglia with walnut extract inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of microglia. As an extension of that study, the effects of walnut-associated fatty acids on BV-2 microglia were assessed. BV-2 murine microglia cells were treated with LA, ALA, or a combination of LA+ALA prior to or after exposure to LPS. Nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in cell-conditioned media. Cyclooxeganse-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were assessed in BV-2 microglia. Both LA and ALA protected against LPS-induced increases in NO, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-alpha when used before LPS exposure. When BV-2 microglia were treated with fatty acids after LPS, only COX-2 and TNF-alpha were significantly attenuated by the fatty acids. There was no synergism of LA+ALA, as the LA+ALA combination was no more effective than LA or ALA alone. Fatty acids, like those found in walnuts, may protect against production of cytotoxic intermediates and cell-signaling molecules from microglia and may prove beneficial for preventing age- or disease-related neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Here we report a chromatin-based mechanism that emerges during the transition from the naive to the primed states of cell pluripotency and reduces, by orders of magnitude, the combinatorial potential in the human cPCDH locus. This mechanism selectively increases the frequency of stochastic selection of a small subset of cPCDH genes after neuronal differentiation in monolayers, 10-month-old cortical organoids and engrafted cells in the spinal cords of rats. Signs of these frequent selections can be observed in the brain throughout fetal development and disappear after birth, except in conditions of delayed maturation such as Down's syndrome.

This HSC-centric view is based largely on studies showing that HSCs from aged mice exhibit these lineage biases following transplantation into irradiated young recipient mice. In this Opinion article, we make the case that the reliance on this approach has led to inaccurate conclusions regarding the effects of ageing on blood-forming stem cells; we suggest instead that changes in the environment contribute to haematopoietic system ageing. We propose that a complete understanding of how ageing affects haematopoiesis depends on the analysis of blood cell production in unperturbed mice. We describe how this can be achieved using in situ fate mapping. This approach indicates that changes in downstream progenitors, in addition to any HSC defects, may explain the reduced lymphopoiesis and sustained myelopoiesis that occur during ageing.</AbstractText>"}

Native monomeric αSyn exists in an intrinsically disordered ensemble of interconverting conformations, which has made its therapeutic targeting by small molecules highly challenging. Nonetheless, here we successfully target the monomeric structural ensemble of αSyn and thereby identify novel drug-like small molecules that impact multiple pathogenic processes. Using a surface plasmon resonance high-throughput screen, in which monomeric αSyn is incubated with microchips arrayed with tethered compounds, we identified novel αSyn interacting drug-like compounds. Because these small molecules could impact a variety of αSyn forms present in the ensemble, we tested representative hits for impact on multiple αSyn malfunctions in vitro and in cells including aggregation and perturbation of vesicular dynamics. We thereby identified a compound that inhibits αSyn misfolding and is neuroprotective, multiple compounds that restore phagocytosis impaired by αSyn overexpression, and a compound blocking cellular transmission of αSyn. Our studies demonstrate that drug-like small molecules that interact with native αSyn can impact a variety of its pathological processes. Thus, targeting the intrinsically disordered ensemble of αSyn offers a unique approach to the development of small molecule research tools and therapeutics for Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Cells from HGPS patients express progerin, a truncated form of Lamin A, which perturbs cellular homeostasis leading to nuclear shape alterations, genome instability, heterochromatin loss, telomere dysfunction and premature entry into cellular senescence. Recently, we reported that telomere dysfunction induces the transcription of telomeric non-coding RNAs (tncRNAs) which control the DNA damage response (DDR) at dysfunctional telomeres. Here we show that progerin-induced telomere dysfunction induces the transcription of tncRNAs. Their functional inhibition by sequence-specific telomeric antisense oligonucleotides (tASOs) prevents full DDR activation and premature cellular senescence in various HGPS cell systems, including HGPS patient fibroblasts. We also show in vivo that tASO treatment significantly enhances skin homeostasis and lifespan in a transgenic HGPS mouse model.

Mutations causative of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease massively map to this hinge point site, underlining the disease relevance of the trilateral salt bridge. A triple charge swap rescues the activity of Fzo1, emphasizing the close coordination of the hinge residues with GTP hydrolysis. Subsequently, ubiquitylation of Fzo1 allows the AAA-ATPase ubiquitin-chaperone Cdc48 to resolve Fzo1 clusters, releasing the dynamin for the next fusion round. Furthermore, cross-complementation within the oligomer unexpectedly revealed ubiquitylated but fusion-incompetent Fzo1 intermediates. However, Cdc48 did not affect the ubiquitylated but fusion-incompetent variants, indicating that Fzo1 ubiquitylation is only controlled after membrane merging.

Lipidomics profiling revealed unusual serum triacylglycerols and phospholipids with ether-bound alkyls in the Calanus group, while ET generally induced shorter-chain triacylglycerols in AT, suggesting increased de novo lipogenesis. The latter was positively associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity. Unexpectedly, insulin-sensitizing lipokines from the family of branched palmitic acid esters of hydroxy stearic acid (PAHSAs) were elevated in both serum and AT after ET, while PAHSAs-containing triacylglycerols were detected in AT. ET stimulated beneficial changes in AT, including PAHSAs synthesis. Although the added value of omega-3 PUFA supplementation was not proven, our discovery can help understand the nature of the metabolic benefits of exercise.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a mitochondrial deacetylase that has emerged as a key regulator of fundamental processes which are frequently dysregulated in aging and related disorders. This review highlights recent advances and controversies regarding the yin and yang functions of SIRT3 in metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the use of SIRT3 modulators as a therapeutic strategy against those disorders. Although most studies point to a protective role upon SIRT3 activation, there are conflicting findings that need a better elucidation. The discovery of novel SIRT3 modulators with higher selectivity together with the assessment of the relative importance of different SIRT3 enzymatic activities and the relevance of crosstalk between distinct sirtuin isoforms will be pivotal to validate SIRT3 as a useful drug target for the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This review aims to summarize the evidence on motor features of depression assessed with instrumental procedures, and examine age-related differences. We included studies investigating posture, balance and gait ascertained with instrumental measurements among individuals with depressive symptoms or disorders. Studies on subjects with specific physical illnesses were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed with the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS) and PRISMA guidelines were followed. 33 studies (13 case-control, five cross-sectional, nine longitudinal and six intervention) with overall low-medium quality were included. Different instruments were employed to assess posture (e.g. digital cameras), balance (balance, stepping platform) or gait (e.g. Six-Minute-Walking Test, instrumented walkways). Results suggest that depression in adults is associated with significant impairments of posture, balance and gait. Motor abnormalities among depressed older adults may depend on the interplay of physical diseases, cognitive impairment and mood. Very few intervention studies measured motor symptoms as outcome. Available evidence suggests, however, that antidepressant drugs and physical exercise may be beneficial for motor abnormalities. Despite the lack of high-quality studies, instrumental assessments confirm the presence and importance of motor abnormalities in depression, with potential age-related differences in their pathophysiology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

However, the genetic mechanisms allowing organisms to maintain host-symbiont associations at the molecular level are still mostly unknown, and in the case of bacterial-animal associations, most genetic studies have focused on adaptations and mechanisms of the bacterial partner. The gutless tubeworms (Siboglinidae, Annelida) are obligate hosts of chemoautotrophic endosymbionts (except for Osedax which houses heterotrophic Oceanospirillales), which rely on the sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for nutrition and growth. Whereas several siboglinid endosymbiont genomes have been characterized, genomes of hosts and their adaptations to this symbiosis remain unexplored.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS'>Here, we present and characterize adaptations of the cold seep-dwelling tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi, one of the longest-lived solitary invertebrates. We sequenced the worm's ~ 688-Mb haploid genome with an overall completeness of ~ 95% and discovered that L. luymesi lacks many genes essential in amino acid biosynthesis, obligating them to products provided by symbionts. Interestingly, the host is known to carry hydrogen sulfide to thiotrophic endosymbionts using hemoglobin. We also found an expansion of hemoglobin B1 genes, many of which possess a free cysteine residue which is hypothesized to function in sulfide binding. Contrary to previous analyses, the sulfide binding mediated by zinc ions is not conserved across tubeworms. Thus, the sulfide-binding mechanisms in sibgolinids need to be further explored, and B1 globins might play a more important role than previously thought. Our comparative analyses also suggest the Toll-like receptor pathway may be essential for tolerance/sensitivity to symbionts and pathogens. Several genes related to the worm's unique life history which are known to play important roles in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and aging were also identified. Last, molecular clock analyses based on phylogenomic data suggest modern siboglinid diversity originated in 267 mya (± 70 my) support previous hypotheses indicating a Late Mesozoic or Cenozoic origins of approximately 50-126 mya for vestimentiferans.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS'>Here, we elucidate several specific adaptations along various molecular pathways that link phenome to genome to improve understanding of holobiont evolution.

In view of this, a mass spectrometry-based high-throughput metabolomic and lipidomic profiling was undertaken of renal cortex samples of three groups of male rats-An 8-month-old Adult group, a 26-month-old Aged group, and a MetR group that also comprised of 26-month-old rats but were subjected to an 80% MetR diet for 7 weeks. Additionally, markers of mitochondrial stress and protein oxidative damage were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Our results showed minor changes during aging in the renal cortex metabolome, with less than 59 differential metabolites between the <i>Adult</i> and <i>Aged</i> groups, which represents about 4% of changes in the kidney metabolome. Among the compounds identified are glycerolipids and lipid species derived from arachidonic acid metabolism. MetR at old age preferentially induces lipid changes affecting glycerophospholipids, docosanoids, and eicosanoids. No significant differences were observed between the experimental groups in the markers of mitochondrial stress and tissue protein damage. More than rejuvenation, MetR seems to induce a metabolic reprogramming.</AbstractText>"}

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) play a pivotal role in regulating the remodeling processes of the vessel wall. Phenotypic switching of VSMC involves oxidative stress-induced extracellular vesicle release, driving calcification processes. The VSMC phenotype is relevant to plaque initiation, development and stability, whereas, in the media, the VSMC phenotype is important in maintaining tissue elasticity, wall stress homeostasis and vessel stiffness. Clinically, assessment of arterial remodeling is a challenge; particularly distinguishing intimal and medial involvement, and their contributions to vessel wall remodeling. The limitations pertain to imaging resolution and sensitivity, so methodological development is focused on improving those. Moreover, the integration of data across the microscopic (i.e., cell-tissue) and macroscopic (i.e., vessel-system) scale for correct interpretation is innately challenging, because of the multiple biophysical and biochemical factors involved. In the present review, we describe the arterial remodeling processes that govern arterial stiffening, atherosclerosis and calcification, with a particular focus on VSMC phenotypic switching. Additionally, we review clinically applicable methodologies to assess arterial remodeling and the latest developments in these, seeking to unravel the ubiquitous corroborator of vascular pathology that calcification appears to be.</AbstractText>"}

We present data showing that the main deleterious consequences are found in young ages compared to adult ones, in terms of movement coordination and learning abilities. Moreover, we obtained sex and age differences in the deleterious effects on these functions and on neuronal layer integrity in growing young rats, while deficient adults presented only slight functional alterations without tissue damage. Actually, the cerebellum and the hippocampus develop and maturate according to different time lap windows and we demonstrate that a switch to a normal diet can only rescue circuits that present a long permissive window of time, such as the cerebellum, whereas the hippocampus does not. Thus, we argue, as others have, for supplements or fortifications given over a longer time than the developmental period.</AbstractText>"}

The precise expression pattern of long noncoding RNA 00899 (LINC00899) in breast cancer and its mechanisms of action have not been reported. Here, we found that LINC00899 is downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated LINC00899 expression is closely associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS) in breast cancer, including the basal, luminal A or luminal B breast cancer subtypes. Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that LINC00899 is closely related to several cancer associated processes, including tight junction- and metabolism-associated pathways. Functional assays indicated that LINC00899 overexpression suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, LINC00899 was found to competitively bind miR-425, thereby functioning as a tumor suppressor by enhancing DICER1. Overexpression of miR-425 attenuated the LINC00899-induced inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These findings highlight the important role of the LINC00899-miR-425-DICER1 axis in breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and could potentially lead to new lncRNA-based diagnostics or therapeutics for breast cancer.</AbstractText>"}

However, the detailed mechanism of lncRNA in LC and whether long non-coding RNAs serve as effective biomarkers remains unclear. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence data of LC and 11 patient clinical traits were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of 9 co-expression modules were identified. The co-expression Pink module significantly correlated with four clinical traits, including history of smoking, lymph node count, tumor status, and the success of follow-up treatment. Based on the co-expression Pink module, lncRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) and lncRNA-RNA binding protein-mRNA networks were constructed. We found that 8 lncRNAs significantly impacted overall survival (OS) in LC patients. These identified lncRNA and hub gene biomarkers were also validated in multiple LC cells <i>in vitro</i> via qPCR.

The algorithm 'cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT)' was applied to estimate the fraction of immune cells in sarcomas. Based on 5 recurrence and OS-associated immune cells (NK cells activated, dendritic cells resting, mast cells resting, mast cells activated and macrophages M1), we constructed a recurrent STS-specific immune cells network. Both nomograms were identified to have good reliabilities (Area Under Curve (AUC) of 5-year survival is 0.724 and 0.773, respectively). Then the co-expression analysis was performed to identify the potential regulation network among recurrent STS-specific immune cells and ceRNAs. Hsa-miR-1226-3p and MUC1 were significantly correlated and dendritic cells resting was related to hsa-miR-1226-3p. Additionally, the expression of MUC1 and dendritic cell marker CD11c were also verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and multidimensional databases. In conclusion, this study illustrated the potential mechanism of hsa-miR-1226-3p regulating MUC1 and dendritic cells resting might play an important role in STS recurrence.

Microtubules are intrinsically polarized, and their orientation, density, and post-translational modifications both respond and contribute to cell polarity. Animal cells that can rapidly reorient their polarity axis, such as fibroblasts, immune cells, and cancer cells, contain radially organized microtubule arrays anchored at the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus, whereas stably polarized cells often acquire non-centrosomal microtubule networks attached to the cell cortex, nucleus, or other structures. Microtubule density, longevity, and post-translational modifications strongly depend on the dynamics of their plus ends. Factors controlling microtubule plus-end dynamics are often part of cortical assemblies that integrate cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and secretion and are subject to microtubule-dependent feedback regulation. Finally, microtubules can mechanically contribute to cell asymmetry by promoting cell elongation, a property that might be important for cells with dense microtubule arrays growing in soft environments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We performed multi-level linear regression analyses to examine whether social expenditure in nine policy areas, minimum pension replacement rates, and unemployment replacement rates explained cross-country differences in post-retirement self-rated health (SRH) and educational inequalities in SRH. In both men and women, a higher total expenditure as well as higher expenditures on health, old age, housing, and 'other social policy areas' (non-categorical cash benefits to low-income households and other social services) were associated with better SRH. Cross-level interactions showed that in the presence of a higher old age expenditure, a higher unemployment expenditure, and a higher total expenditure, the absolute educational inequalities in post-retirement SRH were smaller than with lower expenditures in these areas, in both men and women. We found the same effect in women only for a higher expenditure on health as well as a higher minimum pension replacement rate. A higher expenditure on survivors pensions, a lower expenditure on family, and a higher unemployment replacement rate had this effect in men only.

Primals have been theorized to influence many outcomes of interest to different psychological subdisciplines, and a psychometrically rigorous effort has developed a Primals Inventory to measure them. In this brief report, we aim to introduce primals' potential implications for health psychology research and practice. After summarizing primals' theorized general function, we illustrate their connection to health processes and outcomes via five illustrative hypotheses.

A combined treatment of classical anti-cancer agents and pharmacological SK channel modulators has not been addressed yet. We used the gold-derivative auranofin to induce cancer cell death by targeting thioredoxin reductases in combination with CyPPA to activate SK channels in neuro- and glioblastoma cells. Combined treatment with auranofin and CyPPA induced massive mitochondrial damage and potentiated auranofin-induced toxicity in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. In particular, mitochondrial integrity, respiration and associated energy generation were impaired. These findings were recapitulated in patient-derived glioblastoma neurospheres yet not observed in non-cancerous HT22 cells.

The butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows polyphenism with well-described wet and dry seasonal forms in sub-Saharan Africa, displaying striking morphological, physiological and behavioural differences in response to higher or lower developmental temperatures. During the seasonal transition in the wild, the intermediate phenotype co-occurs with wet and dry phenotypes. In this study, we aimed to characterize the secondary sexually-selected wing traits of the intermediate form to infer its potential fitness compared to wet and dry phenotypes. Among the previously described wing morphological traits, we first showed that the area of the fifth eyespot on the ventral hindwing is the most discriminant trait to identify wet, dry and intermediate phenotypes in both sexes. Second, we characterized the intermediate form for two secondary sexually-selected wing traits: the area and UV reflectance of the dorsal forewing pupil and the composition of the male sex pheromone. We showed that values of these two traits are often between those of the wet and dry phenotypes. Third, we observed increasing male sex pheromone production in ageing dry and wet phenotypes. Our results contrast with previous reports of values for sexually-selected traits in wet and dry seasonal forms, which might be explained by differences in rearing conditions or sample size effects among studies. Wet, dry and intermediate phenotypes display redundant sexually dimorphic traits, including sexually-selected traits that can inform about their developmental temperature in sexual interactions.</AbstractText>"}

Two commonly used measures, derived from DNA methylation, are Horvath-based (Horvath-EAA) and Hannum-based (Hannum-EAA) epigenetic age acceleration. We conducted genome-wide association studies of Horvath-EAA and Hannum-EAA in 13,493 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, to elucidate genetic determinants of differential epigenetic ageing. We identified ten independent SNPs associated with Horvath-EAA, five of which are novel. We also report 21 Horvath-EAA-associated genes including several involved in metabolism (NHLRC, TPMT) and immune system pathways (TRIM59, EDARADD). GWAS of Hannum-EAA identified one associated variant (rs1005277), and implicated 12 genes including several involved in innate immune system pathways (UBE2D3, MANBA, TRIM46), with metabolic functions (UBE2D3, MANBA), or linked to lifespan regulation (CISD2). Both measures had nominal inverse genetic correlations with father's age at death, a rough proxy for lifespan. Nominally significant genetic correlations between Hannum-EAA and lifestyle factors including smoking behaviours and education support the hypothesis that Hannum-based epigenetic ageing is sensitive to variations in environment, whereas Horvath-EAA is a more stable cellular ageing process. We identified novel SNPs and genes associated with epigenetic age acceleration, and highlighted differences in the genetic architecture of Horvath-based and Hannum-based epigenetic ageing measures. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying individual differences in the rate of epigenetic ageing could help explain different trajectories of age-related decline.</AbstractText>"}

After aging in NaOH solution, there were minor changes in the cation-exchange membrane (CEM) properties; however, functional groups (i.e., quaternary amines) on the anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) were converted into benzylic alcohol, alkene, and tertiary amines, respectively, by nucleophilic substitution, Hofmann elimination, and ylide formation. These degradations rendered decreased ion-exchange capacity (IEC), increased electrical resistance, lost hydrophilicity, and weakened mechanical strength. Moreover, severe deteriorations of desalination performance were observed due to the little ion-exchange ability of the degraded AEMs. The desalination rates were restored after cultivating the aged AEMs in acid solution, mainly because the tertiary amines transformed from the hydroxide form (OH-form) to the ionic chlorine form (Cl-form). The restored desalination rates indicated that the main degradation products were tertiary amines. In addition, the antifouling performance decreased in the order of aged OH-form &gt; aged Cl-form &gt; original AEMs due to the reduction of foulant-membrane intermolecular interactions after aging in NaOH solution. The results contribute to establishing a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of alkaline cleaning on IEMs and provide new insights into cleaning-process optimization and membrane modification.</AbstractText>"}

Understanding how these changes influence protein corona formation on nanomaterials is critical for accurately predicting the human exposure risks of aged nanomaterials. Here, we show that sulfidation, a prevalently occurring environmental aging process, of Ag and ZnO nanomaterials significantly affected the protein compositions of the hard corona formed in human saliva, sweat, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, corresponding to three most common exposure pathways, that is, ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation. In particular, a diverse variety of proteins selectively associated with either sulfidized or pristine nanomaterials. Random forest classification of the proteomic data revealed that this selective protein adsorption process was mainly dictated by electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and steric hindrance between proteins and nanomaterials, which were susceptible to the changes in surface charge, hydrophobicity, and aggregation status of nanomaterials induced by sulfidation. Furthermore, even for the proteins that do not exhibit distinct adsorption selectivity between sulfidized and pristine nanomaterials, sulfidation altered the extents of impact of nanomaterials on the conformation and likely functions of the adsorbed proteins. These findings unearth a previously neglected mechanism via which environmental sulfidation process mediates the biological effects of soft-metal-containing nanomaterials.</AbstractText>"}

Regarding the musculoskeletal apparatus, bone fragility induces more susceptibility to fractures, often not accompanied by good ability of self-repairing, in particular when critical-size defects (CSD) occur. Currently orthopedic surgery makes use of allografting and autografting which, however, have limitations due to the scarce amount of tissue that can be taken from the donor, the possibility of disease transmission and donor site morbidity. The need to develop new solutions has pushed the field of tissue engineering (TE) research to study new scaffolds to be functionalized in order to obtain constructs capable of promoting tissue regeneration and achieve stable bone recovery over time. This investigation focuses on the most important aspect related to bone tissue regeneration: the angiogenic properties of the scaffold to be used. As an innovative solution, scleral ossicles (SOs), previously characterized as natural, biocompatible and spontaneously decellularized scaffolds used for bone repair, were tested for angiogenic potential and biocompatibility. To reach this purpose, in ovo Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay (CAM) was firstly used to test the angiogenic potential; secondly, in vivo subcutaneous implantation of SOs (in a rat model) was performed in order to assess the biocompatibility and the inflammatory response. Finally, thanks to the analysis of mass spectrometry (LCMSQE), the putative proteins responsible for the SO angiogenic properties were identified. Thus, a novel natural biomaterial is proposed, which is (i) able to induce an angiogenic response in vivo by subcutaneous implantation in a non-immunodeficient animal model, (ii) which does not induce any inflammatory response, and (iii) is useful for regenerative medicine application for the healing of bone CSD.</AbstractText>"}

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this disorder and its phenotypic heterogeneity, we mimicked the BUBR1L1012P mutation in mice (BubR1L1002P) and combined it with 2 other MVA variants, BUBR1X753 and BUBR1H, generating a truncated protein and low amounts of wild-type protein, respectively. Whereas BubR1X753/L1002P and BubR1H/X753 mice died prematurely, BubR1H/L1002P mice were viable and exhibited many MVA features, including cancer predisposition and various progeroid phenotypes, such as short lifespan, dwarfism, lipodystrophy, sarcopenia, and low cardiac stress tolerance. Strikingly, although these mice had a reduction in total BUBR1 and spectrum of MVA phenotypes similar to that of BubR1H/H mice, several progeroid pathologies were attenuated in severity, which in skeletal muscle coincided with reduced senescence-associated secretory phenotype complexity. Additionally, mice carrying monoallelic BubR1 mutations were prone to select MVA-related pathologies later in life, with predisposition to sarcopenia correlating with mTORC1 hyperactivity. Together, these data demonstrate that BUBR1 allelic effects beyond protein level and aneuploidy contribute to disease heterogeneity in both MVA patients and heterozygous carriers of MVA mutations.</AbstractText>"}

In response, eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated quality control mechanisms to identify, repair and/or eliminate the misfolded abnormal proteins. Chaperones identify any otherwise abnormal conformations in proteins and often help them to regain their correct conformation. However, if repair is not an option, the abnormal protein is selectively degraded to prevent its oligomerization into toxic multimeric complexes. Autophagiclysosomal system and the ubiquitin-proteasome system mediate the targeted degradation of the aberrant protein fragments. Despite the increasing understanding of the molecular counteracting responses toward the accumulation of dysfunctional misfolded proteins, the molecular links between the upstream physiological inputs and the clearance of abnormal misfolded proteins is relatively poorly understood. Recent work has demonstrated that certain physiological states such as vigorous exercise and fasting may enhance the ability of mammalian cells to clear misfolded, toxic and aberrant protein fragments. These findings unveil a novel mechanism that activates the cells' protein-disposal machinery, facilitating the adaptation process of cellular proteome to fluctuations in cellular demands and alterations of environmental cues.

Long-lived mammals appear to possess traits that extend lifespan and healthspan. Genomic analyses have not revealed a single pro-longevity function that would account for all longevity effects. In contrast, it appears that pro-longevity mechanisms may be complex traits afforded by connections between metabolism and protein functions that are impossible to predict by genomic approaches alone. Thus, metabolomics and proteomics studies will be required to understand the mechanisms of longevity. We review several examples that demonstrate the naked mole rat (NMR) shows unique proteomic signatures that contribute to longevity by overcoming several hallmarks of aging. We also discuss SIRT6 as an example of a protein that evolved enhanced enzymatic function in long-lived species. Finally, we show that several longevity related proteins such as Cip1/p21, FOXO3, TOP2A, AKT1, RICTOR, INSR and SIRT6 harbor PTM sites that preferentially appear in either short- or long-lived species and provide examples of crosstalk between PTM sites. We discuss prospects of enhancing lifespan and healthspan of humans by altering metabolism and proteoforms with drugs that mimic changes observed in long-lived species.

Ercc1<sup>-/Δ</sup> mice, carrying one null and one hypomorphic Ercc1 allele, have been widely used to study aging due to accelerated aging phenotypes in numerous organs and their shortened lifespan. Ercc1<sup>-/Δ</sup> mice display combined features of human progeroid and cancer-prone syndromes. Although several studies report cellular senescence and apoptosis associated with the premature aging of Ercc1<sup>-/Δ</sup> mice, the link between these two processes and their physiological relevance in the phenotypes of Ercc1<sup>-/Δ</sup> mice are incompletely understood. Here, we show that ERCC1 depletion, both in cultured human fibroblasts and the skin of Ercc1<sup>-/Δ</sup> mice, initially induces cellular senescence and, importantly, increased expression of several SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) factors. Cellular senescence induced by ERCC1 deficiency was dependent on activity of the p53 tumor-suppressor protein. In turn, TNFα secreted by senescent cells induced apoptosis, not only in neighboring ERCC1-deficient nonsenescent cells, but also cell autonomously in the senescent cells themselves. In addition, expression of the stem cell markers p63 and Lgr6 was significantly decreased in Ercc1<sup>-/Δ</sup> mouse skin, where the apoptotic cells are localized, compared to age-matched wild-type skin, possibly due to the apoptosis of stem cells. These data suggest that ERCC1-depleted cells become susceptible to apoptosis via TNFα secreted from neighboring senescent cells. We speculate that parts of the premature aging phenotypes and shortened health- or lifespan may be due to stem cell depletion through apoptosis promoted by senescent cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, it is still a challenge to identify the biologically relevant targets of RBPs through <i>in vitro</i> strategies of RIP-seq, HITS-CLIP, or GoldCLIP due to the potentially high background and complicated manipulation. In malaria parasites, RIP-seq and gene disruption are the few tools available currently for identification of RBP targets. Here, we have adopted the TRIBE (Targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing) system to <i>in vivo</i> identify the RNA targets of PfDis3, a key exoribonuclease subunit of RNA exosome in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. We generated a transgenic parasite line of <i>PfDis3-ADARcd</i>, which catalyzes an adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) conversion at the potential interacting sites of PfDis3-targeting RNAs. Most of PfDis3 target genes contain one edit site. The majority of the edit sites detected by PfDis3-TRIBE locate in exons and spread across the entire coding regions. The nucleotides adjacent to the edit sites contain ∼75% of A + T. PfDis3-TRIBE target genes are biases toward higher RIP enrichment, suggesting that PfDis3-TRIBE preferentially detects stronger PfDis3 RIP targets. Collectively, PfDis3-TRIBE is a favorable tool to identify <i>in vivo</i> target genes of RBP with high efficiency and reproducibility. Additionally, the PfDis3-targeting genes are involved in stage-related biological processes during the blood-stage development. Thus PfDis3 appears to shape the dynamic transcriptional transcriptome of malaria parasites through post-transcriptional degradation of a variety of unwanted transcripts from both strands in the asexual blood stage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Liu, Lu, Fan, He, Shen, Jiang and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Cigarette smoke (CS) induces airway inflammation in COPD, which is known to persist even after smoking cessation. This review discusses the basic pathogenesis of COPD, with particular focus on an endogenous protective mechanism against oxidative stress via Nrf2, altered immune response of the airway inflammatory cells, exaggerated cellular senescence of the lung structural cells, and cell death with expanded inflammation. Recently, CS-induced mitochondria autophagy is reported to initiate programmed necrosis (necroptosis). Necroptosis is a new concept of cell death which is driven by a defined molecular pathway along with exaggerated inflammation. This new cell death mechanism is of importance due to its ability to produce more inflammatory substances during the process of epithelial death, contributing to persistent airway inflammation that cannot be explained by apoptosis-derived cell death. Autophagy is an auto-cell component degradation system executed by lysosomes that controls protein and organelle degradation for successful homeostasis. As well as in the process of necroptosis, autophagy is also observed during cellular senescence. Aging of the lungs results in the acquisition of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) that are known to secrete inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation. In future research, we intend to highlight the genetic and epigenetic approaches that can facilitate the understanding of disease susceptibility. The goal of precision medicine is to establish more accurate diagnosis and treatment methods based on the patient-specific pathogenic characteristics. This review provides insights into CS-induced COPD pathogenesis, which contributes to a very complex disease. Investigating the mechanism of developing COPD, along with the availability of the particular inhibitors, will lead to new therapeutic approaches in COPD treatment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Kynurenine (KYN) is a circulating tryptophan metabolite that is known to increase with age and is a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). Here, we tested the hypothesis that KYN activation of Ahr plays a role in muscle loss with aging. Results indicate that KYN treatment of mouse and human myoblasts increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2-fold and KYN treatment <i>in vivo</i> reduced muscle size and strength and increased muscle lipid peroxidation in young mice. PCR array data indicate that muscle fiber size reduction with KYN treatment reduces protein synthesis markers whereas ubiquitin ligase gene expression is not significantly increased. KYN is generated by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and aged mice treated with the IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-D-tryptophan showed an increase in muscle fiber size and muscle strength. Small-molecule inhibition of Ahr <i>in vitro</i>, and Ahr knockout <i>in vivo</i>, did not prevent KYN-induced increases in ROS, suggesting that KYN can directly increase ROS independent of Ahr activation. Protein analysis identified very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as a factor activated by KYN that may increase ROS and lipid peroxidation. Our data suggest that IDO inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of sarcopenia and possibly other age-associated conditions associated with KYN accumulation such as bone loss and neurodegeneration.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Helen Kaiser et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The study also evaluated the relationship between meat traits in LT muscle, including color, pigments and lipid oxidation during 7 days of display, α-tocopherol content, intramuscular fat (IMF) content and the fatty acid (FA) profile. Lambs that grazed on alfalfa had a greater α-tocopherol concentration in plasma than CON lambs (P &lt; 0.05). The treatment did not affect the IMF content, meat color or pigments (P &gt; 0.05).

Animals grazing alfalfa had lower expression of desaturase enzymes in the liver (<i>FADS1</i> and <i>FADS2</i>), which regulate unsaturation of fatty acids and are directly involved in the metabolism of n-3 PUFA series. The results found in the current study showed that ingesting diets richer in n-3 PUFA might have negative effects on the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of n-3 PUFA by downregulating the <i>FADS1</i> and <i>FADS2</i> expression.

Current diagnostics (e.g., conventional radiology, biochemical markers), because limited in specificity and sensitivity, can distinguish between healthy or osteoporotic subjects but they are unable to discriminate among different underlying causes that lead to the same bone pathological condition (e.g., bone fracture risk). Among recent, more sensitive biomarkers, miRNAs - the non-coding RNAs involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, have emerged as fundamental post-transcriptional modulators of bone development and homeostasis. Each identified miRNA carries out a specific role in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and functional pathways (osteomiRs). miRNAs bound to proteins or encapsulated in exosomes and/or microvesicles are released into the bloodstream and biological fluids where they can be detected and measured by highly sensitive and specific methods (e.g., quantitative PCR, next-generation sequencing). As such, miRNAs provide a prompt and easily accessible tool to determine the subject-specific epigenetic environment of a specific condition. Their use as biomarkers opens new frontiers in personalized medicine. While miRNAs circulating levels are lower than those found in the tissue/cell source, their quantification in biological fluids may be strategic in the diagnosis of diseases that affect tissues, such as bone, in which biopsy may be especially challenging. For a biomarker to be valuable in clinical practice and support medical decisions, it must be (easily) measurable, validated by independent studies, and strongly and significantly associated with a disease outcome. Currently, miRNAs analysis does not completely satisfy these criteria, however. Starting from <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> observations describing their biological role in bone cell development and metabolism, this review describes the potential use of bone-associated circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for determining predisposition, onset, and development of osteoporosis and bone fracture risk. Moreover, the review focuses on their clinical relevance and discusses the pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical issues in their measurement, which still limits their routine application. Taken together, research and clinical findings may be helpful for creating miRNA-based diagnostic tools in the diagnosis and treatment of bone diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Bottani, Banfi and Lombardi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Age-related decline of tissue homeostasis causes a physiological low-grade chronic inflammatory phenotype known as inflammaging that is involved in many age-related diseases. Activation of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism along the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway prevents hyperinflammation and induces long-term immune tolerance. Systemic Trp and Kyn levels change upon aging and in age-related diseases. Moreover, modulation of Trp metabolism can either aggravate or prevent inflammaging-related diseases. In this review, we discuss how age-related Kyn/Trp activation is necessary to control inflammaging and alters the functioning of other metabolic faiths of Trp including Kyn metabolites, microbiota-derived indoles and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>). We explore the potential of the Kyn/Trp ratio as a biomarker of inflammaging and discuss how intervening in Trp metabolism might extend health- and lifespan.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Sorgdrager, Naudé, Kema, Nollen and Deyn.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Clinical evidence has shown an association of HE with peripheral white blood cells (WBC) count, but the individual contributions of leukocyte subtypes between literatures are described inconsistently. Our aim was to determine the relationship between admission absolute and differential leukocyte counts and HE by using different growth definitions. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed spontaneous ICH patients who underwent baseline cranial computed tomography and blood sampling within 6 h of stroke onset in our institution between September 2013 and August 2018. Hematoma volume was calculated using a semiautomated 3-dimensional reconstruction algorithm. According to commonly used absolute or relative growth definitions (&gt;6 mL, &gt;12.5 mL, or &gt;33%), we defined 5 types of HE. A propensity score-matching analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of complete blood count components on HE across the various growth definitions. The receiver operating characteristic analysis assessed the predictive ability of leukocyte counts for HE. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1,066 patients were included, of whom 11-21% met the 5 HE definitions. After propensity score-matching, except using the definition of &gt;12.5 mL growth or its combination with &gt;33% growth, both WBC and neutrophil count were independently associated with reduced risk of HE (odds ratio [OR] for 10<sup>3</sup> cells increase; OR, 0.86-0.99; all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) after adjusting confounders in multivariate analyses. However, monocyte count was correlated with increased risk of HE under the usage of &gt;12.5 mL expansion definition only (OR, 1.43; <i>p</i> = 0.024). There was no association between lymphocyte count and HE (all <i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Regardless of the growth definition, admission eosinophil count was directly associated with the risk of HE (OR, 6.92-31.60; all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and was the best predictive subtype with area under the curve 0.64, sensitivity 69.5%, and specificity 58.9% at the optimal cut-off value of 45 cells/μL. <b>Conclusions:</b> Growth definition affects the relationship of HE with leukocyte subtypes counting. Eosinophil count robustly predicts HE, and may be a surrogate when using an inflammatory marker to help select acute ICH patients with high expansion risk for hemostasis treatment in clinical trial and practice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Chen, Liu, Xu, He, Li, Jiao, Xiang, Zhan, Chen, Yang, Huang and Yang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Scientists have discovered that the causes of AD may include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, but the exact cause has not yet been elucidated. Effective strategies to prevent and treat AD therefore remain elusive. The identified genetic causes of AD mainly focus on individual genes, but growing evidence has shown that complex diseases are usually affected by the interaction of genes in a network. Few studies have focused on the interactions and correlations between genes and how they are gradually destroyed or disappear during AD progression. A differential network analysis has been recognized as an essential tool for identifying the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and significant genes for prediction analysis. We therefore aim to conduct a differential network analysis to reveal potential networks involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD and identify genes for AD prediction. <b>Methods:</b> In this paper, we selected 365 samples from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, including 193 clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and 172 no cognitive impairment (NCI) controls. Then, we selected 158 genes belonging to the AD pathway (hsa05010) of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We employed a machine learning method, namely, joint density-based non-parametric differential interaction network analysis and classification (JDINAC), in the analysis of gene expression data (RNA-seq data). We searched for the differential networks in the RNA-seq data with a pathological diagnosis of AD. Finally, an optimal prediction model was built through cross-validation, which showed good discrimination and calibration for AD prediction. <b>Results:</b> We used JDINAC to derive a gene co-expression network and to explore the relationship between the interaction of gene pairs and AD, and the top 10 differential gene pairs were identified. We then compared the prediction performance between JDINAC and individual genes based on prediction methods. JDINAC provides better accuracy of classification than the latest methods, such as random forest and penalized logistic regression. <b>Conclusions:</b> The interaction between gene pairs is related to AD and can provide more insight than the individual genes in AD prediction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Chen, He, Ji and Shi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

While there is no consensus regarding the synaptic-relevant species of Aβ, it is known that Aβ oligomers (AβOs) are noticeably increased in the early stages of AD, localizing at or within the synapse. In cell and animal models, AβOs have been shown to attach to synapses and instigate synapse dysfunction and deterioration. To establish the pathological mechanism of synaptic loss in AD, it will be important to identify the synaptic targets to which AβOs attach. <b>Methods:</b> An unbiased approach using far western ligand blots has identified three synaptic proteins to which AβOs specifically attach. These proteins (p100, p140, and p260) were subsequently enriched by detergent extraction, ultracentrifugation, and CHT-HPLC column separation, and sequenced by LC-MS/MS. P100, p140, and p260 were identified. These levels of AβOs targets in human AD and aging frontal cortexes were analyzed by quantitative proteomics and western-blot. The polyclonal antibody to AβOs was developed and used to block the toxicity of AβOs. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. <b>Results:</b> AβOs binding proteins p100, p140, and p260 were identified as Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3, respectively. α3-Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3 proteins showed loss in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of human AD frontal cortex. In short term experiments, oligomers of Aβ inhibited Na/K-ATPase at the synapse. Na/K-ATPase activity was restored by an antibody specific for soluble forms of Aβ. α3-Na/K-ATPase protein and synaptic β-amyloid peptides were pulled down from human AD synapses by co-immunoprecipitation. Results suggest synaptic dysfunction in early stages of AD may stem from inhibition of Na/K-ATPase activity by Aβ oligomers, while later stages could hypothetically result from disrupted synapse structure involving the PSD proteins synGap and Shank3. <b>Conclusion:</b> We identified three AβO binding proteins as α3-Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3. Soluble Aβ oligomers appear capable of attacking neurons via specific extracellular as well as intracellular synaptic proteins. Impact on these proteins hypothetically could lead to synaptic dysfunction and loss, and could serve as novel therapeutic targets for AD treatment by antibodies or other agents.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ding, Zhao, Zhang, Wang, Viola, Chow, Zhang, Lippa, Klein and Gong.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This advantage has been found to be larger in older adults in comparison to younger adults, suggesting that bilingualism provides advantages in cognitive control abilities. However, studies showing this effect have used a variety of tasks (Simon Task, Stroop task, Flanker Task), each measuring different subcomponents of attention and raising mixed results. At the same time, attention is not a unitary function but comprises of subcomponents which can be distinctively addressed within the Attention Network Test (ANT) (1, 2). The purpose of this work was to examine the neurofunctional correlates of the subcomponents of attention in healthy young and elderly bilinguals taking into account the L2 age of acquisition, language usage, and proficiency. Participants performed an fMRI version of the ANT task, and speed, accuracy, and BOLD data were collected. As expected, results show slower overall response times with increasing age. The ability to take advantage of the warning cues also decreased with age, resulting in reduced alerting and orienting abilities in older adults. fMRI results showed an increase in neurofunctional activity in the frontal and parietal areas in elderly bilinguals when compared to young bilinguals. Furthermore, higher L2 proficiency correlated negatively with activation in frontal area, and that faster RTs correlated negatively with activation in frontal and parietal areas. Such a correlation, especially with L2 proficiency was not present in young bilinguals and provides evidence for a bilingual advantage in the alerting subcomponent of attention that characterizes elderly bilinguals' performance. This study thus provides extra details about the bilingual advantage in the subcomponent of attention, in older bilinguals. Consequently, speaking more than one language impacts cognition and the brain later in life.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Dash, Berroir, Joanette and Ansaldo.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, we attempt to demonstrate the validity and reliability of using a consumer game-engine to create software presented on a mobile tablet to assess sensorimotor synchronization, a proxy of rhythmic ability. Our goal was to ascertain whether previously observed research results can be replicated, rather than assess whether a mobile tablet achieves comparable performance to a desktop computer. To achieve this, younger (aged 18-35 years) and older (aged 60-80 years) adult musicians and non-musicians were recruited to play a custom-designed sensorimotor synchronization assessment on a mobile tablet in a controlled laboratory environment. To assess reliability, participants performed the assessment twice, separated by a week, and an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. Results supported the validity of this approach to assessing rhythmic abilities by replicating previously observed results. Specifically, musicians performed better than non-musicians, and younger adults performed better than older adults. Participants also performed best when the tempo was in the range of previously-identified preferred tempos, when the stimuli included both audio and visual information, and when synchronizing on-beat compared to off-beat or continuation (self-paced) synchronization. Additionally, high ICC values (&gt;0.75) suggested excellent test-retest reliability. Together, these results support the notion that consumer electronics running software built with a game engine may serve as a valuable resource for remote, mobile-based data collection of rhythmic abilities.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zanto, Padgaonkar, Nourishad and Gazzaley.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The global phenomenon of population aging raises important questions regarding successful, positive, active, and meaningful aging. Given that aging is often characterized by declines in physical and mental health and increased risk for social isolation and depression, and given that the concept of well-being in old age is both elusive and complex, the present study explored how aging is experienced through a 'bottom-up,' open-ended approach. Thirty-one in-depth semi-structured personal interviews were conducted with adults aged 60 and above in order to explore the question: what concerns older adults in their day-to-day living, and what are their perceived resources? The findings illuminated three prominent themes: (1) central concerns described by the participants as characterizing their experience at this life stage; (2) strategies employed by the participants to cope with concerns and to live a meaningful life in old age; and (3) resources and character strengths that facilitate coping strategies and enable thriving.

We then explain how to implement and test ordinal and disordinal two-way interaction hypotheses in MPT models. We also show how our method generalizes to higher-order interactions involving three or more factors. An empirical example from source memory and aging demonstrates the applicability of this method and allows for directly testing the associative deficit theory that age differences are larger in associative (e.g., source) memory as opposed to item memory.

A higher cognitive reserve (e.g., greater education, occupational attainment, or more leisure activities) is associated with protection against disease-related cognitive decline. Precision medicine aims to optimize the effectiveness of disease prevention and treatment by considering specific biological components of individuals.

Here, we examined the effects of TH status on muscle fiber type, cell signaling, and metabolism in a rabbit model of exercise training - chronic motor nerve stimulation (CMNS). Five rabbits were rendered hypothyroid for 7-8 weeks and three rabbits were made hyperthyroid for 2 weeks prior to CMNS of the left peroneal nerve for 10 days. We then measured markers of muscle fiber type, autophagy, and nutrient- or energy-sensing proteins, and metabolic intermediates. CMNS increased MHC-I expression in hypothyroid rabbits, whereas it was unchanged in hyperthyroid rabbits. CMNS also increased p-AMPK, p-ATGL, CPT-1α, p-Akt, GLUT4, and p-70S6K in hypothyroid rabbits. In contrast, p-AMPK and p-AKT were increased at baseline in hyperthyroid rabbits, but CMNS did not further increase them or any of the other markers. CMNS also increased TCA cycle and acylcarnitine metabolites in hypothyroid rabbits; whereas, acylcarnitines were already elevated in hyperthyroid rabbits, and were only slightly increased further by CMNS. In summary, CMNS effects on cell signaling and metabolism of skeletal muscle were more pronounced in the hypothyroid than the hyperthyroid state. Interestingly, in the hypothyroid state, CMNS caused concomitant activation of two signaling pathways that are usually reciprocally regulated - AMPK and mTOR signaling - which manifested as increased β-oxidation, MHC-I expression, and protein synthesis. Thus, our findings provide insight into the role of TH status on exercise response in muscle. Our observations suggest that TH status of patients may be an important determinant and predictor of their response to exercise training in skeletal muscle.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Parker, White, Lim, Huffman, Ho, Yen and Kraus.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Due to their close evolutionary similarity to humans, non-human primates (NHPs) are of primary interest. Of the NHPs, to date, the gray mouse lemur (<i>Microcebus murinus</i>) has shown promising evidence of its translatability to humans. The present review reports the known advantages and limitations of using this species at all levels of investigation in the context of neuropsychiatric conditions. In this easily bred Malagasy primate with a relatively short life span (approximately 12 years), age-related cognitive decline, amyloid angiopathy, and risk factors (i.e., glucoregulatory imbalance) are congruent with those observed in humans. More specifically, analogous behavioral and psychological symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD/NPS) to those in humans can be found in the aging mouse lemur. Aged mouse lemurs show typical age-related alterations of locomotor activity daily rhythms such as decreased rhythm amplitude, increased fragmentation, and increased activity during the resting-sleeping phase of the day and desynchronization with the light-dark cycle. In addition, sleep deprivation successfully induces cognitive deficits in adult mouse lemurs, and the effectiveness of approved cognitive enhancers such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists is demonstrated in sleep-deprived animals. This result supports the translational potential of this animal model, especially for unraveling the mechanisms underlying dementia and for developing novel therapeutics to prevent age-associated cognitive decline. In conclusion, actual knowledge of BPSD/NPS-like symptoms of age-related cognitive deficits in the gray mouse lemur and the recent demonstration of the similarity of these symptoms with those seen in humans offer promising new ways of investigating both the prevention and treatment of pathological aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Pifferi, Epelbaum and Aujard.</CopyrightInformation>"}

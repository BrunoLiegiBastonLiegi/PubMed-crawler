Furthermore, falls during turning are among the main concerns of community-dwelling elderly population. This study investigates the effect of aging on reactive postural responses to continuous yaw perturbations on a cohort of 10 young adults (mean age 28 ± 3 years old) and 10 older adults (mean age 61 ± 4 years old). Subjects underwent external continuous yaw perturbations provided by the RotoBit<sup>1D</sup> platform. Different conditions of visual feedback (eyes opened and eyes closed) and perturbation intensity, i.e., sinusoidal rotations on the horizontal plane at different frequencies (0.2 Hz and 0.3 Hz), were applied. Kinematics of axial body segments was gathered using three inertial measurement units. In order to measure reactive postural responses, we measured body-absolute and joint absolute rotations, center-of-mass displacement, body sway, and inter-joint coordination. Older adults showed significant reduction in horizontal rotations of body segments and joints, as well as in center-of-mass displacement. Furthermore, older adults manifested a greater variability in reactive postural responses than younger adults. The abnormal reactive postural responses observed in older adults might contribute to the well-known age-related difficulty in dealing with balance control during turning.</AbstractText>"}

The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been adopted for eliciting information in terms of waveform distribution over the scalp. The rationale behind this work is twofold. First, it aims to propose spectral, entropy and temporal biomarkers for emotion identification. Second, it aims to integrate the spectral, entropy and temporal biomarkers as a means of developing spectro-spatial ( S S ) , entropy-spatial ( E S ) and temporo-spatial ( T S ) emotional profiles over the brain regions. The EEGs of 40 healthy volunteer students from the University of Vienna were recorded while they viewed seven brief emotional video clips. Features using spectral analysis, entropy method and temporal feature were computed. Three stages of two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were undertaken so as to identify the emotional biomarkers and Pearson's correlations were employed to determine the optimal explanatory profiles for emotional detection. The results evidence that the combination of applied spectral, entropy and temporal sets of features may provide and convey reliable biomarkers for identifying S S , E S and T S profiles relating to different emotional states over the brain areas. EEG biomarkers and profiles enable more comprehensive insights into various human behavior effects as an intervention on the brain.</AbstractText>"}

In addition to providing a structural integrity, the DEJ also acts as a passageway for molecular transport. Based on the recently reported importance of the DEJ in skin aging, novel peptide derivatives have been tested for their effects on basement membrane (BM) protein expressions in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes. As a result, protein expressions of collagen XVII, laminin and nidogen were stimulated by the test peptide and peptides complex. Further ex vivo evaluation using excised human skin, confirmed that the topical application of the peptides complex significantly increased dermal collagen expression, as well as expressions of collagen XVII and laminin. Interestingly, while the origin of the laminin protein is epidermal keratinocytes, the immunohistochemical staining of skin showed that laminin was only detected in the uppermost layer of the dermis, which suggests a tight assembly of laminin protein onto the dermal side of the DEJ. These results suggest that a peptide complex could improve the structural properties of the DEJ through its ability to stimulate BM proteins. In order to evaluate the anti-wrinkle benefits of the peptide complex in vivo, a clinical study was performed on 22 healthy Asian female volunteers older than 40 years. As a result, significant improvements in skin wrinkles for all of the five sites were observed after two weeks, as assessed by skin topographic measurements. Collectively, these results demonstrate the anti-aging efficacy of the peptides complex.</AbstractText>"}

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), we previously reported mislocalization of the DNA repair nuclear protein BRCA1, its coaggregation with tau, and the possible importance of the subsequent DNA repair dysfunction. However, whether this dysfunction in BRCA1 also occurs in other tauopathies is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether BRCA1 colocalizes with tau aggregates in the cytoplasm in the brains of the patients with tauopathy. We evaluated four AD, two Pick's disease (PiD), three progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), three corticobasal degeneration (CBD), four normal control, and four disease control autopsy brains. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against BRCA1 and phosphorylated tau (AT8). Colocalization was confirmed by immunofluorescence double staining. Colocalization of BRCA1 with tau aggregates was observed in neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in AD, pick bodies in PiD, and globose neurofibrillary tangles and glial coiled bodies in PSP. However, only partial colocalization was observed in tuft-shaped astrocytes in PSP, and no colocalization was observed in CBD. Mislocalization of BRCA1 was not observed in disease controls. BRCA1 was mislocalized to the cytoplasm and colocalized with tau aggregates in not only AD but also in PiD and PSP. Mislocalization of BRCA1 by tau aggregates may be involved in the pathogenesis of PiD and PSP.</AbstractText>"}

Little is known about whether such systems are feasible and effective in providing adequate student water access. This study was a mixed-methods investigation among six schools in an urban district in the U.S. with two types of water delivery systems: (1) tap water infrastructure, with updated water fountains and bottle fillers, and (2) bottled water coolers. We measured students' water consumption and collected qualitative data from students and teachers about their perceptions of school drinking water. Student water consumption was low-between 2.0 (SD: 1.4) ounces per student and 2.4 (SD: 1.1) ounces per student during lunch. Students and teachers reported substantial operational hurdles for relying on bottled water as a school's primary source of drinking water, including difficulties in stocking, cleaning, and maintaining the units. While students and teachers perceived newer bottle filler units positively, they also reported a distrust of tap water. Bottled water delivery systems may not be effective long-term solutions for providing adequate school drinking water access and robust efforts are needed to restore trust in tap water.</AbstractText>"}

Cells that are copying their DNA in preparation for division can suffer from 'replication stress' (RS) due to various external or endogenous impediments that slow or stall replication forks. RS is a major cause of pathologies including cancer, premature ageing and other disorders associated with genomic instability. It particularly affects genomic loci where progression of replication forks is intrinsically slow or problematic, such as common fragile site (CFS), telomeres, and repetitive sequences. Although the eukaryotic cell cycle is conventionally thought of as several separate steps, each of which must be completed before the next one is initiated, it is now accepted that incompletely replicated chromosomal domains generated in S phase upon RS at these genomic loci can result in late DNA synthesis in G2/M. In 2013, during investigations into the mechanism by which the specialized DNA polymerase eta (Pol η) contributes to the replication and stability of CFS, we unveiled that indeed some DNA synthesis was still occurring in early mitosis at these loci. This surprising observation of mitotic DNA synthesis that differs fundamentally from canonical semi-conservative DNA replication in S-phase has been then confirmed, called 'MiDAS'and believed to counteract potentially lethal chromosome mis-segregation and non-disjunction. While other contributions in this Special Issue of <i>Cancers</i> focus on the role of RAS52RAD52 during MiDAS, this review emphases on the discovery of MiDAS and its molecular effectors.</AbstractText>"}

However, the process of aging significantly degrades this ability to maintain protein homeostasis. Consequently, proteins with incorrect conformations are prone to aggregate and accumulate in cells, and this aberrant aggregation of misfolded proteins may trigger various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Here, we investigated the possibilities of suppressing α-synuclein aggregation by using a mutant form of human chaperonin Hsp60, and a derivative of the isolated apical domain of Hsp60 (Hsp60 AD(Cys)). In vitro measurements were used to detect the effects of chaperonin on amyloid fibril formation, and interactions between Hsp60 proteins and α-synuclein were probed by quartz crystal microbalance analysis. The ability of Hsp60 AD(Cys) to suppress α-synuclein intracellular aggregation and cytotoxicity was also demonstrated. We show that Hsp60 mutant and Hsp60 AD(Cys) both effectively suppress α-synuclein amyloid fibril formation, and also demonstrate for the first time the ability of Hsp60 AD(Cys) to function as a mini-chaperone inside cells.

Using an instrumented walkway (GaitRite) as the reference standard, this study compared the validity and reliability of multiple acceleration-derived asymmetry variables. Twenty-five post-stroke participants performed repeated walks over GaitRite whilst wearing a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3) on their lower back, on two occasions, one week apart. Harmonic ratio, autocorrelation, gait symmetry index, phase plots, acceleration, and jerk root mean square were calculated from the acceleration signals. Test-retest reliability was calculated, and concurrent validity was estimated by comparison with GaitRite. The strongest concurrent validity was obtained from step regularity from the vertical signal, which also recorded excellent test-retest reliability (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rho) = 0.87 and Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC<sub>21</sub>) = 0.98, respectively). Future research should test the responsiveness of this and other step asymmetry variables to quantify change during recovery and the effect of rehabilitative interventions for consideration as digital biomarkers to quantify gait asymmetry.</AbstractText>"}

One of these functions is the decrease of oxidative stress and DNA damage due to localisation of the telomerase protein TERT into mitochondria under oxidative stress. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these protective effects are still not well understood. We had shown previously that overexpression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in human fibroblasts results in a decrease of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage after oxidative stress. MtDNA damage caused by oxidative stress is removed via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Therefore we aimed to analyse whether telomerase is able to improve this pathway. We applied different types of DNA damaging agents such as irradiation, arsenite treatment (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) and treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Using a PCR-based assay to evaluate mtDNA damage, we demonstrate that overexpression of hTERT in MRC-5 fibroblasts protects mtDNA from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NaAsO<sub>2</sub> induced damage, compared with their isogenic telomerase-negative counterparts. However, overexpression of <i>hTERT</i> did not seem to increase repair of mtDNA after oxidative stress, but promoted increased levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and forkhead-box-protein O3 (FoxO3a) proteins during incubation in serum free medium as well as under oxidative stress, while no differences were found in protein levels of catalase. Together, our results suggest that rather than interfering with mitochondrial DNA repair mechanisms, such as BER, telomerase seems to increase antioxidant defence mechanisms to prevent mtDNA damage and to increase cellular resistance to oxidative stress. However, the result has to be reproduced in additional cellular systems in order to generalise our findings.</AbstractText>"}

While skeletal muscle properties are known to be highly heritable, evidence regarding the specific genes underpinning this heritability is currently inconclusive. This review aimed to identify genetic variants known to be associated with muscle phenotypes relevant to sarcopenia. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched (from January 2004 to March 2019) using pre-defined search terms such as 'aging', 'sarcopenia', 'skeletal muscle', 'muscle strength' and 'genetic association'. Candidate gene association studies and genome wide association studies that examined the genetic association with muscle phenotypes in non-institutionalised adults aged ≥50 years were included. Fifty-four studies were included in the final analysis. Twenty-six genes and 88 DNA polymorphisms were analysed across the 54 studies. The <i>ACTN3</i>, <i>ACE</i> and <i>VDR</i> genes were the most frequently studied, although the <i>IGF1/IGFBP3</i>, <i>TNFα</i>, <i>APOE</i>, <i>CNTF/R</i> and <i>UCP2/3</i> genes were also shown to be significantly associated with muscle phenotypes in two or more studies. Ten DNA polymorphisms (rs154410, rs2228570, rs1800169, rs3093059, rs1800629, rs1815739, rs1799752, rs7412, rs429358 and 192 bp allele) were significantly associated with muscle phenotypes in two or more studies. Through the identification of key gene variants, this review furthers the elucidation of genetic associations with muscle phenotypes associated with sarcopenia.</AbstractText>"}

Dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of the consumption of 52 food and beverage items, which were assessed by a validated brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. Micronutrient intakes were quantified using the dietary reference intakes score (DRIs-score) for 21 micronutrients (based on DRIs-J 2015). The healthy dietary pattern score was significantly and positively correlated with the intakes of all 21 micronutrients used for constructing the DRIs-score in men and in women (each, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In both sexes, the healthy dietary pattern scores were strongly and positively associated with DRIs-scores (in men: ρ = 0.806, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; in women: ρ = 0.868, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the DRIs-scores reached a plateau around the highest tertile of the healthy dietary pattern score.

Glycation of proteins is a post-translational modification that forms temporary adducts, which, on further crosslinking and rearrangement, form permanent residues known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Cooking at high temperature results in various food products having high levels of AGEs. This review underlines the basis of AGE formation and their corresponding deleterious effects on the body. Glycated Maillard products have a direct association with the pathophysiology of some metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), acute renal failure (ARF), Alzheimer's disease, dental health, allergies, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The most glycated and structurally abundant protein is collagen, which acts as a marker for diabetes and aging, where decreased levels indicate reduced skin elasticity. In diabetes, high levels of AGEs are associated with carotid thickening, ischemic heart disease, uremic cardiomyopathy, and kidney failure. AGEs also mimic hormones or regulate/modify their receptor mechanisms at the DNA level. In women, a high AGE diet directly correlates with high levels of androgens, anti-Müllerian hormone, insulin, and androstenedione, promoting ovarian dysfunction and/or infertility. Vitamin D3 is well-associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS and modulates steroidogenesis. It also exhibits a protective mechanism against the harmful effects of AGEs. This review elucidates and summarizes the processing of infant formula milk and the associated health hazards. Formulated according to the nutritional requirements of the newborn as a substitute for mother's milk, formula milk is a rich source of primary adducts, such as carboxy-methyl lysine, which render an infant prone to inflammation, dementia, food allergies, and other diseases. We therefore recommend that understanding this post-translational modification is the key to unlocking the mechanisms and physiology of various metabolic syndromes.</AbstractText>"}

Risk factors for atherosclerosis include lifestyle and aging. It has been reported that lifespan could be extended in mice by targeting senescent cells, which led to the suppression of aging-related diseases, such as vascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of aging to vascular diseases are still not well understood. Several types of cells, such as vascular (endothelial cell), vascular-associated (smooth muscle cell and fibroblast) and inflammatory cells, are involved in plaque formation, plaque rupture and thrombus formation, which result in atherosclerosis. Gangliosides, a group of glycosphingolipids, are expressed on the surface of vascular, vascular-associated and inflammatory cells, where they play functional roles. Clarifying the role of gangliosides in atherosclerosis and their relationship with aging is fundamental to develop novel prevention and treatment methods for vascular diseases based on targeting gangliosides. In this review, we highlight the involvement and possible contribution of gangliosides to vascular diseases and further discuss their relationship with aging.</AbstractText>"}

In this work, the interfacial reaction between Sn-10Bi solder and Cu substrate after thermal aging was investigated. Moreover, to depress the IMC growth at the interface, trace amounts of Zn was added into the Sn-10Bi solder, and the interfacial reactions of Sn-10Bi-xZn solders (x = 0.2, 0.5) and Cu substrate after thermal aging were studied in this paper. Compounds such as Cu<sub>6</sub>(Sn, Zn)<sub>5</sub> and Cu<sub>5</sub>Zn<sub>8</sub> were formed at the interface after adding trace amounts of Zn. The addition of 0.2 and 0.5 wt% Zn significantly inhibited the thickness growth of IMCs and the formation of Cu<sub>3</sub>Sn IMC at the interface of Sn-10Bi-0.2Zn/Cu and Sn-10Bi-0.5Zn/Cu during thermal aging. Therefore, the addition of trace Zn had an obvious effect on the interfacial reaction of Sn-10Bi/Cu solder joint. Interestingly, the evolution of IMC thickness in Sn-10Bi-0.5Zn/Cu solder joints was completely different from that in Sn-10Bi or Sn-10Bi-0.2Zn solder joints, in which the spalling of IMCs occurred.

OA is a disease process involving multiple joint tissues, including those not visible on radiography, and is a complex disease process with multiple phenotypes that require evaluation by a multimodality imaging assessment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of micro-fragmented fat tissue intra-articular injection 24 months after application in two ways: Indirectly using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment analyzing the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) content in cartilage by means of delayed gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC), as well as clinical outcome on observed level of GAG using standard orthopedic physical examination including VAS assessment. In our previous study assessing comprehensive results after 12 months, the dGEMRIC results have drawn attention. The present study explores the long-term effect of intra-articular injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue to host chondrocytes and cartilage proteoglycans in patients with knee OA. A prospective, non-randomized, interventional, single-center, open-label clinical trial was conducted from January 2016 to April 2018. A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the study, and 32 knees were assessed in a 12-month follow-up, but only 10 patients of them with 18 knees are included in a 24-month follow-up. The rest of the seven patients dropped out of the study 12 months after follow-up: three patients underwent knee arthroplasty, and the remaining four did not fulfil the basic criteria of 24 months involvement in the study. Surgical intervention (lipoaspiration), followed by tissue processing and intra-articular injection of the final microfragmented adipose tissue product into the affected knee(s), was performed in all patients. Patients were assessed for a visual analog scale (VAS), dGEMRIC at the baseline, three, six, 12 and 24 months after the treatment. A magnetic resonance sequence in dGEMRIC due to infiltration of the anionic, negatively-charged contrast gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA2) into the cartilage indicated that the contents of cartilage glycosaminoglycans significantly increased in specific areas of the treated knee joint. Our results suggest that this method of single intra-articular injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue improves GAG content on a significant scale, with over half of the measurements suggesting relevant improvement 24 months after intra-articular injection opposed to the expected GAG decrease over the natural course of the disease.</AbstractText>"}

Here we evaluated the impact of an early stroke lesion on neurogenesis and cognitive function of the aging brain. We hypothesized that a stroke disturbs dentate neurogenesis during aging correlate with impaired flexible learning. To address this issue a stroke was induced in 3-month-old C57Bl/6 mice by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To verify long-term changes of adult neurogenesis the thymidine analogue BrdU (5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) was administrated at different time points during aging. One and half months after BrdU injections learning and memory performance were assessed with a modified version of the Morris water maze (MWM) that includes the re-learning paradigm, as well as hippocampus-dependent and -independent search strategies. After MWM performance mice were transcardially perfused. To further evaluate in detail the stroke-mediated changes on stem- and progenitor cells as well as endogenous proliferation nestin-green-fluorescent protein (GFP) mice were used. Adult nestin-GFP mice received a retroviral vector injection in the hippocampus to evaluate changes in the neuronal morphology. At an age of 20 month the nestin-GFP mice were transcardially perfused after MWM performance and BrdU application 1.5 months later. The early stroke lesion significantly decreased neurogenesis in 7.5- and 9-month-old animals and also endogenous proliferation in the latter group. Furthermore, immature doublecortin (DCX)-positive neurons were reduced in 20-month-old nestin-GFP mice after lesion. All MCAO groups showed an impaired performance in the MWM and mostly relied on hippocampal-independent search strategies. These findings indicate that an early ischemic insult leads to a dramatical decline of neurogenesis during aging that correlates with a premature development of hippocampal-dependent deficits. Our study supports the notion that an early stroke might lead to long-term cognitive deficits as observed in human patients after lesion.</AbstractText>"}

In order to ensure proper optode-to-skin coupling, the probe was equipped with insufflating cuffs. The high number of PPG probes allowed us to simultaneously acquire signals from multiple body locations. The ECG provided a reference for single-pulse PPG evaluation and averaging, allowing the extraction of indices of cardiovascular status with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Firstly, the system was characterized on optical phantoms. Furthermore, in vivo validation was performed by estimating the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a metric associated with cardiovascular status. The validation was performed on healthy volunteers to assess the baPWV intra- and extra-operator repeatability and its association with age. Finally, the baPWV, evaluated via the developed instrumentation, was compared to that estimated with a commercial system used in clinical practice (Enverdis Vascular Explorer).

This complex disease is not caused by a single gene, but resulted from multi-gene interactions, which could be represented by biological networks. Network modules are composed of genes with significant similarities in terms of expression, function and disease association. Therefore, the identification of disease risk modules could contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer. In this paper, an integrated disease risk module identification strategy was proposed according to a multi-objective programming model for two similarity criteria as well as significance of permutation tests in Markov random field module score, function consistency score and Pearson correlation coefficient difference score. Three breast cancer risk modules were identified from a breast cancer-related interaction network. Genes in these risk modules were confirmed to play critical roles in breast cancer by literature review. These risk modules were enriched in breast cancer-related pathways or functions and could distinguish between breast tumor and normal samples with high accuracy for not only the microarray dataset used for breast cancer risk module identification, but also another two independent datasets. Our integrated strategy could be extended to other complex diseases to identify their risk modules and reveal their pathogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Neighborhood type was defined using a geographic information system based on proximity to central service areas and residential density (city center, subcenter, and dense and dispersed areas outside centers). PA was higher in dense areas and the city center. Binary logistic regression showed that perceiving nature-based destinations increased the odds for higher PA in the city center and areas outside centers. In dispersed areas, perceived infrastructure-based facilitators were especially associated with higher PA. Environmental features were not associated with PA in subcenters. Higher residential density, as a proxy for a higher amount of infrastructure, rather than center proximity, may underlie older adults' PA. The spatial context should be acknowledged in studies on environment-PA associations.</AbstractText>"}

Muscle spindle afferent feedback is dependent on changes in muscle length, which can, in turn, modulate corticospinal excitability. Aging is accompanied by several alterations in the nervous system influencing the transmission and integration of sensory information. Thus, this study aimed to assess whether there are age-related differences in corticospinal responses whilst passively changing muscle length. What is the main finding and its importance? In contrast to young, older adults exhibited no modulation of corticospinal excitability in tibialis anterior during passive ankle movement. These data show impaired sensorimotor response in older adults during length changes of tibialis anterior, thus contributing to our understanding of age-related changes in sensorimotor control. ABSTRACT: Corticospinal responses have been shown to increase and decrease with passive muscle shortening and lengthening, respectively, as a result of changes in muscle spindle afferent feedback. The aging sensory system is accompanied by a number of alterations that might influence the processing and integration of sensory information. Consequently, corticospinal excitability might be differently modulated whilst changing muscle length. In 10 older adults (66 ± 4 years), corticospinal responses (MEP/M<sub>max</sub> ) were evoked during a static position, passive shortening, and lengthening of soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA), and these data were compared to the re-analysed data pool of 18 younger adults (25 ± 4 years; Škarabot et al. 2019, Exp Brain Res 237:2239-2254). Resting motor threshold was greater in SOL compared to TA (p &lt; 0.001), but did not differ between young and older (p = 0.405). No differences were observed in MEP/M<sub>max</sub> between the static position, passive shortening or lengthening in SOL (young: all 0.02 ± 0.01; older: 0.05 ± 0.04, 0.03 ± 0.02 and 0.04 ± 0.01, respectively; p = 0.298), and responses were not dependent on age (p = 0.090). Conversely, corticospinal responses in TA were differently modulated between the age groups (p = 0.002), with greater MEP/M<sub>max</sub> during passive shortening (0.22 ± 0.12) compared to passive lengthening (0.13 ± 0.10) and static position (0.10 ± 0.05) in young (p &lt; 0.001), but unchanged in older adults (0.19 ± 0.11, 0.22 ± 0.11 and 0.18 ± 0.07, respectively; p≥0.867). The present experiment shows that length-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability in TA of the young are not evident in older adults. This suggests impaired sensorimotor response during muscle length changes in older age that might only be present in ankle flexors, but not extensors. This article is protected by copyright.

A significant cause of intrinsic aging in women is the loss of estrogen as a result of the onset of menopause.  OBJECTIVE: A single site experience trial to assess the efficacy of Emepelle (Biopelle, Ferndale Pharma Group, Ferndale, MI), a skin care regimen containing Methyl Estradiolpropanoate (MEP)®, for the treatment of Estrogen Deficient Skin (EDS). The secondary objective was to assess patient tolerability and satisfaction.  METHODS: Fourteen female subjects aged 53-68 years who were amenorrheic for 1-10 years (mean, 5 years), with at least a Grade II in Wrinkling (fine to moderate-depth wrinkles, moderate number of lines) and score of at least 5 (of 9; moderate-to-severe) in elastosis on the clinician-assessed Fitzpatrick-Goldman Classification of Wrinkling and Elastosis Scale, and a 3 or greater on the Investigator Facial Skin Hydration Scale, were included in the study. The subjects were instructed to apply the product Emepelle Serum in the morning, and the product Emepelle Night Cream in the evening to the entire freshly washed and dried face. Follow up visits were performed at 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 20 weeks to evaluate efficacy and safety. Canfield Visia Complexion Analysis and standard photography was performed at baseline and at each follow up visit.  RESULTS: On a 0-4 Facial Hydration Scale, 100% of study participants by week 20 showed at least one-grade improvement and 93% saw two grades or more improvement in hydration. 100% of study participants showed aesthetic improvements per investigator-assessed Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at week 14. By week 20, 93% of study participants responded that the combination of Emepelle Serum and Night Cream regimen helped improve wrinkles, texture, and color, and 86% of study participants responded that Emepelle helped improve sun-damage, thickness, and integrity. In the Quality of Life questionnaire, 86% responded that Emepelle helped alleviate some or all of the skin issues they developed since entering menopause.

Frequently these patients present with dry skin, which may benefit from the use of gentle cleansers and moisturizers. A review paper was developed to explore DM-associated skin changes and possible benefits of cleanser and moisturizer use.  METHODS: For this purpose, an expert panel of physicians involved in the care of patients with DM selected information from literature searches coupled with expert opinions and experience of the panel.  RESULTS: A defective skin barrier predisposes the skin to water loss leading to dryness, hyperkeratosis and inflammation. Skin changes that may benefit from the use of gentle cleansers and moisturizers are, amongst others, diabetic foot syndrome, ichthyosiform skin changes, xerosis, and keratosis pilaris. Adherence to treatment is a considerable challenge making education essential, especially about the need to keep skin clean and what skin care to use. Specifically designed diabetic skin care that contains anti-aging ingredients, urea, and essential ceramides, has demonstrated benefits for dry/itchy skin.  CONCLUSIONS: Skin disorders are common complications among either diabetic patients with patients with DM and may lead to serious adverse events. Evidence suggests that daily application of optimal skin care using gentle cleansers and moisturizers is one of the measures that may help improve skin barrier dysfunction, preventing complications by providing early-stage treatment of patients with diabetes.

The main goals of our research consortium are (i) to identify triggers and modifying factors that longitudinally modulate the trajectories of losing and regaining control over drug consumption in real life, (ii) to study underlying behavioral, cognitive, and neurobiological mechanisms, and (iii) to implicate mechanism-based interventions. These goals will be achieved by: (i) using mobile health (m-health) tools to longitudinally monitor the effects of triggers (drug cues, stressors, and priming doses) and modify factors (eg, age, gender, physical activity, and cognitive control) on drug consumption patterns in real-life conditions and in animal models of addiction; (ii) the identification and computational modeling of key mechanisms mediating the effects of such triggers and modifying factors on goal-directed, habitual, and compulsive aspects of behavior from human studies and animal models; and (iii) developing and testing interventions that specifically target the underlying mechanisms for regaining control over drug intake.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

A hallmark of SSc is the remarkable degree of molecular and phenotypic disease heterogeneity, which surpasses that of other complex rheumatic diseases. Disease trajectories in SSc are unpredictable and variable from patient to patient. Disease-modifying therapies for SSc are lacking, long-term morbidity is considerable and mortality remains unacceptably high. Currently-used empirical approaches to disease modification have modest and variable clinical efficacy and impact on survival, are expensive and frequently associated with unfavorable side effects, and none can be considered curative. However, research during the past several years is yielding significant advances with therapeutic potential. In particular, the application of unbiased omics-based discovery technologies to large and well-characterized SSc patient cohorts, coupled with hypothesis-testing experimental research using a variety of model systems is revealing new insights into SSc that allow formulation of a more nuanced appreciation of disease heterogeneity, and a deepening understanding of pathogenesis. Indeed, we are now presented with numerous novel and rationally-based strategies for targeted SSc therapy, several of which are currently, or expected to be shortly, undergoing clinical evaluation. In this review, we discuss promising novel therapeutic targets and rationally-based approaches to disease modification that have the potential to improve long-term outcomes in SSc.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

SQSTM1 was originally identified by a candidate gene approach because it encodes p62, a multifunctional protein involved in protein degradation both through proteasomal regulation and autophagy. Both p62 and optineurin (encoded by OPTN) are direct interaction partners and substrates of TBK1, and these 3 proteins form the core of a genetic and functional network that may connect autophagy with ALS. Considering the molecular and conceptual relevance of the TBK1/OPTN/SQSTM1 'triangle,' we here performed a targeted screen for SQSTM1 variants in 486 patients with familial ALS from Germany and Sweden by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data. We report 9 novel and 5 previously reported rare variants in SQSTM1 and discuss the current evidence for SQSTM1 as a primary disease gene for ALS.

Previously, we identified a novel TFEB activator named curcumin analog C1 which directly binds to and activates TFEB. In this study, we systematically investigated the efficacy of curcumin analog C1 in three AD animal models that represent beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathology (5xFAD mice), tauopathy (P301S mice) and the APP/Tau combined pathology (3xTg-AD mice). We found that C1 efficiently activated TFEB, enhanced autophagy and lysosomal activity, and reduced APP, APP C-terminal fragments (CTF-β/α), β-amyloid peptides and Tau aggregates in these models accompanied by improved synaptic and cognitive function. Knockdown of TFEB and inhibition of lysosomal activity significantly inhibited the effects of C1 on APP and Tau degradation in vitro.

We identified a bivalent combination, a dually marked H3K9me3/H3K14ac modification in the liver, that is significantly decreased in old hepatocytes. Subsequent sequential ChIP-Seq identified dually marked single nucleosome regions, with reduced number of sites and decreased signal in old livers, confirming mass spectrometry results. We detected H3K9me3 and H3K14ac bulk ChIP-Seq signal in reChIP nucleosome regions, suggesting a correlation between H3K9me3/H3K14ac bulk bivalent genomic regions and dually marked single nucleosomes. Histone H3K9 deacetylase Hdac3, as well as H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1, found in complex Kap1, occupied both bulk and single nucleosome bivalent regions in both young and old livers, correlating to presence of H3K9me3. Expression of genes associated with bivalent regions in young liver, including those regulating cholesterol secretion and triglyceride synthesis, is upregulated in old liver once the bivalency is lost. Hence, H3K9me3/H3K14ac dually marked regions define a poised inactive state that is resolved with loss of one or both of the chromatin marks, which subsequently leads to change in gene expression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Longitudinal research among individuals of the general population suggests that frailty predicts future cognitive decline; however, there is limited evidence for these longitudinal relationships among people living with HIV (PLWH). The current study evaluated and compared rates of cognitive decline over 2 years among HIV serostatus and frailty status groups. Participants included 50 PLWH and 60 HIV-uninfected (HIV-) participants who were evaluated at baseline and 2-year follow-up visits. Baseline frailty status (non-frail, pre-frail, and frail) was determined using fried frailty phenotype criteria. Neurocognitive functioning was measured using practice-effect corrected scaled scores derived from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery covering seven cognitive domains. Repeated measures analysis was used to estimate rates of global and domain-specific cognitive change from baseline to 2-year follow-up among each of six HIV/frailty status groups. Among PLWH, the pre-frail group demonstrated consistent declines in global cognitive functioning (B = - 0.029, p = 0.034), processing speed (B = - 0.047, p = 0.031), and motor functioning (B = - 0.048, p = 0.038). Among HIV- participants, pre-frail individuals also declined in global cognitive functioning and processing speed (ps ≤ 0.05). HIV- non-frail participants also declined in the cognitive domains of learning, delayed recall, and motor functioning; however, these declines appeared to be driven by relatively higher baseline scores among this group. Notably, 38% of PLWH changed in frailty status from baseline to follow-up, and those with stable pre-frailty demonstrated higher likelihood for cognitive decline; change in depressive symptoms did not relate to change in frailty status. Current findings highlight pre-frailty as an important clinical syndrome that may be predictive of cognitive decline among PLWH. Interventions to prevent or reduce frailty among vulnerable PLWH are needed to maintain optimal cognitive health.</AbstractText>"}

However, there is large heterogeneity in current data, possibly due to effect modifiers such as physical activity, sex and muscle group. Yet, few studies have compared multiple muscle groups in different age groups with comparable physical activity levels. Here, we newly used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to characterise mitochondrial capacity in three different locomotor muscles in young (19-25 year) and older (65-71 year), healthy males with similar physical activity levels. Mitochondrial capacity and reperfusion after arterial occlusion was measured in the vastus lateralis (VL), the gastrocnemius (GA) and the tibialis anterior (TA). Physical activity was verified using accelerometry and was not different between the age groups (404.3 ± 214.9 vs 494.9 ± 187.0 activity kcal per day, p = 0.16). Mitochondrial capacity was significantly lower in older males in the GA and VL, but not in the TA (p = 0.048, p = 0.036 and p = 0.64, respectively). Reperfusion rate was not significantly different for the GA (p = 0.55), but was significantly faster in the TA and VL in the young group compared to the older group (p = 0.0094 and p = 0.039, respectively). In conclusion, we identified distinct modes of mitochondrial ageing in different locomotor muscles in a young and older population with similar physical activity patterns. Furthermore, we show that NIRS is suitable for relatively easy application in ageing research and can reveal novel insights into mitochondrial functioning with age.</AbstractText>"}

Here we propose an innovative approach, based on individual risk-taking preference, to identify neural profiles that may help predict older adults' everyday decision-making capacity. Using performance and cognitive arousal information from two gambling tasks, we identified three decision-making preference groups: ambiguity problem-solvers (A), risk-seekers (R), and a control group without strong risk-taking preferences (C). Comparisons of the number of connections within white matter tracts between A vs. C and R vs. C groups resulted in features consistent with the theory of dual neural functional systems involved in decision-making. Unique tracts from the A vs. C contrast were primarily centered in dorsal frontal regions/reflective system; unique tracts from the R vs. C contrast were centered in the ventral frontal regions/impulsive system; and shared tracts from both contrasts were centered in the basal ganglia, coordinating the switch between the two types of decision-making preference. Number of connections from the tracts differentiating A vs. C significantly predicted financial and health/safety decision-making capacity, and the association remained significant after controlling for multiple socioeconomic and cognitive factors. The connectome identified may provide insight into a generic white matter mechanism related to everyday decision-making capacity in older age.</AbstractText>"}

Falls are the most common cause of injury, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all traumas in this population. Trauma to the thorax represents the second most common site of injury in this population, and is often associated with other serious injuries. Mortality rates are 2-5 times higher in older adults compared to their younger counterparts, often despite equivalent injury severity scores. Risk scoring systems have been developed to identify rib fracture patients at high risk of deterioration. Overall mortality from rib fractures is high, at approximately 10% for all ages. Mortality and morbidity from rib fractures primarily derive from pain-induced hypoventilation, pneumonia and respiratory failure. The main goal of care is therefore to provide sufficient analgesia to allow respiratory rehabilitation and prevent pulmonary complications. The provision of analgesia has evolved to incorporate novel regional anaesthesia techniques into conventional multimodal analgesia. Analgesia algorithms may aid early aggressive management and escalation of pain control. The current role for surgical fixation of rib fractures remains unclear for older adults who have been underrepresented in the research literature. Older adults with rib fractures often have multi-morbidity and frailty which complicate their injuries. Trauma services are evolving, and increasingly geriatricians will be embedded into trauma services to deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment. This review aims to provide an evidence-based overview of the management of rib fractures for the physician treating older patients who have sustained trauma.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

{"PMID":31858090,"Title":"Precursor-Independent Overproduction of Beta-Amyloid in AD: Mitochondrial Dysfunction as Possible Initiator of Asymmetric RNA-Dependent βAPP mRNA Amplification. An Engine that Drives Alzheimer's Disease.","Journal":"Annals of integrative molecular medicine","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Alzheimer’s disease, Mitochondrial dysfunction, RNA-dependent βAPP mRNA amplification, Therapeutic strategies","Abstract":"<AbstractText>The present study defines RNA-dependent amplification of βAPP mRNA as a molecular basis of beta-amyloid overproduction in Alzheimer's disease. In this process, βAPP mRNA serves as a template for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp complex. The resulting antisense RNA self-primes its extension utilizing two complementary elements: 3'-terminal and internal, located within an antisense segment corresponding to the coding portion of βAPP mRNA. The extension produces 3'-terminal fragment of βAPP mRNA, a part of a hairpin-structured antisense/sense RNA molecule. Cleavage at the 3' end of the hairpin loop produces RNA end product encoding a C-terminal fragment of βAPP. Since each conventional βAPP mRNA can be used repeatedly as a template, the process constitutes an asymmetric mRNA amplification. The 5'-most translation initiation codon of the amplified mRNA is the AUG preceding immediately and in-frame the Aβ-coding segment. Translation from this codon overproduces Aβ independently of βAPP. Such process can occur in humans but not in mice and other animals where segments of βAPP antisense RNA required for self-priming have little, if any, complementarity. This explains why Alzheimer's disease occurs exclusively in humans and implies that βAPP mRNA amplification is requisite in AD. In AD, therefore, there are two pathways of beta-amyloid production: βAPP proteolytic pathway and βAPP mRNA amplification pathway independent of βAPP and insensitive to beta-secretase inhibition. This implies that in healthy humans, where only the proteolytic pathway is in operation, Aβ production should be suppressed by the BACE inhibition, and indeed it is. However, since βAPP-independent pathway operating in AD is by far the predominant one, BACE inhibition has no effect in Alzheimer's disease. It appears that, physiologically, the extent of beta-amyloid overproduction sufficient to trigger amyloid cascade culminating in AD requires asymmetric RNA-dependent amplification of βAPP mRNA and cannot be reached without it. In turn, the occurrence of mRNA amplification process depends on the activation of inducible components of RdRp complex by certain stresses, for example the ER stress in case of amplification of mRNA encoding extracellular matrix proteins. In case of Alzheimer's disease, such an induction appears to be triggered by stresses associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, a phenomenon closely linked to AD. The cause-and-effect relationships between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD appear to be very different in familial, FAD, and sporadic, SAD cases. In FAD, increased levels or more toxic species of Aβ resulting from the abnormal proteolysis of βAPP trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, activate mRNA amplification and increase the production of Aβ, reinforcing the cycle. Thus in FAD, mitochondrial dysfunction is an intrinsic component of the amyloid cascade. The reverse sequence is true in SAD where aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction activates amplification of βAPP mRNA and enhances the production of Aβ. This causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, the cycle repeats and degeneration increases. Thus in SAD, the initial mitochondrial dysfunction arises prior to the disease, independently of and upstream from the increased Aβ production, i.e. in SAD, mitochondrial pathology hierarchically supersedes Aβ pathology. This is the primary reason for the formulation of the Mitochondrial Cascade Hypothesis. But even in terms of the MCH, the core of the disease is the amyloid cascade as defined in the amyloid cascade hypothesis, ACH. The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to this core is causative in SAD and auxiliary in FAD. In FAD, the initial increase in the production of Aβ is mutations-based and occurs relatively early in life, whereas in SAD it is coerced by an aging-contingent component, but both lead to mechanistically identical self-perpetuating mutual Aβ/mitochondrial dysfunction feedback cycles, an engine that drives, via RNA-dependent βAPP mRNA amplification, overproduction of beta-amyloid and, consequently, AD; hence drastic difference in the age of onset, yet profound pathological and symptomatic similarity in the progression, of familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, the recent findings that mitochondrial microprotein PIGBOS interacts with the ER in mitigating the unfolded protein response indicate a possible connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, implicated in activation of RNA-dependent mRNA amplification pathway. The possible involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in βAPP mRNA amplification makes it a promising therapeutic target. Recent successes in mitigating, and even reversing, Aβ-induced metabolic defects with anti-diabetes drug metformin are encouraging in this respect.</AbstractText>"}

In the addition of PAPI, its molecular weight and viscosity dramatically increased, while its relative solubility, hydroxyl number, and cloud point exhibited an opposite direction, showing an increase in hydrophobicity. After adding the above modified demulsifier, a remarkably improved water removal of WACO emulsion accompanied by a notable reduction of the water content in the oil phase monitored by the Karl Fischer method was observed. Demulsification on the offshore platform demonstrated that the best water removal was achieved when the proportion of PAPI is 1.5 wt %. Its demulsification efficiency reached 95.7%, which was 25.6% higher than the 76.2% of unmodified demulsifier. In addition, a positive correlation between viscoelasticity of emulsion and demulsification performance was found by only adjusting the parameters of the rheometer. This method may be utilized to characterize the demulsification performance by any rotary rheometer. The pilot-scale demulsification experiment demonstrated that the water removal can reach 98.14 vol % and residual water content was only 0.55 vol %. These results further confirmed the excellent demulsification performance of the modified demulsifier toward the WACO emulsion in production.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Lifestyle changes increase the burden of chronic diseases and disability. These have important implications for social protection systems. The goal of this paper is to model future functional disability and healthcare expenditures based on current trends. To project the health, disability and hospitalization spending of future elders, we adapted the Future Elderly Model (FEM) to Singapore. The FEM is a dynamic Markov microsimulation model developed in the US. Our main source of population data was the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) consisting of 63,000 respondents followed up over three waves from 1993 to 2010. The FEM model enables us to investigate the effects of disability compounded over the lifecycle and hospitalization spending, while adjusting for competing risk of multi-comorbidities. Results indicate that by 2050, 1 in 6 elders in Singapore will have at least one ADL disability and 1 in 3 elders will have at least one IADL disability, an increase from 1 in 12 elders and 1 in 5 elders respectively in 2014. The highest prevalence of functional disability will be in those aged 85 years and above. Lifetime hospitalization spending of elders aged 55 and above is US$24,400 (30.2%) higher among people with functional disability compared to those without disability. Policies that successfully tackle diabetes and promote healthy living may reduce or delay the onset of disability, leading to potential saving.

Altered structural connectivity may be both a neurobiological vulnerability for, and a result of, PTSD. In an effort to find reliable effects, we present a multi-cohort analysis of dMRI metrics across 3047 individuals from 28 cohorts currently participating in the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD working group (a joint partnership between the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis consortium). Comparing regional white matter metrics across the full brain in 1426 individuals with PTSD and 1621 controls (2174 males/873 females) between ages 18-83, 92% of whom were trauma-exposed, we report associations between PTSD and disrupted white matter organization measured by lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the tapetum region of the corpus callosum (Cohen's d = -0.11, p = 0.0055). The tapetum connects the left and right hippocampus, for which structure and function have been consistently implicated in PTSD. Results were consistent even after accounting for the effects of multiple potentially confounding variables: childhood trauma exposure, comorbid depression, history of traumatic brain injury, current alcohol abuse or dependence, and current use of psychotropic medications. Our results show that PTSD may be associated with alterations in the broader hippocampal network.</AbstractText>"}

We hypothesized that mechanical trauma accelerates aging by deformation of membrane proteins to cause binding of naturally occurring IgG. RBCs isolated from blood of healthy volunteers were exposed to high shear stress in a viscometer or microfluidics channel to mimic mechanical trauma and then incubated with autologous plasma. Increased binding of IgG was observed indicating forces caused conformational changes in a membrane protein exposing an epitope(s), probably the senescent cell antigen of band 3. The binding of immunoglobulin suggests it plays a role in the premature sequestration and phagocytosis of RBCs in the spleen. Measurement of IgG holds promise as a marker foreshadowing complications in cardiovascular patients and as a means to improve the design of medical devices in which RBCs are susceptible to sublethal trauma.</AbstractText>"}

Thus, there is a need to better understand the immediate immune response to injury and how this might influence important patient outcomes such as multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In this study, we have assessed the immune response to trauma in 61 patients at three different post-injury time points (ultra-early (&lt;=1 h), 4-12 h, 48-72 h) and analysed relationships with the development of MODS. We developed a pipeline using Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Elastic Net feature selection methods that were able to identify 3 physiological features (decrease in neutrophil CD62L and CD63 expression and monocyte CD63 expression and frequency) as possible biomarkers for MODS development. After univariate and multivariate analysis for each feature alongside a stability analysis, the addition of these 3 markers to standard clinical trauma injury severity scores yields a Generalized Liner Model (GLM) with an average Area Under the Curve value of 0.92 ± 0.06. This performance provides an 8% improvement over the Probability of Survival (PS14) outcome measure and a 13% improvement over the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) for identifying patients at risk of MODS.</AbstractText>"}

Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which is required for mtDNA release, has been extensively studied in apoptotic cells, but little is known about its role in live cells. We found that oxidatively stressed mitochondria release short mtDNA fragments via pores formed by the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) oligomers in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, the positively charged residues in the N-terminal domain of VDAC1 interact with mtDNA, promoting VDAC1 oligomerization. The VDAC oligomerization inhibitor VBIT-4 decreases mtDNA release, IFN signaling, neutrophil extracellular traps, and disease severity in a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, inhibiting VDAC oligomerization is a potential therapeutic approach for diseases associated with mtDNA release.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This plasticity is mediated by large dynamin-related GTPases, called mitofusins in the case of fusion between two mitochondrial outer membranes. Fusion requires ubiquitylation, attached to K398 in the yeast mitofusin Fzo1, occurring in atypical and conserved forms. Here, modelling located ubiquitylation to α4 of the GTPase domain, a critical helix in Ras-mediated events. Structure-driven analysis revealed a dual role of K398. First, it is required for GTP-dependent dynamic changes of α4. Indeed, mutations designed to restore the conformational switch, in the absence of K398, rescued wild-type-like ubiquitylation on Fzo1 and allowed fusion. Second, K398 is needed for Fzo1 recognition by the pro-fusion factors Cdc48 and Ubp2. Finally, the atypical ubiquitylation pattern is stringently required bilaterally on both involved mitochondria. In contrast, exchange of the conserved pattern with conventional ubiquitin chains was not sufficient for fusion. In sum, α4 lysines from both small and large GTPases could generally have an electrostatic function for membrane interaction, followed by posttranslational modifications, thus driving membrane fusion events.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Schuster et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Behavioral studies show that FE recognition ability decreases with aging. Studying how event-related brain oscillations change with normal aging is important to better understand the underlying mechanisms of emotional processes. The aim of this study is to investigate changes in FE recognition due to normal aging using the EEG-Brain Oscillations approach. Fifteen young and fifteen elderly healthy subjects were included in the study. 15 photographs were used with 5 different FEs (angry, happy, neutral, sad, fearful). After each EEG recording session, subjects were asked to identify the FEs that were presented. Event-related delta, theta and, alpha phase-locking and frequency-band responses were analyzed. In the FE recognition part of the study, young subjects obtained better scores than the elderly subjects. There was a significant result regarding the locationXgroup comparison in the delta response; the young group had a higher delta response than the elderly group over the occipital area. There were significant locationXgroup differences in the theta and alpha phase locking values; the elderly group had higher theta and alpha phase locking values than the young group in the frontal area. Group differences were significant in the theta response and theta phase locking; the elderly individuals' theta response and phase locking values were higher compared to those of the young individuals. In elderly individuals, FE recognition impairment has been observed. It has been shown that the impairment may be characterized by decreased occipital delta responses and phase locking. This can be interpreted to mean that elderly individuals may have developed different brain dynamics as a compensating mechanism since they are not as efficient as young individuals in performing these functions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In response, the National Hartford Center of Gerontological Nursing Excellence commissioned the development of core competencies and a recognition program for educators in gerontological nursing. The goal of these competencies is to promote quality instruction in the care of older adults by describing a set of preferred skills characterizing faculty teaching gerontological content to nursing and interprofessional learners. These educator-focused competencies can guide individual career development for new and current educators who specialize in teaching about the care of older adults.

No differentially methylated regions were identified between the OGPA and YGPA groups. Further, when assessing only the sites previously shown to be altered by age, no statistically significant differences between OGPA and YGPA were identified. This was true even despite the lower bar for significance after removing multiple comparison correction in a targeted approach.

When resources are absent and periods of starvation occur in early life, such developmental stress often influences key life-history traits in a way that benefits individuals and their offspring when facing further bouts of starvation. Here we investigated the impacts of different starvation regimes during larval development on life-history traits and measures of consumption in the turnip sawfly, Athalia rosae (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae). We then assessed whether offspring of starved and non-starved parents differed in their own life-history if reared in conditions that either matched that of their parents or were a mismatch. Early life starvation effects were more pronounced within than across generations in A. rosae, with negative impacts on adult body mass and increases in developmental time, but no effects on adult longevity in either generation. We found some evidence of higher growth rates in larvae having experienced starvation, although this did not ameliorate the overall negative effect of larval starvation on adult size. However, further work is necessary to disentangle the effects of larval size and instar from those of starvation treatment. Finally, we found weak evidence for transgenerational effects on larval growth, with intra-generational larval starvation experience being more decisive for life-history traits.

Forty-five, 10-week old TRAMP mice were randomized to either receive free access to the running wheel, Nexrutine pelleted into chow at 600 mg/kg or no treatment control. Mice were serially sacrificed at weeks 4, 8,12 and 20 weeks. Palpable tumors, body weight, food consumption and running wheel activity were monitored weekly. At necropsy, tumors and serum were harvested and stored for analysis. Serum was used to quantify circulating cytokines in 4 and 20 week time points. Nexrutine supplementation led to a 66% protection against high grade tumors. Exercise resulted in a 60% protection against high grade tumors. Both interventions reduced concentrations of IL-1α. Exercise also significantly lowered concentrations of eotaxin, IL-5, IL-12(p40) and VEGF. While there were no significant differences at baseline, exercise mice had significantly lower IL-5 and VEGF compared to control at the 20 week time point. Nexrutine also significantly reduced circulating IL-9 concentrations. No significant differences were observed when compared to the control group. Immunohistochemistry of tumor sections showed significantly lower expression of pAkt in Nexrutine fed mice with no visible differences for NFκB. In conclusion, both Nexrutine and exercise suppressed tumor growth. Though similar outcomes were seen in this comparative effectiveness study, the mechanisms by which exercise and Nexrutine exert this benefit may focus on different pathways.</AbstractText>"}

Successful implementation of CRM relies on good understandings of the kinetics and mechanism of controlled release of reactive agents. In this study, batch experiments and model simulations were conducted to explore the impacts of CRM properties (composition and size) and environmental conditions (temperature, pH, water volume and anions) on KMnO<sub>4</sub> release from KMnO<sub>4</sub> -paraffin controlled release beads. Experimental results indicated that higher KMnO<sub>4</sub>: paraffin mass ratio resulted in shorter release longevities and higher release rate. Larger bead resulted in lower release rate, longer release longevity, and more KMnO<sub>4</sub> released. Higher incubation temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity, but did not affect the total mass of KMnO<sub>4</sub> released. Acidic pH decreased the total mass of KMnO<sub>4</sub> released while alkaline pH did not affect KMnO<sub>4</sub> release. The presence of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and Br<sup>-</sup> had negligible impacts on KMnO<sub>4</sub> release. A dissolution-diffusion conceptual model was developed. The above experimental observation and the associated controlled release mechanisms can be qualitatively explained by the conceptual model. A more detailed two-film boundary mathematical model was developed to simulate KMnO<sub>4</sub> release process. Comparison of modeling results with experimental data suggest that the new mathematical model gave a good quantitatively predication. Overall, this study shows that properly designed CRM can sustain release for years, thus representing a cost-effective and low-maintenance groundwater remediation technology. Both CRM properties and environmental conditions significantly affect the release kinetics and longevity, therefore these factors should be considered in the design and maintenance of CRM-based ISCO system.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is imperative to understand the aggregation behaviours that determine the transport and fate of nanoplastics in aquatic environments. In this study, the effects of various metal cations, pH, aging and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the aggregation of polystyrene nanoplastics (nano-PS) in aqueous solutions were systematically evaluated based on aggregation kinetics experiments and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theoretical calculation. The concentration, valence and hydration ability of metal cations jointly affected the aggregation of nano-PS. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of nano-PS was significantly higher than the ionic strengths in aquatic environments, indicating that the aggregation rate of nano-PS is relatively low in aquatic environments. The results of the aggregation kinetics experiments were consistent with DLVO theory, which showed that the energy barrier of nano-PS was dependent on electrostatic repulsion forces and van der Waals forces, and increased with pH. Nano-PS was artificially aged by UV-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which reduced the hydrophobic nature of the particle surfaces, consequently enhancing the stability of the nanoplastics. EPS (excreted from Chlorella pyrenoidosa) decreased the aggregation rates of nano-PS due to steric effects, which was confirmed by the extend DLVO model. Our results highlight the high stability of nano-PS in aquatic environments, which could help facilitate the evaluation of their environmental impact.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A change in wellness-illness status is interpreted through personal beliefs about depression, and the knowledge, skills and resources required to optimise well-being. Successful transitions were associated with improved experience and management of depression. The findings have implications for how older adults recognise and respond to symptoms of depression.

Under one-third of stroke survivors reporting emotional problems receive support. The aim of this study was to explore the process of emotional adjustment post-stroke and investigate the role played by participation in an online stroke community. We applied thematic analysis to 124 relevant posts within 114 discussion threads, written by 39 survivors and 29 carers. The contribution of online community engagement to emotional adjustment was explored using the Social Support Behaviour Code. Stroke survivors share common experiences of emotional adjustment and may not necessarily reach complete acceptance. Positive and negative trajectories of emotional adjustment were identified. Survivors progressed along, or moved between, positive and negative pathways not in a time-dependent manner but in response to 'trigger events,' such as physical setbacks or anti-depressant treatment, which may occur at any chronological time. An adapted version of Suhr's 1990 Social Support Behaviour Code showed that support provided through the online community took many forms, including advice, teaching, empathy and normalization of concerns. Participation in the stroke community was itself deemed to be a positive 'trigger event.'

Defects in genes involved in guarding genome stability cause several human progeroid syndromes, and an age-dependent accumulation of mutations has been observed in different organisms, from yeast to mammals. However, it is unclear whether the spontaneous mutation rate changes during aging and whether specific pathways are important for genome maintenance in old cells. We developed a high-throughput replica-pinning approach to screen for genes important to suppress the accumulation of spontaneous mutations during yeast replicative aging. We found 13 known mutation suppression genes, and 31 genes that had no previous link to spontaneous mutagenesis, and all acted independently of age. Importantly, we identified PEX19, encoding an evolutionarily conserved peroxisome biogenesis factor, as an age-specific mutation suppression gene. While wild-type and pex19Δ young cells have similar spontaneous mutation rates, aged cells lacking PEX19 display an elevated mutation rate. This finding suggests that functional peroxisomes may be important to preserve genome integrity specifically in old cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In addition, these exceptional aging athletes can serve as a role model for the promotion of physical activity at all ages. The study of masters athletes has provided useful insight into the positive example of successful aging. To further establish and propagate masters athletics as a role model for our aging society, future research and action are needed. © 2020 American Physiological Society.

Previous studies demonstrated that biphasic electrical stimulation (ES) stimulates bone formation; however, polyimide electrode should be removed after regeneration. This study presents an implantable electrical stimulation bioreactor with electrodes based on liquid crystal polymer (LCP), which can be permanently implanted due to excellent biocompatibility to bone tissue. The bioreactor was implanted into a critical-sized bone defect and subjected to ES for one week, where bone regeneration was evaluated four weeks after surgery using micro-CT. The effect of ES via the bioreactor was compared with a sham control group and a positive control group that received recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 (20 μg). New bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) in the ES and rhBMP-2 groups increased to 132% (p &lt; 0.05) and 174% (p &lt; 0.01), respectively, compared to that in the sham control group. In the histological evaluation, there was no inflammation within the bone defects and adjacent to LCP in all the groups.

As an important basis for diagnosing heart disease and evaluating heart function, the electrocardiogram (ECG) records cardiac physiological electrical activity. Abnormalities in cardiac physiological activity are directly reflected in the ECG. Thus, ECG research is conducive to heart disease diagnosis. Considering the complexity of arrhythmia detection, we present an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate classification. Compared with the traditional machine learning methods, CNN requires no additional feature extraction steps due to the automatic feature processing layers. In this paper, an improved CNN is proposed to automatically classify the heartbeat of arrhythmia. Firstly, all the heartbeats are divided from the original signals. After segmentation, the ECG heartbeats can be inputted into the first convolutional layers. In the proposed structure, kernels with different sizes are used in each convolution layer, which takes full advantage of the features in different scales. Then a max-pooling layer followed. The outputs of the last pooling layer are merged and as the input to fully-connected layers. Our experiment is in accordance with the AAMI inter-patient standard, which included normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats (V), fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). For verification, the MIT arrhythmia database is introduced to confirm the accuracy of the proposed method, then, comparative experiments are conducted. The experiment demonstrates that our proposed method has high performance for arrhythmia detection, the accuracy is 99.06%. When properly trained, the proposed improved CNN model can be employed as a tool to automatically detect different kinds of arrhythmia from ECG.</AbstractText>"}

Included studies were identified through a systematic search using electronic databases and manual literature review to identify randomized studies published between June 1972 and March 2019. Thirty two studies were identified and used to analyse the effects of low and high protein gestational diets on litter size, litter weight, gestational weight gain, and gestational feed intake. The results indicate that low protein diets significantly reduced litter weight (p&lt;0.00001) and gestational weight gain (p&lt;0.0006), but did not influence litter size (p=0.62) or gestational feed intake (p=0.25). In contrast, high protein diets were found to reduce gestational feed intake (p=0.004) but did not influence litter size (p=0.56), litter weight (p=0.22) or gestational weight gain (p=0.35). The results suggest that low but not high protein gestational diets alter reproductive outcomes at birth in rats.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, printed hydrogels typically lack the requisite mechanical properties and functionality of the desired tissue, limiting application and, more importantly, safety and efficacy of the implant. The study authors have developed an innovative nanoclay-based bioink to print high shape fidelity functional constructs for potential skeletal application. Laponite® (LAP) nanoclay was combined with gellan gum (GG) to generate a printable hydrogel that was highly stable <i>in vitro,</i> displayed limited swelling ability compared with the silicate-free control and remained stable over time. An agarose fluid gel was found to provide the requisite support for the deposition of the material ink and preservation of the printed structure before crosslinking. Printed C2C12 myoblasts remained viable and displayed extensive proliferation over 21 days in culture. Cell-laden scaffolds demonstrated functionality within 1 day of culture <i>in vitro</i> and that was preserved over 3 weeks. Analysis of absorption and release mechanisms from LAP-GG using model proteins (lysozyme and bovine serum albumin) demonstrated the retention capability of the clay-based materials for compound localisation and absence of burst release.

The results indicated that in the co-culture group, <i>Lactobacillus</i> adhered to sperm cells in numbers that were 332-fold higher than those of control species <i>Enterococcus</i> and analysis of sequencing data using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes indicated that adhered microbes reduced sperm cell motility.

The affected epithelium accumulates somatic mutations in multiple genes that are related to IL-17 signalling-including NFKBIZ, ZC3H12A and PIGR, which are genes that are rarely affected in colon cancer. Targeted sequencing validates the pervasive spread of mutations that are related to IL-17 signalling.

We recently reported that the deletion of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which converts Angiotensin II to Angiotensin-(1-7) in mice, leads to the early manifestation of aging-associated muscle weakness along with the increased expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, a senescence-associated gene, and increased central nuclei in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in middle age. As ACE2 is multifunctional and functions beyond its role in the RAS, we investigated whether activation of the RAS primarily contributes to muscle weakness in ACE2 knockout (KO) mice by comparing these mice to Tsukuba hypertensive (TH) mice that overproduce human angiotensin II. The grip strength of young (6 months) and middle-aged (15 months) TH mice was consistently lower than that of wild-type mice at the same ages. Middle-aged TH mice were continuously lean with extremely reduced adiposity. Central nuclei in the gastrocnemius (GM) muscle were increased in ACE2KO mice, while no apparent morphological change was observed in the GM muscles of TH mice. Increased expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> along with alterations in the expression of several sarcopenia-associated genes were observed in the GM muscles of ACE2KO mice but not TH mice. These findings suggest that chronic overactivation of the RAS does not primarily contribute to the early aging phenotypes of skeletal muscle in ACE2KO mice.</AbstractText>"}

GM2+ cells showed a higher growth rate than GM2- cells in the adherent condition. When GM2- and GM2+ cells were cultured three-dimensionally, almost all cells in the spheres expressed GM2, including cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells. A glycolipid synthesis inhibitor reduced GM2 expression and TGF-β1 signaling in these CSC-like cells, presumably by inhibiting the interaction between GM2 and TGFβ RII and suppressing invasion. Furthermore, suppression of GM2 expression by MAPK inhibition also reduced TGF-β1 signaling and suppressed invasion. GM2+ cells formed larger subcutaneous tumors at a high incidence in nude mice than did GM2- cells. In PDAC cases, GM2 expression was significantly associated with younger age, larger tumor size, advanced stage and higher histological grade. These findings suggest that GM2 could be used as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for PDAC.</AbstractText>"}

We tested multisensory processes in a large sample of 2920 older adults to assess whether sensory ability mediates age-related changes in perception. Participants completed a test of audio-visual integration, the Sound Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI), alongside measures of visual (acuity, contrast sensitivity, self-reported vision and visual temporal discrimination (VTD)) and auditory (self-reported hearing and auditory temporal discrimination (ATD)) function. Structural equation modelling showed that SIFI susceptibility increased with age. This was mediated by visual acuity and self-reported hearing: better scores on these measures predicted reduced and stronger SIFI susceptibility, respectively. Unexpectedly, VTD improved with age and predicted increased SIFI susceptibility. Importantly, the relationship between age and SIFI susceptibility remained significant, even when considering mediators. A second model showed that, with age, visual 'gain' (the benefit of congruent auditory information on visual judgements) was predicted by ATD: better ATD predicted stronger visual gain. However, neither age nor SIFI susceptibility were directly associated with visual gain. Our findings illustrate, in the largest sample of older adults to date, how multisensory perception is influenced, but not fully accounted for, by age-related changes in unisensory abilities.</AbstractText>"}

Surgical treatments are sometimes effective; however, the treatment of back pain related to IVD degeneration is still a challenge; therefore, new treatments are necessary. Apoptosis may be important in IVD degeneration because suppressing cell apoptosis inside the IVD inhibits degeneration. Caspase-3, the primary effector of apoptosis, may be a key treatment target. We analyzed caspase-3's role in two different types of IVD degeneration using caspase-3 knockout (Casp-3 KO) mice. Casp-3 KO delayed IVD degeneration in the injury-induced model but accelerated it in the age-induced model. Our results suggest that this is due to different pathological mechanisms of these two types of IVD degeneration. Apoptosis was suppressed in the IVD cells of Casp-3 KO mice, but cellular senescence was enhanced. This would explain why the Casp-3 KO was effective against injury-induced, but not age-related, IVD degeneration. Our results suggest that short-term caspase-3 inhibition could be used to treat injury-induced IVD degeneration.</AbstractText>"}

Treatment outcome was assessed by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (self-report), administered three times before treatment to control for time and regression artifacts, and posttreatment. Venipunctures were performed twice before treatment, separated by 9 weeks, and once posttreatment. Telomerase activity and telomere length were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and GPx activity in plasma. All patients contributed with complete data. Results showed that social anxiety symptom severity was significantly reduced from pretreatment to posttreatment (Cohen's d = 1.46). There were no significant alterations in telomeres or cellular protection markers before treatment onset. Telomere length and telomerase activity did not change significantly after treatment, but an increase in telomerase over treatment was associated with reduced social anxiety. Also, lower pretreatment telomerase activity predicted subsequent symptom improvement. GPx activity increased significantly during treatment, and increases were significantly associated with symptom improvement. The relationships between symptom improvement and putative protective enzymes remained significant also after controlling for body mass index, sex, duration of SAD, smoking, concurrent psychotropic medication, and the proportion of lymphocytes to monocytes.

In addition, the connected drug pairs tended to have a similar structure. By inferring the functions of lncRNAs through their co-expressing mRNAs, we found that lncRNA functions related to the modular interface were associated with the mode of action or side effects of the corresponding connected drugs, suggesting that lncRNAs may directly/indirectly participate in specific biological processes after drug administration. Finally, we investigated the tissue-specificity of drug-affected lncRNAs and found that some kinds of drugs tended to have a broader influence (e.g. antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs), whereas some tissue-specific lncRNAs (nervous system) tended to be affected by multiple types of drugs.</AbstractText>"}

Stimulated platelets express leukocyte adhesion molecules and release numerous immune modulatory factors that recruit and activate leukocytes, both at the sites of activation and distantly. Monocytes are innate immune cells with dynamic immune modulatory functions that change during the aging process, a phenomenon termed 'inflammaging'. We have previously shown that platelets are a major source of plasma beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) and that β2M induced a monocyte pro-inflammatory phenotype. Plasma β2M increases with age and is a pro-aging factor. We hypothesized that platelet derived β2M regulates monocyte phenotypes in the context of aging. Using wild-type (WT) and platelet specific β2M knockout mice (Plt-β2M<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, we found that plasma β2M increased with age and correlated with increased circulating Ly6C<sup>Hi</sup> monocytes. However, aged Plt-β2M<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly fewer Ly6C<sup>Hi</sup> monocytes compared to WT mice. Quantitative real-time PCR of circulating monocytes showed that WT mouse monocytes were more 'pro-inflammatory' with age, while Plt-β2M<sup>-/-</sup> derived monocytes adopted a 'pro-reparative' phenotype. Older Plt-β2M<sup>-/-</sup> mice had a significant decline in heart function compared to age matched WT mice, as well as increased cardiac fibrosis and pro-fibrotic markers. These data suggest that platelet-derived β2M regulates age associated monocyte polarization, and a loss of platelet derived β2M shifted monocytes and macrophages to a pro-reparative phenotype and increased pro-fibrotic cardiac responses. Platelet regulation of monocyte phenotypes via β2M may maintain a balance between inflammatory and reparative signals that affects age related physiologic outcomes.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we assessed the ability of tf-fMRI to isolate reproducible networks critical for specific language functions and often damaged in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). First, we performed whole-brain seed-based correlation analyses on tf-fMRI data to identify ICNs anchored in regions known for articulatory, phonological, and semantic processes in healthy male and female controls (HCs). We then evaluated the reproducibility of these ICNs in an independent cohort of HCs, and recapitulated their functional relevance with a post-hoc meta-analysis on task-based fMRI. Lastly, we investigated whether atrophy in these ICNs could inform the differential diagnosis of nonfluent/agrammatic, semantic, and logopenic PPA variants. The identified ICNs included a dorsal articulatory-phonological network involving inferior frontal and supramarginal regions; a ventral semantic network involving anterior middle temporal and angular gyri; a speech perception network involving superior temporal and sensorimotor regions; and a network between posterior inferior temporal and intraparietal regions likely linking visual, phonological, and attentional processes for written language. These ICNs were highly reproducible across independent groups and revealed areas consistent with those emerging from task-based meta-analysis. By comparing ICNs' spatial distribution in HCs with patients' atrophy patterns, we identified ICNs associated with each PPA variant. Our findings demonstrate the potential use of tf-fMRI to investigate the functional status of language networks in patients for whom activation studies can be methodologically challenging.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>We showed that a single, short, task-free fMRI acquisition is able to identify four reproducible and relatively segregated intrinsic left-dominant networks associated with articulatory, phonological, semantic, and multimodal orthography-to-phonology processes, in healthy controls.

Collectively, our results support the application of task- free fMRI in future research to study functionality of language circuits in patients for whom tasked- based activation studies might be methodologically challenging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Its central nervous system is particularly interesting, because in certain stages of metamorphosis the spinal cord can regenerate after injury and recover swimming. With this in mind, automatic gait analysis could help evaluate the regenerative performance by means of a method that automatically and quantitatively establishes the degree in froglets' limb movement. Here, we present an algorithm that characterizes spinal cord damage in froglets. The proposed method tracks the position of the limbs throughout videos and extracts kinematic features, which posteriorly serve to differentiate froglets with different levels of damage to the spinal cord. The detection algorithm and kinematic features chosen were validated in a pattern recognition experiment in which 90 videos (divided equally in three classes: uninjured, hemisected and transected) were classified. We conclude that our system is effective in the characterization of damage to the spinal cord through video analysis of a swimming froglet with a 97% accuracy. These results potentially validate this methodology to automatically compare the recovery of spinal cord function after different treatments without the need to manually process videos. In addition, the procedure could be used to measure the kinematics and behavioral response of froglets to different experimental conditions such as nutritional state, stress, genetic background and age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to hypertension, but specific mechanisms are unclear. The mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 is critical in the regulation of metabolic and antioxidant functions which are associated with hypertension, and cardiovascular disease risk factors diminish Sirt3 level. <b>Objective:</b> We hypothesized that reduced Sirt3 expression contributes to vascular dysfunction in hypertension but increased Sirt3 protects vascular function and decreases hypertension. <b>Methods and Results:</b> To test the therapeutic potential of targeting Sirt3 expression we developed new transgenic mice with global Sirt3 overexpression (Sirt3OX) which protects from endothelial dysfunction, vascular oxidative stress and hypertrophy, attenuates angiotensin II- and DOCA-salt induced hypertension. Global Sirt3 depletion in <i>Sirt3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice results in oxidative stress due to SOD2 hyperacetylation, increases HIF1α, reduces endothelial cadherin, stimulates vascular hypertrophy, increases vascular permeability and vascular inflammation (p65, caspase 1, VCAM, ICAM and MCP1), increases inflammatory cell infiltration in the kidney, reduces telomerase expression, and accelerates vascular senescence and age-dependent hypertension; conversely, increased Sirt3 expression in Sirt3OX mice prevents these deleterious effects. The clinical relevance of Sirt3 depletion was confirmed in arterioles from human mediastinal fat in patients with essential hypertension showing a 40% decrease in vascular Sirt3, coupled with Sirt3 dependent 3-fold increases in SOD2 acetylation, NfKB activity, VCAM, ICAM and MCP1 levels in hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive subjects. <b>Conclusions:</b> We suggest that Sirt3 depletion in hypertension promotes endothelial dysfunction, vascular hypertrophy, vascular inflammation and end-organ damage.

Among the factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of OA, the natural process of aging is regarded as the most significant risk factor. AGEs, which are extremely resilient to degradation, are produced in the body naturally as a result of the Maillard process of nonenzymatic glycation and are also introduced through diet and tobacco smoke. AGEs have a high affinity for collagen and therefore accumulate in joint tissues, where they induce increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and degradative enzymes. Additionally, AGEs induce oxidative stress, which further exacerbates the degradative process. Type II collagen is targeted for degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-3 and MMP-13, and AGEs have been shown to trigger increased expression of these MMPs. The role of retinoid and rexinoid receptors as specific treatment targets has been receiving increasing attention. Bexarotene is a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist used for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma and other cancers which has displayed a favourable safety profile. Here, we examined the roles of RXR agonism using bexarotene on AGE-induced markers of OA, including oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and MMP-mediated degradation of type II collagen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bexarotene inhibited phosphorylation of IκBα, thereby suppressing activation of the proinflammatory NF-κB cellular signalling pathway. These findings present a basis for selective targeting of RXR by bexarotene as a potential treatment of OA induced by AGEs.</AbstractText>"}

Prolonged quiescence comes with a cost, reducing the subsequent speed and potential to return to proliferation. Here, we show that a similar process happens during Caenorhabditis elegans development, providing an in vivo model to study proliferative capacity after quiescence. Hatching under starvation provokes the arrest of blast cell divisions that normally take place during the first larval stage (L1). We have used a novel method to precisely quantify each stage of postembryonic development to analyze the consequences of prolonged L1 quiescence. We report that prolonged L1 quiescence delays the reactivation of blast cell divisions in C. elegans, leading to a delay in the initiation of postembryonic development. The transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO is necessary for rapid recovery after extended arrest, and this effect is independent from its role as a suppressor of cell proliferation. Instead, the activation of DAF-16 by decreased insulin signaling reduces the rate of L1 aging, increasing proliferative potential. We also show that yolk provisioning affects the proliferative potential after L1 arrest modulating the rate of L1 aging, providing a possible mechanistic link between insulin signaling and the maintenance of proliferative potential. Furthermore, variable yolk provisioning in embryos is one of the sources of interindividual variability in recovery after quiescence of genetically identical animals. Our results support the relevance of L1 arrest as an in vivo model to study stem cell-like aging and the mechanisms for maintenance of proliferation potential after quiescence.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Metformin increases resistance to not only the Gram-negative pathogens <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> but also the Gram-positive pathogens <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Meanwhile, metformin protects the animals from the infection by enhancing the tolerance to the pathogen infection rather than by reducing the bacterial burden. Through the screening of classical immune pathways in <i>C. elegans</i>, we find metformin enhances innate immunity through p38 MAPK pathway. Furthermore, activated p38/PMK-1 by metformin acts on the intestine for innate immune response. In addition, metformin-treated mice have increased resistance to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PA14 infection and significantly increased the levels of active PMK-1. Therefore, promoted p38/PMK-1-mediated innate immunity by metformin is conserved from worms to mammals.

We conducted a study to (1) determine current beliefs about obtaining patients' informed consent for tPA among a large group of stroke clinicians and (2) identify the ethical, clinical, and organizational factors that influence tPA consent practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by trained and experienced investigators and research staff to identify key barriers to implementing acute stroke services. Part of the interview explored current beliefs and practices around informed consent for tPA. This was a multicenter study that included 38 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospital locations. Participants were 68 stroke team clinicians, serving primarily on the neurology (35 percent) or emergency medicine (41 percent) service. We conducted thematic analysis based on principles of grounded theory to identify codes about consent for tPA. We used interpretive convergence to ensure consistency among the individual investigators' codes and to ensure that all of the investigators agreed on coding and themes. We found that 38 percent of the stroke clinicians did not believe any form of consent was necessary for tPA, 47 percent thought that some form of consent was necessary, and 15 percent were unsure. Clinicians who believed tPA required informed consent were divided on whether consent should be written (40 percent) or verbal (60 percent). We identified three factors describing clinicians' attitudes about consent: (1) legal and policy factors, (2) ethical factors, and (3) medical factors. The lack of consensus regarding consent for tPA creates the potential for delays in treatment, uneasiness among clinicians, and legal liability. The identified factors provide a potential framework to guide discussions about developing a standard of care for acquiring the informed consent of patients for the administration of tPA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2019 The Journal of Clinical Ethics.

Since strong consensus regarding commonly altered MRs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is lacking, we generated a compendium of HCC datasets from 21 studies and identified a comprehensive signature consisting of 483 genes commonly deregulated in HCC. We then used reverse engineering of transcriptional networks to identify the MRs that underpin the development and progression of HCC. After cross-validation in different HCC datasets, systematic assessment using patient-derived data confirmed prognostic predictive capacities for most HCC MRs and their corresponding regulons. Our HCC signature covered well-established liver cancer hallmarks, and network analyses revealed coordinated interaction between several MRs. One novel MR, <i>SEC14L2</i>, exerted an anti-proliferative effect in HCC cells and strongly suppressed tumor growth in a mouse model. This study advances our knowledge of transcriptional MRs potentially involved in HCC development and progression that may be targeted by specific interventions.</AbstractText>"}

Indeed, the physiological process of ageing causes a variety of molecular and cellular phenotypes. With dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction implicated as a key pathological mechanism in ALS, and each lower motor unit cell type vulnerable to its own set of age-related phenotypes, the effects of ageing might in fact prove a prerequisite to ALS, rendering the cells susceptible to disease-specific mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss evidence for overlap between age and ALS-associated hallmarks, potentially implicating cell type-specific ageing as a key contributor to this multifactorial and complex disease. With a dearth of disease-modifying therapy currently available for ALS patients and a substantial failure in bench to bedside translation of other potential therapies, the unification of research in ageing and ALS requires high fidelity models to better recapitulate age-related human disease and will ultimately yield more reliable candidate therapeutics for patients, with the aim of enhancing healthspan and life expectancy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

The improved longevity of adults with operated congenital heart disease who develop heart failure as an increasingly late event makes this form of liver injury increasingly clinically relevant. Patients with congenital heart disease with a single ventricle anomaly, who require creation of a Fontan circulation, are particularly vulnerable as they have elevated venous filling pressures with chronic liver congestion. Progression to liver fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis may occur, with its associated risks of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. This risk likely increases over the patient's lifetime, related to the duration post-surgical repair and reflects the chronicity of congestion. Liver biopsy is rarely performed due to a higher risk of complications in the setting of elevated venous pressures, and the frequent use of anticoagulation. Non-invasive methods of liver assessment are poorly validated and different factors require consideration compared to other chronic liver diseases. This review discusses the current understanding of cardiac hepatopathy in congenital heart disease patients with a Fontan circulation. This entity has recently been called Fontan Associated Liver Disease in the literature, with the term useful in recognising that the pathophysiology is incompletely understood, and that long-standing venous pressure elevation and hypoxaemia are presumed to play an additional significant role in the pathogenesis of the liver injury.</AbstractText>"}

Brain aging is related to a decrease in the vascularity, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Cerebrolysin, a peptide and amino acid preparation, has been shown to improve the cognitive performance in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 4 protein exhibits a strong synaptogenic activity in the hippocampal synapses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the cerebrolysin treatment on the learning and memory abilities, sensorimotor functions, and the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 4 protein expression in the brain of 15-month-old rats. Cerebrolysin (1076 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered to Wistar rats intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. After the treatments, learning and memory were tested using the Barnes maze test, and the acoustic startle response, and its pre-pulse inhibition and habituation were measured. Finally, the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 4 expression was measured in the brainstem, striatum, and hippocampus using a Western-blot assay. The 15-month-old vehicle-treated rats showed impairments in the habituation of the acoustic startle response and in learning and memory when compared to 3-month-old rats. These impairments were attenuated by the subchronic cerebrolysin treatment. The leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 4 protein expression was lower in the old vehicle-treated rats than in the young rats; the cerebrolysin treatment attenuated that decrease in the old rats. The leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 4 protein was not expressed in striatum or brainstem. These results suggest that the subchronic cerebrolysin treatment enhances the learning and memory abilities in aging by increasing the expression of the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 4 protein in the hippocampus.</AbstractText>"}

The GSE profiles shared 379 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 249 upregulated genes, and 130 downregulated genes. A protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed and analyzed using STRING and Cytoscape. Functional and signaling pathways of the shared DEGs with significant p values were identified. Kaplan-Meier plots of integrated expression scores were used to analyze survival outcomes. These suggested that <i>FN1</i>, <i>ICAM1</i>, <i>CXCR4</i>, <i>TYROBP</i>, <i>EGF</i>, <i>CAV1</i>, <i>CCND1</i> and <i>PECAM1/CD31</i> were independent prognostic factors in ccRCC. Finally, to investigate early events in renal cancer, we screened for the hub genes <i>CCND1</i> and <i>PECAM1/CD31</i>. In summary, integrated bioinformatics analysis identified candidate DEGs and pathways in ccRCC that could improve our understanding of the causes and underlying molecular events of ccRCC. These candidate genes and pathways could be therapeutic targets for ccRCC.</AbstractText>"}

The current research advances the understanding of these findings by incorporating a cultural perspective. We tested whether the relationship between age and well-being is moderated by <i>uncertainty avoidance</i>, a cultural dimension dealing with society's tolerance for ambiguity. In Study 1 (<i>N</i> = 64,228), using a multilevel approach with an international database, we found that older age was associated with lower well-being in countries higher in uncertainty avoidance but not in countries lower in uncertainty avoidance. Further, this cultural variation was mediated by a sense of control. In Study 2 (<i>N</i> = 1,025), we compared a culture with low uncertainty avoidance (the United States) with a culture with high uncertainty avoidance (Romania) and found a consistent pattern: Age was negatively associated with well-being in Romania but not in the United States. This cultural difference was mediated by the use of contrasting coping strategies associated with different levels of a sense of control.</AbstractText>"}

In this review, we focus on donor macrophages as a new target to achieve allograft tolerance. Donor organ-directed therapies have the potential to improve allograft survival while minimizing patient harm related to global suppression of recipient immune responses.

Recent advances in neutrophil biology have contributed to a better understanding of periodontal disease pathogenesis and, reciprocally, the study of periodontitis has led to important insights into neutrophil regulation and function. Here, the contributions by our group to this field through interdisciplinary collaboration are discussed. The study of leukocyte adhesion deficiency-associated periodontitis has revealed that the connection of neutrophils with destructive inflammation may involve mechanisms beyond the typical bystander injury dogma. In this regard, neutrophils are required for important immunomodulatory functions and their absence from the periodontium leads to dysregulated overproduction of interleukin-17, which drives inflammatory bone loss. We have also discovered that both the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow and their recruitment to peripheral tissues, including the periodontium, are homeostatically regulated by a secreted protein designated developmental endothelial locus-1. However, developmental endothelial locus-1 expression, and hence developmental endothelial locus-1-dependent homeostasis, declines considerably with aging and contributes to an increased susceptibility to periodontitis in old age. Moreover, our work has mechanistically supported the concept that periodontitis is a dysbiotic disease and we have shown that neutrophils become targets of immune subversion by periodontal bacteria in a manner that promotes dysbiosis. The mechanism involves microbial exploitation of key neutrophil receptors (complement C5a receptor-1 and toll-like receptor-2), leading to crosstalk signaling that uncouples neutrophil-mediated killing (which is impaired) from neutrophil-induced inflammation (which is enhanced). These studies have collectively established new mechanisms governing the protective and destructive functions of neutrophils in periodontitis and offered targeted host-modulation approaches for the treatment of periodontal diseases.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

Utilizing novel nutritional strategies to attenuate such losses is of great importance in elderly individuals. We aimed to test if a complete dietary supplement containing 25 g of milk proteins and ingested in the evening before bed would improve protein metabolism in terms of whole body protein balance over a 10 h overnight period following ingestion of the test drink in healthy middle-aged male subjects. In addition we also assessed the rates of muscle protein synthesis during the second half of the night in order to see if previously reported extended amino acidemia during sleep results in increased rates of muscle protein synthesis. Seventeen healthy middle-aged male subjects (59.4 ± 3.2 year) consumed a dietary supplement drink at 21:00 containing either 25 g milk protein concentrate, 25 g maltodextrin, 7.75 g canola oil (treatment group), or an isocaloric protein void drink (placebo group).

This process is essential for the maintenance of cellular energy levels, components, and metabolites, as well as the elimination of cellular molecular damage, thereby playing an important role in numerous cellular activities. An important function of autophagy is to enable survival under starvation conditions and other stresses. The majority of factors implicated in aging are modifiable through the process of autophagy, including the accumulation of oxidative damage and loss of proteostasis, genomic instability and epigenetic alteration. These primary causes of damage could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulation of nutrient sensing pathways and cellular senescence, finally causing a variety of aging phenotypes. Remarkably, advances in the biology of aging have revealed that aging is a malleable process: a mild decrease in signaling through nutrient-sensing pathways can improve health and extend lifespan in all model organisms tested. Consequently, autophagy is implicated in both aging and age-related disease. Enhancement of the autophagy process is a common characteristic of all principal, evolutionary conserved anti-aging interventions, including dietary restriction, as well as inhibition of target of rapamycin (TOR) and insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS). As an emerging and critical process in aging, this review will highlight how autophagy can be modulated for health improvement.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Stead, Castillo-Quan, Martinez Miguel, Lujan, Ketteler, Kinghorn and Bjedov.</CopyrightInformation>"}

For example, rodents fed a methionine-restricted diet are up to 45% longer-lived than control-fed animals. Tantalizingly, ongoing studies suggest that humans could enjoy similar benefits from this intervention. While the benefits of MR are likely due, at least in part, to improved cellular stress tolerance, it remains to be determined exactly how MR extends organismal healthspan. In previous work, we made use of the yeast chronological lifespan (CLS) assay to model the extension of cellular lifespan conferred by MR and explore the genetic requirements for this extension. In these studies, we demonstrated that both dietary MR (D-MR) and genetic MR (G-MR) (i.e., impairment of the cell's methionine biosynthetic machinery) significantly extend the CLS of yeast. This extension was found to require the mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde (RTG) stress signaling pathway, and was associated with a multitude of gene expression changes, a significant proportion of which was also dependent on RTG signaling. Here, we show work aimed at understanding how a subset of the observed expression changes are causally related to MR-dependent CLS extension. Specifically, we find that multiple autophagy-related genes are upregulated by MR, likely resulting in an increased autophagic capacity. Consistent with activated autophagy being important for the benefits of MR, we also find that loss of any of several core autophagy factors abrogates the extended CLS observed for methionine-restricted cells. In addition, epistasis analyses provide further evidence that autophagy activation underlies the benefits of MR to yeast. Strikingly, of the many types of selective autophagy known, our data clearly demonstrate that MR-mediated CLS extension requires only the autophagic recycling of mitochondria (i.e., mitophagy). Indeed, we find that functional mitochondria are required for the full benefit of MR to CLS. Finally, we observe substantial alterations in carbon metabolism for cells undergoing MR, and provide evidence that such changes are directly responsible for the extended lifespan of methionine-restricted yeast. In total, our data indicate that MR produces changes in carbon metabolism that, together with the oxidative metabolism of mitochondria, result in extended cellular lifespan.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Plummer and Johnson.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This return of the secular stagnation hypothesis occurred in November 2013, when Lawrence Summers postulated that the global economy was facing a scenario of low growth, low inflation, and a reduction in GDP per capita due to a chronic insufficiency of aggregate demand. The causes should be sought not only in cyclical factors associated with a long financial cycle and excessive accumulated public and private debt, but also in structural changes in the central economies in recent decades, linked to the rapid slowdown in population growth and the gradual aging of the population. Finally, other factors also depress demand, such as the progressive exhaustion of the globalization process and the consolidation of new labor models. In light of these developments, this paper's aim is twofold: first, to perform an econometric panel-data study in order to determine the influence of each of these factors in explaining secular stagnation in recent years for the selected sample of countries; and, second, to lay out proposals for reorienting the government intervention strategies adopted since the onset of the financial crisis to promote consumption and achieve sustained growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Callejas-Albiñana, Martín de Vidales Carrasco, Martínez-Rodríguez and Callejas-Albiñana.</CopyrightInformation>"}

EMOTICOM is the first comprehensive neuropsychological test battery developed specifically to assess hot cognition. The aim of the study was to validate and establish a Danish language version and reference data for the EMOTICOM test battery. To evaluate the psychometric properties of 11 EMOTICOM tasks, we collected data from 100 healthy Danish participants (50 males, 50 females) including retest data from 49 participants. We assessed test-retest reliability, floor and ceiling effects, task-intercorrelations, and correlations between task performance and relevant demographic and descriptive factors. We found that test-retest reliability varied from poor to excellent while some tasks exhibited floor or ceiling effects. Intercorrelations among EMOTICOM task outcomes were low, indicating that the tasks capture different cognitive constructs. EMOTICOM task performance was largely independent of age, sex, education, and IQ as well as current mood, personality, and self-reported motivation and diligence during task completion. Overall, many of the EMOTICOM tasks were found to be useful and objective measures of hot cognition although select tasks may benefit from modifications to avoid floor and ceiling effects in healthy individuals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Dam, Thystrup, Jensen, Bland, Mortensen, Elliott, Sahakian, Knudsen, Frokjaer and Stenbæk.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Preliminary evidence indicates that older athletes have a tendency to compare themselves (in terms of their performance, participation, and aging) to inactive older adults deemed 'worse-off.' Our aim was to examine the stories and experiences of older, male Masters athletes, not only in terms of their own lives and in relation to others but also in the broader context of current (neoliberal) policies that promote sport across the lifespan. We use social comparison theory to interpret our findings and highlight the strengths and limitations of social comparison as a psychological strategy. For this study, 17 male competitive athletes (age range from 70 to 90 years) who participated in either the 2013 or 2017 World Masters Games were interviewed as part of a larger project on the meaning of sport in their lives. Seven different sports were represented, and participants hailed from multiple countries. Within the interpretive paradigm, we used qualitative methods to interview each participant, analyze individual transcripts, and develop common themes across the data set to address the aforementioned aims. Our two major themes were, <i>Sport as social comparison:</i><i>'It's the competitive nature'</i> and <i>Downward comparisons</i>. A number of participants commented on the nature of sport, and competitive sport in particular, as being important to their motivation to train and prepare. Within the theme of <i>Downward comparisons</i>, we established two categories: <i>Resisting loss</i> and <i>Assigning blame</i>. While downward comparisons were used by our participants to separate themselves from other seniors of the same age, thereby bolstering their sense of self, participants also tied those comparisons to neoliberal notions of individual and moral responsibility for health. Participants believed that compromised health was due to individual negligence and bad decisions, with little reference to uncontrollable factors, such as non-modifiable risk factors for disease, disability, and/or socioeconomic status, which could be affecting people's lives or decisions. Ultimately, our findings show that the useful psychological strategy of social comparison for maintaining a positive sense of self and performance may also have some negative individual and societal consequences.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Horton, Dionigi, Gard, Baker, Weir and Deneau.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Benzenoid compounds from <i>Antrodia cinnamomea</i> are known to exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. This study sought to investigate the potential of benzenoids for treating bacteria-infected AD. The compounds were screened against methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA). Coenzyme Q<sub>0</sub> (CoQ<sub>0</sub>), a key ingredient in <i>A. cinnamomea</i>, showed the strongest MRSA growth inhibition. We further tested the inhibitory effect of CoQ<sub>0</sub> on planktonic and biofilm MRSA. The work was also performed to explore the potential effectiveness of CoQ<sub>0</sub> on AD using activated keratinocytes and <i>in vivo</i> experimental AD mice as the models. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of CoQ<sub>0</sub> against MRSA were 7.81 μg/ml. CoQ<sub>0</sub> was found to eradicate biofilm MRSA efficiently and reduce the biofilm thickness. CoQ<sub>0</sub> killed MRSA by inhibiting DNA polymerase and topoisomerases. A proteomic assay showed that CoQ<sub>0</sub> also reduced the ribosomal proteins. In the anti-inflammation study, CoQ<sub>0</sub> was found to downregulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)5, and CCL17 in HaCaT cells. CoQ<sub>0</sub> at 0.5 μg/ml could recover the filaggrin decreased by HaCaT activation to the normal control. We established a bacteria-infected AD-like model in mice using ovalbumin (OVA) and topically applied MRSA. Topical CoQ<sub>0</sub> delivery lessened the MRSA presence in the AD-like lesions by &gt;90%. The erythema, barrier function, and epidermal thickness of the AD-like wounds were improved by CoQ<sub>0</sub> through the reduction of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, and by neutrophil infiltration in the lesional skin. CoQ<sub>0</sub> is therefore regarded as effective in mitigating AD symptoms associated with bacterial load.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Chou, Lee, Huang, Wang, Chen, Chen, Chang, Fang and Yang.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Recently, it has showed its protective effect in colitis mice by activating the SIRT1/FoxOs pathway. Whereas, it is not known whether Sal has other protective mechanisms on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of Sal on DSS-induced colitis in mice. The results demonstrated Sal was a competent candidate in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Sal remitted DSS-induced disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening, and colonic pathological damage. Simultaneously, Sal alleviated excessive inflammation by reversing the IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 protein levels in DSS-treated mice. Western blot analysis revealed that Sal inhibited p65 and p38 activation together with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) up-regulation. In addition, Sal skewed the imbalanced activation of nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome and autophagy contributing to colitis recovery. The damaged intestinal barrier induced by DSS was also alleviated along with plasma lipopolysaccharides (LPS) reduction after Sal treatment. <i>In vitro</i>, Sal showed PPARγ-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In summary, our results demonstrated that Sal might be an effective factor for UC treatment and its pharmacological value deserved further development.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Liu, Cai, Fan, Zhang and Cao.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We hypothesized that restoring the balance within the neurovascular unit may lead to an improved neurorestoration after focal ischemia. Recently, an innovative technology has been invented to efficiently convert proliferating astroglial cells into neurons in the injured young brain. However, the conversion efficacy of this technology has not been explored in the post-stroke brains of the aged rodents. To this end, we used a retroviral delivery system encoding the transcription factor <i>Ngn2</i> alone or in combination with the antiapoptotic factor <i>Bcl-2</i> to target proliferating astrocytes in the neocortex of young and aged mice after cerebral ischemia. Successful direct <i>in vivo</i> reprogramming of reactive glia into neuroblasts and mature neurons was assessed by cellular phenotyping. We found that the conversion efficacy of proliferating astrocytes into neurons after cerebral ischemia in young and aged mice is disappointingly low, most likely because the therapeutic vectors carrying the conversion gene are engulfed by phagocytes shortly after intracortical administration. We conclude that other viral vectors and combinations of transcription factors should be employed to improve the efficacy of glia-to-neuron conversion after stroke in young and aged rodents.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gresita, Glavan, Udristoiu, Catalin, Hermann and Popa-Wagner.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Anti-inflammatory agents could reduce the risk or slow the progression of PD. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside extracted from the roots of <i>Rehmannia</i> radix, has been reported to reduce the release of inflammatory factors and exert neuroprotective effects. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice were used as the PD model and the roles of catalpol on DA neurons and its potential mechanism were investigated in this study. We found that catalpol administration mitigated the loss of DA neurons induced by MPTP and increased exploratory behavior along with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, which was accompanied by astrocyte and microglia activation. Importantly, catalpol administration significantly inhibited MPTP-triggered oxidative stress, restored growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Further, we found that catalpol suppressed the activation of MKK4/JNK/c-Jun signaling, and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors and inflammasome in the mouse model of PD. Our results suggest that catalpol relieves MPTP-triggered oxidative stress, which may benefit to avoid the occurrence of chronic inflammatory reaction. Catalpol alleviates MPTP-triggered oxidative stress and thereby prevents neurodegenerative diseases-related inflammatory reaction, highlighting its therapeutic potential for the management of PD symptoms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Wang, Yu, Li, Zhao, Wang, Wang and He.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Further subcategorization to MCI subtype has led to more distinct prognoses and it is widely considered that amnestic and non-amnestic MCI (aMCI, naMCI) likely have distinct pathophysiologies. Yet, accurately classification remains contentious. Here, we differentiate hippocampal subfield volume between subtypes, diagnosed according to stringent clinical consensus criteria, where aMCI is characterized based on deficits in delayed recall (rather than encoding). We then identify memory performance correlates to subfield volume and associations with long-term cognitive performance and outcome. 3D T1-weighted structural MRI was acquired in 142 participants recruited from the <i>Healthy Brain Aging (HBA) Clinic</i> and diagnosed with aMCI (<i>n</i> = 38), naMCI (<i>n</i> = 84) or subjective memory complaints (SMC; <i>n</i> = 20). T1-weighted datasets were processed with the cortical and hippocampal subfield processing streams in FreeSurfer (v6.0). Subfield volumes, and associations with baseline and longitudinal objective memory scores were then examined. Subfield volumes were found to differentiate clinical profiles: subiculum, CA1, CA4 and dentate gyrus volumes were significantly reduced in aMCI compared to both naMCI and SMC. CA1 subfield volume was shown to predict concurrent memory performance in aMCI, while dentate gyrus volume significantly predicted longitudinal verbal learning and memory decline in the entire cohort. Our findings demonstrate that using a more stringent diagnostic approach to characterizing aMCI is well justified, as delayed recall deficits are strongly linked to underlying volumetric subfield reductions in CA1, CA4 and the dentate gyrus, subfields known to be associated with mnemonic processes. Further research is now warranted to replicate these findings in other MCI samples.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Broadhouse, Mowszowski, Duffy, Leung, Cross, Valenzuela and Naismith.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Previously, we described that pharmacological inhibition of c-Abl prevents AβOs-induced synaptic alterations. Hence, this kinase seems to be a key element in AD progression. Here, we studied the role of c-Abl on dendritic spine morphological changes induced by AβOs using c-Abl null neurons (c-Abl-KO). First, we characterized the effect of c-Abl deficiency on dendritic spine density and found that its absence increases dendritic spine density. While AβOs-treatment reduces the spine number in both wild-type (WT) and c-Abl-KO neurons, AβOs-driven spine density loss was not affected by c-Abl. We then characterized AβOs-induced morphological changes in dendritic spines of c-Abl-KO neurons. AβOs induced a decrease in the number of mushroom spines in c-Abl-KO neurons while preserving the populations of immature stubby, thin, and filopodia spines. Furthermore, synaptic contacts evaluated by PSD95/Piccolo clustering and cell viability were preserved in AβOs-exposed c-Abl-KO neurons. In conclusion, our results indicate that in the presence of AβOs c-Abl participates in synaptic contact removal, increasing susceptibility to AβOs damage. Its deficiency increases the immature spine population reducing AβOs-induced synapse elimination. Therefore, c-Abl signaling could be a relevant actor in the early stages of AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gutierrez, Vargas, Chandia-Cristi, de la Fuente, Leal and Alvarez.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Extensive research evidence indicates that T2D is a well-established risk factor for AD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, how T2D may contribute to the progression of AD is a subject of extensive investigation. In this study, we compared the blood transcriptome of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and advanced AD to those afflicted with T2D to unveil shared and unique pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Blood transcriptomic analyses revealed a positive correlation between gene expression profiles of MCI, AD, and T2D in seven independent microarrays. Interestingly, gene expression profiles from women with advanced AD correlated negatively with T2D, suggesting sex-specific differences in T2D as a risk factor for AD. Network and pathway analysis revealed that shared molecular networks between MCI and T2D were predominantly enriched in inflammation and infectious diseases whereas those networks shared between overt AD and T2D were involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway, a major mediator of insulin signaling in the body. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway became more significantly dysregulated in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Furthermore, endocrine resistance and atherosclerosis pathways emerged as dysregulated pathways in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Interestingly, network analysis of shared differentially expressed genes between children with T2D and MCI subjects identified forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a central transcriptional regulator, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in AD. Collectively, these results suggest that T2D may be implicated at different stages of AD through different molecular pathways disrupted during the preclinical phase of AD and more advanced stages of the disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Santiago, Bottero and Potashkin.</CopyrightInformation>"}

These findings raise the possibility that brain-derived EV's present in blood can be used to monitor disease processes occurring in the cerebrum. Since the levels of certain micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, we sought to assess miRNA dysregulation in AD brain tissue and to determine if these changes were reflected in neural EVs isolated from blood of subjects with AD. To this end, we employed high-content miRNA arrays to search for differences in miRNAs in RNA pools from brain tissue of AD (<i>n</i> = 5), high pathological control (HPC) (<i>n</i> = 5), or cognitively intact pathology-free controls (<i>n</i> = 5). Twelve miRNAs were altered by &gt;1.5-fold in AD compared to controls, and six of these were also changed compared to HPCs. Analysis of hits in brain extracts from 11 AD, 7 HPCs and 9 controls revealed a similar fold difference in these six miRNAs, with three showing statistically significant group differences and one with a strong trend toward group differences. Thereafter, we focused on the four miRNAs that showed group differences and measured their content in neurally derived blood EVs isolated from 63 subjects: 16 patients with early stage dementia and a CSF Aβ42+ tau profile consistent with AD, 16 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and an AD CSF profile, and 31 cognitively intact controls with normal CSF Aβ42+ tau levels. ROC analysis indicated that measurement of miR-132-3p in neurally-derived plasma EVs showed good sensitivity and specificity to diagnose AD, but did not effectively separate individuals with AD-MCI from controls. Moreover, when we measured the levels of a related miRNA, miR-212, we found that this miRNA was also decreased in neural EVs from AD patients compared to controls.

A choir-singing group and an age- and audiometrically-matched do-nothing control group underwent pre- and post-testing over a 10-week period. Linear mixed effects modeling in a regression analysis showed that choir participants demonstrated improvements in speech-in-noise perception, pitch discrimination ability, and the strength of the neural representation of speech fundamental frequency. Choir participants' gains in SIN perception were mediated by improvements in pitch discrimination, which was in turn predicted by the strength of the neural representation of speech stimuli (FFR), suggesting improvements in pitch processing as a possible mechanism for this SIN perceptual improvement.

The issue of increased BPV is of particular clinical importance due to high predictive value of this parameter as a risk factor for fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal events. It is proved that in the BPV increasing, the key role is played by impairments in arterial baroreflexes, which, in turn, are mediated by increased vascular stiffness, impact of angiotensin II and the sympathetic nervous system, endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide deficiency and aging, including the vascular aging. Antihypertensive drugs that targeting largest amount of pathophysiological mechanisms in BPV increasing have a most advantages in correcting excessive pressure fluctuations.

The study included 104 men (aged from 65 to 90 years), further stratified into blue- and white-collar groups (66 and 38 subjects, respectively). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess their physical activity levels. Physical performance was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB) and handgrip strength (HGS) measurement. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to identify the risk for depression. Mean physical activity in the study population was moderate in almost 70%, high in 19% and low in 11% of the subjects. Men with high physical activity levels had better SPPB and GDS scores (<i>p</i> = .01 and <i>p</i> = .001, respectively).

FAPbI 3 has two polymorphs (black α-FAPbI 3 and yellow δ-FAPbI 3 ) in ambient temperature. The yellow δ-FAPbI 3 which has no photoactivity with a chain-like structure is likely to hinder electron transport and reduce the photovoltaic performance. However, pure-phase black α-FAPbI 3 without yellow phase is difficult to obtain and the underlying mechanism of phase transition is rarely investigated. Here, we propose a facile bi-additive method (BA method) to eliminate the yellow δ-FAPbI 3 completely by induction of phase transition from δ-FAPbI 3 to α-FAPbI 3 . HI and Pb(SCN) 2 were employed as bi-additives. Based on the investigation of annealing time and temperature, we suppose that the BA method can induce the phase transition and enhance the α-FAPbI 3 stability. Due to the enhanced crystallization as well as uniform morphology, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) made from BA method exhibit an increased power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, the optimal devices display excellent stability, which can maintain over 80% of initial PCE after 400-hour aging in the air.

Examining sleep and stressors jointly may account for greater variability in health outcomes; however, we know little about the combined effect of both insufficient sleep and more stressors on metabolic health.

One-hundred and twenty-seven participants (M<sub>age</sub>  = 45.24 ± 6.22 years) reported nightly sleep characteristics and daily stressors on 8 consecutive days. We collected height and weight measurements to calculate body mass index (kg m-<sup>2</sup> ). On average, workers reported more stressors following nights with shorter-than-usual sleep duration or poorer-than-usual sleep quality (negative slope means higher stressor reactivity to insufficient sleep). When examining stressor reactivity to insufficient sleep with insufficient sleep represented by shorter-than-usual sleep duration, compared with those with average stressor reactivity to insufficient sleep (within ±½ SD; reference), workers with high stressor reactivity to insufficient sleep (≤-½ SD) had higher body mass index (B = 3.24, p &lt; .05).

Here, we investigated the specificity of carvacrol for TRPM7 in Schwann cells and the regulatory effect of carvacrol on TRPM7-dependent neurodegenerative processes. To construct peripheral nerve degeneration model, we used with a sciatic explant culture and sciatic nerve axotomy. Ex vivo, in vivo sciatic nerves were treated with carvacrol following an assessment of demyelination (ovoid fragmentation) and axonal degradation using morphometric indices. In these models, carvacrol effectively suppressed the morphometric indices, such as stripe, ovoid, myelin, and neurofilament indices during peripheral nerve degeneration. We found that carvacrol significantly inhibited upregulation of TRPM7 in Schwann cells. In this study, our results suggest that carvacrol effectively protects against the peripheral neurodegenerative process via TRPM7-dependent regulation in Schwann cells.

Although osteosarcopenia is a result of age-related deterioration in muscle and bone, there are many risk factors that provoking osteosarcopenia. These risk factors should be considered by the clinicians to treat osteosarcopenia. We assessed the link between osteosarcopenia and conventional risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. This study was a cross-sectional study that has been conducted within the framework of Bushehr Elderly Health (BEH) program stage II in which participants aged ≥ 60 years were included. Osteopenia/osteoporosis was defined as a t-score ≤  - 1.0 standard deviation below the mean values of a young healthy adult. We defined sarcopenia as reduced skeletal muscle mass plus low muscle strength and/or low physical performance. Osteosarcopenia was considered as the presence of both osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia. We estimated the age-standardized prevalence of osteosarcopenia for men and women, separately. Using modified Poisson regression analysis, adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% CI was used to show the measure of associations in the final model. Among 2353 participants, 1205 (51.2%) were women. Age-standardized prevalence of osteosarcopenia was 33.8 (95% CI 31.0-36.5) in men and 33.9 (30.9-36.8) in women. In both sexes, the inverse association was detected with body mass index and having osteosarcopenia (PR 0.84, 95% CI 0.81-0.88 in men and 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.80 in women). In both sexes, high-fat mass was positively associated with osteosarcopenia [PR 1.46 (95% CI 1.11-1.92) in men, and 2.25 (95% CI 1.71-2.95) in women]. Physical activity had a significant inverse association in men (PR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.46, 0.88), but not in women. Diabetes was also showed a direct association with osteosarcopenia in men (PR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.69). No associations were detected between the lipid profiles and osteosarcopenia. Results demonstrated a high prevalence of osteosarcopenia in both sexes suggesting a high disease burden in a rapidly aging country. Lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, as well as chronic diseases, were significantly associated with osteosarcopenia.</AbstractText>"}

Soy protein has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, and its isoflavones may improve bone health. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of soy protein on lipid profiles and biomarkers of bone metabolism and inflammation. Ninety men and women (aged 27-87) were randomly assigned to consume 40 g of soy or casein protein daily for three months. Both soy and casein consumption significantly reduced bone alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.011) and body fat % (P &lt; 0.001), tended to decrease tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (P = 0.066), and significantly increased serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) (P &lt; 0.001), yet soy increased IGF-1 to a greater extent (P = 0.01) than casein. Neither treatment affected total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or C-reactive protein. These results demonstrate that daily supplementation of soy and casein protein may have positive effects on indices of bone metabolism and body composition, with soy protein being more effective at increasing IGF-1, an anabolic factor, which may be due to soy isoflavones' role in upregulating Runx2 gene expression, while having little effect on lipid profiles and markers of inflammation.</AbstractText>"}

One of the known perceptual decision-making processes which is vastly studied is binocular rivalry. It is well-established that the older the person, the slower the perceptual dynamics. However, the underlying neurobiological cause is unknown. So, to understand how age affects visual decision-making, we investigated age-related changes in perception during binocular rivalry. In binocular rivalry, the image presented to one eye competes for perceptual dominance with the image presented to the other eye. Perception during binocular rivalry consists of alternations between exclusive percepts. However, frequently, mixed percepts with combinations of the two monocular images occur. The mixed percepts reflect a transition from the percept of one eye to the other but frequently the transitions do not complete the full cycle and the previous exclusive percept becomes dominant again. The transitional idiosyncrasy of mixed percepts has not been studied systematically in different age groups. Previously, we have found evidence for adaptation and noise, and not inhibition, as underlying neural factors that are related to age-dependent perceptual decisions. Based on those conclusions, we predict that mixed percepts/inhibitory interactions should not change with aging. Therefore, in an old and a young age group, we studied binocular rivalry dynamics considering both exclusive and mixed percepts by using two paradigms: percept-choice and percept-switch. We found a decrease in perceptual alternation Probability for older adults, although the rate of mixed percepts did not differ significantly compared to younger adults. Interestingly, the mixed percepts play a very similar transitional idiosyncrasy in our different age groups. Further analyses suggest that differences in synaptic depression, gain modulation at the input level, and/or slower execution of motor commands are not the determining factors to explain these findings. We then argue that changes in perceptual decisions at an older age are the result of changes in neural adaptation and noise.</AbstractText>"}

FGF21 is a liver-derived hormone that induces responses to stress through acting on hypothalamus to activate the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal endocrine axis. However, roles that FGF21 plays in pathophysiology of CKD remains elusive. Here we show in mice that FGF21 is required to survive CKD but responsible for blood pressure dysregulation. When introduced with CKD, Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup> mice died earlier than wild-type mice. Paradoxically, these Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup> CKD mice escaped several complications observed in wild-type mice, including augmentation of blood pressure elevating response and activation of the sympathetic nervous system during physical activity and increase in serum noradrenalin and corticosterone levels. Supplementation of FGF21 by administration of an FGF21-expressing adeno-associated virus vector recapitulated these complications in wild-type mice and restored the survival period in Fgf21<sup>-/-</sup> CKD mice. In CKD patients, high serum FGF21 levels are independently associated with decreased baroreceptor sensitivity. Thus, increased FGF21 in CKD can be viewed as a survival response at the sacrifice of blood pressure homeostasis.</AbstractText>"}

We found that ERK1 expression levels were significantly lower in basal breast cancer compared with luminal breast cancer and normal breast tissues. RNA sequencing data suggested that ERK1 was associated with Hippo signaling pathway and cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further showed enrichment for YAP1 signaling pathway in breast cancer cell lines and tumors with low expression of ERK1. Silencing of ERK1 elevated YAP1 expression and TEAD activity in breast cancer cells. Additionally, ERK1 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation via regulation of YAP1. The Kaplan-Meier analysis of data in patients with breast cancer suggested that, higher expression of ERK1 was associated with better prognosis, whereas, higher expression of ERK2 predicted poorer prognosis.

Chronic kidney disease patients die prematurely when compared with general population, because of a higher occurrence of infections, cardiovascular events and cancer. These diseases are commonly observed in the elderly population and frequently associated with immune senescence. Indeed, chronic kidney disease causes a premature aging of the T lymphocyte compartment, widely related to a decrease in thymic function, a phenomenon that plays a key role in the onset of age-related diseases in chronic kidney disease patients. The degree of immune senescence also influences patients' outcome after renal transplantation, particularly the risk of acute rejection and infections. Partial reversion of pre-transplant immune senescence is observed for some renal transplant patients. In conclusion, to reduce the increasing incidence of morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease patients, a better knowledge of uremia-induced immune senescence would help to pave the way to build clinical studies and promote innovative therapeutic approaches. We believe that therapeutic reversion and immune senescence prevention approaches will be part of the management of chronic kidney disease patients in the future.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Such damage can be direct, through interactions of DNA with UV photons, or indirect, mainly through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species that introduce oxidative changes to the DNA. Oxidative stress and DNA damage also associate with profound changes at the cellular and molecular level involving several cell cycle and signal transduction factors responsible for DNA repair or irreversible changes linked to ageing. Crucially, some of these factors constitute part of the signalling known for the induction of biological changes in non-irradiated, neighbouring cells and defined as the bystander effect. Network interactions with a number of natural compounds, based on their known activity towards these biomarkers in the skin, reveal the capacity to inhibit both the bystander signalling and cell cycle/DNA damage molecules while increasing expression of the anti-oxidant enzymes. Based on this information, we discuss the likely polypharmacology applications of the natural compounds and next-generation screening technologies in improving the anti-oxidant and DNA repair capacities of the skin.</AbstractText>"}

However, recent research has revealed that the so-called 'Weismann Barrier' is leaky, and that information is transferred from soma to germline. Moreover, the germline itself is now known to age, and to be influenced by an age-related deterioration of the soma that houses and protects it. This could reduce the likelihood of successful reproduction by old individuals, but also lead to long-term deleterious consequences for any offspring that they do produce (including a shortened lifespan). Here, we review the evidence from a diverse and multidisciplinary literature for senescence in the germline and its consequences; we also examine the underlying mechanisms responsible, emphasizing changes in mutation rate, telomere loss, and impaired mitochondrial function in gametes. We consider the effect on life-history evolution, particularly reproductive scheduling and mate choice.

Here, we study <i>sex-ratio</i> (SR) X-chromosome drive in the fly <i>Drosophila recens</i>, where SR causes the death of Y-bearing sperm in male carriers. SR males only sire daughters, which all carry SR, thus giving the chromosome a transmission advantage. The prevalence of the SR chromosome appears stable, suggesting pleiotropic costs. It was previously shown that females homozygous for SR are sterile, and here, we test for additional fitness costs of SR. We found that females heterozygous for SR have reduced fecundity and that male SR carriers have reduced fertility in conditions of sperm competition. We then use our fitness estimates to parametrize theoretical models of SR drive and show that the decrease in fecundity and sperm competition performance can account for the observed prevalence of SR in natural populations. In addition, we found that the expected equilibrium frequency of the SR chromosome is particularly sensitive to the degree of multiple mating and performance in sperm competition.

A G4C2 repeat expansion in <i>C9orf72</i> is the most common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9ALS-FTD). We previously identified a C9orf72-SMCR8-containing complex.

In <i>c9orf72</i> or <i>smcr8</i> mutant macrophages, lysosomal degradation and exocytosis were impaired due to the disruption of autolysosome acidification.

Inhibition of hyperactive MTORC1 partially rescued macrophage dysfunction, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in <i>c9orf72</i> or <i>smcr8</i> mutant mice. Pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal degradation upregulated MTOR protein and MTORC1 signaling in differentiated wild-type macrophages, which resemble phenotypes in KO mice.

The study is based on data from Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), in which 16,412 people from 18 countries contributed 24,583 observations. Multilevel analyses were used; the data were pooled into one dataset, in which individuals (first-level variables) were nested within countries (second-level variables). The results reveal that few employees choose to switch to self-employment between age 50 and retirement. Characteristics such as health limitations, marital status, and national unemployment rates affect these employees' decisions to become self-employed. Given the wage gaps between salaried employees and self-employed and the few employment opportunities available to salaried employees after they reach the official retirement age, the transition to self-employment is a solution for those who need sources of income or wish to remain active after retirement age.</AbstractText>"}

Diseases related to aging also come with it. There are some diseases that people can't treat fundamentally. Therefore, people try to find a natural ingredient from natural medicine to treat these diseases and improve the quality of life of the elderly. With the screening of a large number of traditional Chinese medicines, we found that polysaccharides from <i>Rehmannia glutinous</i> (PRG) can prolong the lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>). Neutral polysaccharide is the main component of PRG. In the present study, we used a <i>C. elegans</i> model to illustrate the stress resistance and lifespan extension effect and mechanism of two kinds of neutral polysaccharide fractions from <i>Rehmannia glutinosa</i> (NPRG), respectively called NPRRP and NPRR. Our data showed that two kinds of neutral polysaccharides fractions could extend the lifespan and delay senescence of wild-type worms. Moreover, the mechanism study revealed that NPRG was able to promote the nuclear localization of DAF-16 resulting in the activation of antioxidant enzymatic systems under oxidative stress. We also observed that NPRG didn't increase the lifespan of mutants with daf-16 portion loss of function, suggesting NPRG prolonging the lifespan partially required the daf-16 gene on the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway (IIS). NPRG was found to have no effect on Escherichia coli OP50 (<i>E.coli</i> OP50) growth and pharyngeal pump movement of nematodes, indicating that the anti‑aging effect of NPRG is not realized by the caloric restriction. However, mRNA levels of daf-2 were remarkably decreased after NPRG treatment. Thus daf-2 lost its inhibitory effect on the expression of daf-16 and had a continuous stimulation effect on the IIS, then prolonged the life of nematodes. Overall, our results illustrated the potential utilization of NPRG as a functional pharmaceutical ingredient to increase stress resistance and extend the life of <i>C. elegans</i> via the IIS, which could be developed as a natural supplement agent.</AbstractText>"}

Various theories have debated the mechanisms underlying resilience at the psychological level but have not yet incorporated neurocognitive concepts/findings. In this paper, we put forward the idea that cognitive flexibility moderates how well people adapt to adverse experiences, by shifting attention resources between cognition-emotion regulation and pain perception. We begin with a consensus on definitions and highlight the role of cognitive appraisals in mediating this process. Shared concepts among appraisal theories suggest that cognition-emotion, as well as pain perception, are cognitive mechanisms that underlie how people respond to adversity. Frontal brain circuitry sub-serves control of cognition and emotion, connecting the experience of physical pain. This suggests a substantial overlap between these phenomena. Empirical studies from brain imaging support this notion. We end with a discussion of how the role of the frontal brain network in regulating human resilience, including how the frontal brain network interacts with cognition-emotion-pain perception, can account for cognitive theories and why cognitive flexibilities' role in these processes can create practical applications, analogous to the resilience process, for the recovery of neural plasticity.</AbstractText>"}

A basic assumption of this paper is that out-home activities mediated through mobility can contribute to needs fulfillment, and, hence, wellbeing. This study explores the role of preferences, and individual and contextual constraints, in both the overall level of out-of-home activity participation in old age and the level of participation in three specific out-of-home activities (grocery shopping, visiting family or friends, and attending cultural activities). A person's degree of home orientation is used as an indicator of preference for indoor activities. The findings suggest that age, living status, income, education, holding a driving license, health, social network, centrality of residence, and the quality of the public transport supply have a significant impact on the overall participation level. In addition, the study suggests that the types of constraints vary between travel purposes and the location of activities. Moreover, there is an independent effect of the degree of home orientation on the overall participation level, on the degree of visits to family and friends and on the degree of attending cultural activities, which suggest that people differ in their need for out-of-home activities. However, degree of home orientation has no impact on the degree of grocery shopping, which might imply that grocery shopping is more independent of preferences. The main conclusion from this study is that the extent to which out-of-home activities fulfill needs vary between individuals, depending on their preferences as well as the interplay between individual abilities and resources and contextual conditions.</AbstractText>"}

Metabolites are cellular intermediate products of metabolic reactions, which reflect the ultimate response to genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, or environmental changes in a biological system. Aging is a complex biological process that is characterized by a gradual and progressive decline in molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organismal functions, and it is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, diet, and lifestyle factors. The precise biological mechanisms of aging remain unknown. Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize the organism phenotypes, identify altered metabolites, pathways, novel biomarkers in aging and disease, and offers wide clinical applications. Here, I will provide a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge on metabolomics led studies in aging with particular emphasis on studies leading to biomarker discovery. Based on the data obtained from model organisms and humans, it is evident that metabolites associated with amino acids, lipids, carbohydrate, and redox metabolism may serve as biomarkers of aging and/or longevity.

In this study, the protective effects of USM on UVB-induced skin aging were investigated in Hs68 cells. UVB irradiation decreased cell viability by 26% compared to the control. However, USM blocked UVB-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, USM treatment significantly decreased the UVB-induced production of reactive oxygen species and attenuated the UVB-induced production and mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by inhibiting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Furthermore, UVB exposure led to a 49.4% reduction in collagen synthesis. However, USM treatment restored collagen synthesis through upregulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/Smad2/3 pathways. These data indicate that USM regulates the production of MMPs and collagen by modulation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway and AP-1 activity, suggesting that USM may be a useful anti-photoaging ingredient.</AbstractText>"}

In addition, ARID1A has been shown to foster resistance to cancer therapy. By promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), ARID1A enhances DNA repair. Consequently, ARID1A has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Here, we report that ARID1A is regulated by human antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in a wide range of cancers and enables resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Our results indicate that HuR binds <i>ARID1A</i> mRNA, thereby increasing its stability in breast cancer cells. We further find that ARID1A expression suppresses the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by radiation and can rescue the loss of radioresistance triggered by HuR inhibition, suggesting that ARID1A plays an important role in HuR-driven resistance to radiation. Taken together, our work shows that HuR and ARID1A form an important regulatory axis in radiation resistance that can be targeted to improve radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>"}

Neurophysiological parameters, including sleep patterns, are altered in the course of aging in a similar way. Here, we investigated the effect of chronic (three months) DLAN exposure (12 L:12 Dim-light, 75:5 lux) on sleep and the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), and rest-activity behavior in young (6-month-old, n = 9) and aged (18- n = 8, 24-month-old, n = 6) C57BL/6J mice and compared with age-matched controls (n = 11, n = 9 and n = 8, respectively). We recorded the EEG and electromyogram continuously for 48-h and conducted a 6-h sleep-deprivation. A delay in the phase angle of entrainment of locomotor activity and daily vigilance state rhythms was apparent in mice following DLAN exposure, throughout the whole age spectrum, rendering sleep characteristics similar among the three age DLAN groups and significantly different from the age-matched controls. Notably, slow-wave-activity in NREM sleep (SWA, EEG power density in 0.5-4.0 Hz) was differentially altered in young and aged DLAN mice. Particularly, SWA increased as a function of age, which was further accentuated following DLAN exposure. However, this was not found in the young DLAN animals, which were characterized by the lowest SWA levels. Concluding, long-term DLAN exposure induced more pronounced alterations in the sleep architecture of young mice, towards an aging phenotype, while it enhanced age-associated sleep changes in the older groups. Our data suggest that irrespective of age, chronic DLAN exposure deteriorates sleep behavior and may consequently impact general health.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

The adverse effects of aging on sleep include sleep disruption by frequent awakenings, a decline in both non-rapid eye movement (nonREM) and REM sleep amounts, and a weaker homeostatic response to sleep loss. Evidence also suggests that sleep in females is more sensitive to changes in the ovarian steroidal milieu. The Fischer-344 rats are commonly used experimental subjects in various behavioral and physiological studies, including sleep and aging. Most sleep studies in Fischer-344 rats have used only male subjects to avoid interactions between the estrus and sleep-waking cycles. The changes in sleep-wake organization of female Fischer-344 rats especially with advancing age is not well-characterized. We determined spontaneous sleep-waking across estrus stages in young (3-4 months) cycling females. We also compared spontaneous and homeostatic sleep response profiles of young male, and female and old (24-25 months) male and female Fischer-344 rats. The results suggest that: i) sleep-wake architectures across stages of estrus cycle in young females were largely comparable except for a significant suppression of REM sleep at proestrus night and an increase in REM sleep the following day; ii) that despite hormonal differences, sleep-wake architecture in male and female rats of corresponding ages were comparable except for the suppression of REM sleep at proestrus night and higher nonREM delta power in recovery sleep; and iii) that aging significantly affected sleep-wake amounts, sleep-wake stability, and homeostatic response to sleep loss in both male and female rats and that the adverse effects of aging were largely comparable in both sexes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

PARK2 mutations cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (EO-PD). PARK2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin. Extensive in vitro studies and cell line characterization have shown that Parkin is required for mitophagy, but the physiological pathology and context of the pathway remain unknown. In general, monogenic Parkin knockout mice do not accurately reflect human PD symptoms and exhibit no signs of dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration. To assess the critical role of Parkin-mediated mitophagy in DA neurons, we characterized Parkin knockout mice over a long period of time. At the age of 110 weeks, Parkin knockout mice exhibited locomotor impairments, including hindlimb defects and neuronal loss. In their DA neurons, fragmented mitochondria with abnormal internal structures accumulated. The age-related motor dysfunction and damaged mitochondria pathology in Parkin-deficient mice suggest that impairment of mitochondrial clearance may underlie the pathology of PD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Because of its abundant consumption worldwide and the vital role of stem cells in the formation of birth defects and cancers, delineating the effects of EtOH on stem cell function is currently an active and urgent pursuit of scientific investigation to explicate some of the mechanisms contributing to EtOH toxicity. Stem cells represent a primordial, undifferentiated phase of development; thus encroachment on normal physiologic processes of differentiation into terminal lineages by EtOH can greatly alter the function of progenitors and terminally differentiated cells, leading to pathological consequences that manifest as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and cancers. In this review we explore the disruptive role of EtOH in differentiation of stem cells. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which EtOH alters differentiation-related gene expression and lineage specifications, thus modifying stem cells to promote pathological outcomes. We additionally review the effects of a reactive metabolite of EtOH, acetaldehyde (AcH), in causing both differentiation defects in stem cells as well as genomic damage that incites cellular aging and carcinogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

By lowering LDL particles as much as possible, ASCVD can be prevented. There seems to be no LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) threshold below which no further ASCVD prevention can be achieved. Furthermore, a low (an even very low) LDL-C appears to be safe. The new ESC/EAS guidelines based on these concepts are a step towards a benefit-based strategy by focusing on the clinical benefit that can be achieved by treating the cause of ASCVD. It is recommended to lower LDL-C as much as possible to prevent ASCVD, especially in high and very high-risk patients. With these new recommendations come recognition of the importance of combination therapies in high and very high-risk patients, first with statins and ezetimibe, and if needed with a PCSK9 inhibitor. The present paper is a review of some new concepts arising during the past 10 years in the field of lipidology and the description of what is new in the 2019 EAS/ESC guidelines.</AbstractText>"}

A Markov model was built to quantify fibrosis progression among the NAFLD and NASH populations, and predict disease burden up to 2030. Long-term trending of NAFLD prevalence was based on changes in the prevalence of adult obesity. Published estimates and surveillance data were applied to build and validate the model projections. The prevalence of NAFLD increased up to 2030 in tandem with projected increases in adult obesity. By 2030, there were an estimated 2,234,000 (1,918,000&amp;ndash;2,553,000) NAFLD cases, or 24.3% (20.9&amp;ndash;27.8%) of the total Swiss population (all ages). Increases in NASH cases were relatively greater than NAFLD cases. Incident cases of advanced liver disease are projected to increase by approximately 40% by 2030, and incident NAFLD liver deaths to increase from 580 deaths in 2018 to 820 deaths in 2030. Continued growth in obesity, in combination with an aging population, will result in increasing number of cases of advanced liver disease and mortality related to NAFLD and NASH. Slowing the growth in obesity and metabolic syndrome, along with future potential therapies, are required to reduce liver disease burden. &amp;nbsp.</AbstractText>"}

In humans, a deficit in its homeostatic control might lead to hyperglucemia and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which show a decreased ability to respond to and metabolize glucose. Previously, we have reported that high-glucose diets (HGD) induce alterations in triglyceride content, body size, progeny, and the mRNA accumulation of key regulators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (PLoS ONE 13(7): e0199888). Herein, we show that increasing amounts of glucose in the diet induce the swelling of both mitochondria in germ and muscle cells. Additionally, HGD alter the enzymatic activities of the different respiratory complexes in an intricate pattern. Finally, we observed a downregulation of ceramide synthases (hyl-1 and hyl-2) and antioxidant genes (gcs-1 and gst-4), while mitophagy genes (pink-1 and dct-1) were upregulated, probably as part of a mitohormetic mechanism in response to glucose toxicity.</AbstractText>"}

The mean age of the cohort was 78 years, 40% were male and 15% were Black. The mean sUMOD level was 127 ng/mL, uUMOD was 30 500 ng/mL and eGFR was 63 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> . Correlation between sUMOD and uUMOD, adjusted for eGFR was moderate (r = 0.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.21-0.33]). The correlation of eGFR with sUMOD (r = 0.44 [0.39-0.49]) was stronger than with uUMOD (r = 0.21 [0.15-0.27]). In multi-variable analysis adjusting sUMOD for uUMOD and vice versa, sUMOD was independently associated with eGFR (β = 1.3 [1.1-1.6]), log2 C-reactive protein (β = -4.2 [-6.8 to -1.6]) and male sex (β = -13.6 [-22.7 to -4.5]). In contrast, male sex was associated with higher uUMOD (β = 3700 [400-7000]), while diabetes (β = -6400 [-10 600 to -2100]) and hypertension (-4300 [-7500 to -1100]) were associated with lower uUMOD levels. We conclude that sUMOD is more strongly associated with eGFR compared with uUMOD. Correlates of sUMOD and uUMOD differ substantially, suggesting that apical and basolateral secretion may be differentially regulated.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this study we examined the usefulness of a dosimeter using the capacitance change of a barium titanate capacitor. As a basic property, it was confirmed that the dose linearity was good. With regard to dose rate characteristics and response to fractionated irradiation, capacitance change due to aging affects measurement accuracy, but online measurement of capacitance change immediately before irradiation can be performed to correct aging effects during irradiation.

However, the mechanism by which OXR1 defends against genome instability has not been elucidated. To clarify how OXR1 maintains genome stability, the effects of OXR1-depletion on genome stability were investigated in OXR1-depleted HeLa cells using gamma-rays (γ-rays). The OXR1-depleted cells had higher levels of superoxide and micronucleus (MN) formation than control cells after irradiation. OXR1-overexpression alleviated the increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and MN formation after irradiation. The increased MN formation in irradiated OXR1-depleted cells was partially attenuated by the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting that OXR1-depeletion increases ROS-dependent genome instability. We also found that OXR1-depletion shortened the duration of γ-ray-induced G2/M arrest. In the presence of the cell cycle checkpoint inhibitor caffeine, the level of MN formed after irradiation was similar between control and OXR1-depleted cells, demonstrating that OXR1-depletion accelerates MN formation through abrogation of G2/M arrest. In OXR1-depleted cells, the level of cyclin D1 protein expression was increased. Here we report that OXR1 prevents genome instability by cell cycle regulation as well as oxidative stress defense.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The present study aimed to investigate potential risk factors and neuropathological characteristics associated with LATE-NC. A sample of 616 autopsied participants (&gt;75 years at death), with TDP-43 immunohistochemical studies performed, was obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between demographic, clinical and neuropathological characteristics and LATE-NC (TDP-43 in amygdala, hippocampus, or entorhinal/inferior temporal cortex) (alpha = 0.05). Adjusted models indicated that ADNC, hippocampal sclerosis (HS), arteriolosclerosis, and limbic or amygdala-predominant Lewy body disease (LBD), but not other LBD subtypes, were associated with higher odds of LATE-NC, whereas congestive heart failure (CHF) and motor problems as first predominant symptom were associated with lower odds of LATE-NC. Our findings corroborate previous studies indicating associations between LATE-NC and ADNC, HS, and arteriolosclerosis. Novel findings suggest the association with LATE-NC is restricted to amygdala/limbic-predominant subtype of LBD, and a possible protective (or competing risk) association with CHF.

Paradoxically, estrogen replacement to this middle-aged group exacerbates stroke outcomes, while it is neuroprotective in adult females. Recent studies reveal an important role for the gut microbiome and gut metabolites in cardiovascular health, including stroke outcomes. To determine whether gut dysbiosis underlies stroke severity in reproductive senescent females, and underlies the anomalous effects of estrogen on stroke, we compared the gut microbiota and gut metabolites pre and post stroke in (a) gonadally intact adult and middle-aged females, (b) in ovariectomized and estrogen-treated (OVX+E) adult and OVX+E middle-aged females, and (c) in middle-aged OVX+E females after fecal microbiome transfer. Our data show significant gut dysbiosis in reproductive senescent females at baseline and after stroke as indicated by an elevated ratio of the major phyla, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F:B), reduced alpha diversity, and significant shifts in beta diversity as compared with adult females. Specific bacterial families were also altered as a result of reproductive aging, as well as gut metabolites, including elevated serum endotoxin levels and decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), with a concomitant increase in IL-17A, indicating that reproductive senescence significantly affects gut communities under pathologic conditions. Despite the differences in gonadally intact adult and middle-aged females, estrogen-treated ovariectomized (OVX+E) females of either age group displayed no differences in the major phyla, but there was increased abundance in specific bacterial taxa, including Prevotella and Lactobacillus. The SCFA butyrate was significantly reduced at baseline in the middle-aged OVX+E females, while circulating endotoxin LPS were elevated in this group after stroke, suggesting that gut metabolites were differently affected by estrogen treatment in the two age groups. A fecal transfer from adult OVX+E females to middle-aged OVX+E females significantly reduced infarct volume, improved behavioral recovery and transiently reduced IL-17A expression. These data provide the first evidence that microbial gut communities and metabolites are altered by reproductive senescence in female rats at baseline and after stroke, and suggest that estrogen may impact stroke recovery differently in adult and reproductive senescent females due to an age-specific effect on gut microbiota and metabolites.</AbstractText>"}

The risk of falling increases with fatigue and of importance is the ability to dorsiflex the foot through timely activation of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to ensure the foot clears the ground, or an obstacle, during the swing phase of walking. We, therefore, questioned whether the muscle spindle input to the motoneurons alters with ongoing fatigue in older people. We electrically stimulated the common peroneal nerve to assess the TA primary afferent efficacy using H-reflex before, immediately following and after a fatiguing maximal isometric contraction. M-response was kept unchanged throughout the experiment to ensure a similar stimulus intensity was delivered across time points. H-reflex increased significantly while the TA muscle was in a state of fatigue for the younger participants but tended to decrease with increasing age. The main contributor to the tonicity of TA muscle, i.e., excitatory synapses of spindle primary endings of motoneurons that innervate TA muscle, tend to lose their efficacy during fatigue in the older individuals but increased efficiency in the majority of the younger people. Since TA muscle is the main dorsiflexor of the foot and it needs to be active during the swing phase of stepping to prevent tripping, older individuals become more susceptible to falling when their muscles are fatigued. This finding may help improve devices/treatments to overcome the problem of tripping among older individuals.</AbstractText>"}

Crimson snapper scale peptides (CSSPs) obtained from crimson snapper scales by enzymatic hydrolysis exhibited significantly antioxidant activities to DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radicals in vitro. In vivo antioxidant and anti-aging effects of CSSPs on the Drosophila melanogaster aging model constructed by lard were investigated in this study. The results showed that CSSPs could prolong the mean lifespan, 50% survival days and the maximum lifespan of Drosophila, and especially when the concentration of CSSPs was increased to 6 mg mL-1, the mean lifespan of male and female Drosophila increased by 21.2% and 26.2%, respectively, indicating the effective life extension effect of CSSPs. Meanwhile, the addition of CSSPs effectively reduced the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonylation (PCO) and increased the levels of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) in Drosophila, which showed a significant dose dependence. Besides, the antioxidant-related genes SOD1, SOD2 and CAT were up-regulated in Drosophila when fed with diets containing CSSPs. In conclusion, CSSPs played an antioxidant and anti-aging role by reducing the accumulation of peroxide products and improving the activity of antioxidant enzymes, as well as by up-regulating the expression of antioxidant-related genes. The results suggest that CSSPs have potential to be used in the food and healthcare industries as potential food-borne antioxidant and anti-aging agents.</AbstractText>"}

Metatarsal fractures are particularly common in Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN), a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral neuropathy (PN). Neuropathic metatarsal fractures may be caused by an accelerated cortical bone osteolysis and may be reflected as geometric-derived strength estimates from standard foot radiographs. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine geometry and strength-derived estimates of the metatarsals in individuals with DM, PN, and CN compared with younger and older adult controls who were nondiabetic and nonneuropathic. We studied 62 participants: 20 young adult controls (YACs), 22 older adult controls (OACs), and 20 diagnosed with DMPN&amp;CN. From weight-bearing radiographs, we measured the outer diaphysis diameter and inner marrow diameter at the distal, middle, and proximal diaphysis sites of the second and fifth metatarsal. From these diameters, we derived strength estimates of combined cortical width (CCt.Wi), percent cortical area (%Ct.rA), buckling ratio (BR), moment of inertia (MOI), and section modulus (SM) at each site in both metatarsals. DMPN&amp;CN participants had an accelerated cortical thinning, decreased %Ct.Ar, increased BR, and lower MOI and SM compared with OACs and YACs. The OACs showed age-related decreases in CCt.Wi and % Ct.Ar, and increased BR. The BR demonstrated significant group × bone × site interaction with the distal fifth metatarsal in the DMPN&amp;CN group having the lowest bone strength. The BR in the distal fifth metatarsal of DMPN&amp;CN participants was 36% and 49% greater than in the OAC and YAC groups, respectively. DMPN&amp;CN participants have lower metatarsal bone strength estimates compared with younger and older adult controls.

With more cases of physical abuse and neglect in old age in sub-Saharan Africa, this study explored the views and positions of older people and community stakeholders like religious leaders on why physical elder abuse and neglect and preventive measures within community settings in Nigeria. An exploratory research design that consisted of two focus group discussions with older Yoruba men and women (60+) and six semi-structured interviews with religious leaders (Christianity, Islam, and Traditional) guided the study. Based on thematic analysis, the findings revealed that older persons and religious leaders have multiple interpretations of physical elder abuse and neglect. Social ills, poor economic situation, evil machinations, and stereotypes and misconceptions of old age and spirituality are possible explanations for physical abuse and neglect. The intersecting nature of the factors promoting vulnerability to physical abuse and neglect in later life also emerged in the preventive measures suggested by older persons and community members. As such, the participants affirmed that most older persons are becoming conscious of vulnerability to abuse and do contest actions, relationships, and contexts that can reduce their vulnerability and earn more social acceptance. Nonetheless, the participants expressed worries over the absence of policies and legal frameworks that can protect older people against physical abuse and neglect. More worrisome was the growing spread of social ills, stereotypes around old age, poverty in old age, witchcraft accusations and ageism. These developments are compounding ageing experiences, including physical abuse and neglect in urban spaces in Nigeria.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In rodents, sleep disruption causes microglial activation, inhibition of which improves cognition. However, data from humans are lacking. We studied participants in two cohort studies of older persons-the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. We assessed sleep fragmentation by actigraphy and related this to cognitive function, to neocortical microglial marker gene expression measured by RNA sequencing, and to the neocortical density of microglia assessed by immunohistochemistry. Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with higher neocortical expression of genes characteristic of aged microglia, and a higher proportion of morphologically activated microglia, independent of chronological age- and dementia-related neuropathologies. Furthermore, these were, in turn, associated with worse cognition. This suggests that sleep fragmentation is accompanied by accelerated microglial aging and activation, which may partially underlie its association with cognitive impairment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Since the mid-1800s, cites often relied on an integrated system of underground pipes, pumps, and other built infrastructure (termed gray infrastructure) to convey stormwater away from developed areas. Unfortunately, this gray infrastructure is aging and often exceeds its designed capacity. In an effort to alleviate issues related to excess stormwater, many urban areas across the United States are interested in using green infrastructure as a stopgap or supplement to inadequate gray infrastructure. Green infrastructure and other greenspace promote interception and/or infiltration of stormwater by using the natural hydrologic properties of soil and vegetation. Furthermore, there are numerous ancillary benefits, in addition to stormwater benefits, that make the use of greenspace desirable. Collectively, these ecosystem services can benefit multiple aspects of a community by providing benefits in a targeted manner. In this paper, we present a framework for balancing stormwater management against ancillary benefits of urban greenspace. The framework is structured around the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ecosystem service categories: provisioning, cultural, regulatory, and supporting services. The purpose is to help communities better manage their systems by 1) allowing stakeholders to prioritize and address their needs and concerns within a community, and 2) maximize the ecosystem service benefits received from urban greenspace.</AbstractText>"}

However, the structural and catalytic stabilities of these materials often suffer during the harsh conditions encountered in important reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)<sup>3-5</sup>. Here, we demonstrate that atomically thin Pt shells stabilize titanium tungsten carbide cores, even at highly oxidizing potentials. In situ, time-resolved experiments showed how the Pt coating protects the normally labile core against oxidation and dissolution, and detailed microscopy studies revealed the dynamics of partially and fully coated core-shell nanoparticles during potential cycling. Particles with complete Pt coverage precisely maintained their core-shell structure and atomic composition during accelerated electrochemical ageing studies consisting of over 10,000 potential cycles. The exceptional durability of fully coated materials highlights the potential of core-shell architectures using earth-abundant transition metal carbide (TMC) and nitride (TMN) cores for future catalytic applications.</AbstractText>"}

Sirt6 activation protects against metabolic and aging-related diseases, and Sirt6 inhibition is considered a cancer therapy. Available Sirt6 modulators show insufficient potency and specificity, and even partially contradictory Sirt6 effects were reported for the plant flavone quercetin. To understand Sirt6 modulation by quercetin-based compounds, we analysed their binding and activity effects on Sirt6 and other Sirtuin isoforms and solved crystal structures of compound complexes with Sirt6 and Sirt2. We find that quercetin activates Sirt6 via the isoform-specific binding site for pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines. Its inhibitory effect on other isoforms is based on an alternative binding site at the active site entrance. Based on these insights, we identified isoquercetin as a ligand that can discriminate both sites and thus activates Sirt6 with increased specificity. Furthermore, we find that quercetin derivatives that inhibit rather than activate Sirt6 exploit the same general Sirt6 binding site as the activators, identifying it as a versatile allosteric site for Sirt6 modulation. Our results thus provide a structural basis for Sirtuin effects of quercetin-related compounds and helpful insights for Sirt6-targeted drug development.</AbstractText>"}

Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) has been identified to be highly expressed in a variety of human malignancies. However, few studies have studied the expression of GPX1 and its biological functions in RCC. We attempted to assess the potential of GPX1 as a promising biomarker for RCC diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we analyzed and explored the public cancer databases (TCGA and ONCOMINE) to conclude that GPX1 is highly expressed in RCC. Meanwhile, we evaluated the expression of GPX1 at the levels of RCC cells and tissues to verify the results of the database. Moreover, high GPX1 levels were positively correlated with short overall survival time, distant metastasis, lymphatic metastasis, and tumor stage. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that high GPX1 levels could distinguish RCC patients from normal subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that high GPX1 levels predicted shorter overall survival time (p = 0.0009). Finally, the functional roles of GPX1 were examined using a GPX1 sh-RNA knockdown method in RCC cell lines. In summary, our results suggest that GPX1 may have the potential to serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for RCC patients. Moreover, targeting GPX1 may represent as a new therapeutic strategy and direction for RCC patients.</AbstractText>"}

We conducted an extensive study of wild-type mouse lenses 1-30 months of age to define common age-related changes. Biomechanical testing and morphometrics revealed an increase in lens volume and stiffness with age. Lens capsule thickness and peripheral fiber cell widths increased between 2 to 4 months of age but not further, and thus, cannot account for significant age-dependent increases in lens stiffness after 4 months. In lenses from mice older than 12 months, we routinely observed cataracts due to changes in cell structure, with anterior cataracts due to incomplete suture closure and a cortical ring cataract corresponding to a zone of compaction in cortical lens fiber cells. Refractive index measurements showed a rapid growth in peak refractive index between 1 to 6 months of age, and the area of highest refractive index is correlated with increases in lens nucleus size with age. These data provide a comprehensive overview of age-related changes in murine lenses, including lens size, stiffness, nuclear fraction, refractive index, transparency, capsule thickness and cell structure.

Correlation analysis between expression of these 17 miRNAs and patients' clinicopathological characteristics showed that miR-203 was down-regulated in esophageal carcinoma (EC) tissues and was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and poor overall survival. Overexpression of miR-203 significantly attenuated cellular proliferation, migration and invasion by EC cells in culture. Additionally, gene expression profiles and bioinformatics analysis revealed KIF5C to be a direct target of miR-203, and KIF5C overexpression partially counteracted the tumor inhibitory effects of miR-203 on EC cells. We also observed that miR-203, reduced KIFC5 protein levels, promoted cytoplasmic accumulation of Axin2, and reversed the invasive phenotype of EC cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that miR-203 is a tumor suppressor in EC cells and its expression level could potentially be used as a prognostic indicator for EC patient outcomes.</AbstractText>"}

Differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DE-ATGs) in GBM and normal samples were screened using TCGA. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed on DE-ATGs to identify the optimal prognosis-related genes. Consequently, NRG1 (HR=1.142, P=0.008), ITGA3 (HR=1.149, P=0.043), and MAP1LC3A (HR=1.308, P=0.014) were selected to establish the prognostic risk score model and validated in the CGGA validation cohort.

The autophagy signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Finally, a prognostic nomogram including the autophagy signature, age, pharmacotherapy, radiotherapy, and IDH mutation status was constructed, and TCGA/CGGA-based calibration plots indicated its excellent predictive performance.

Currently some of the most effective appreciation of biologic disease and drug response complexity is achieved using high-dimensionality (H-D) data streams from transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics, or epigenomic pipelines. Multiple H-D data sets are now common and freely accessible for complex diseases such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Over the last decade our ability to interrogate these high-dimensionality data streams has been profoundly enhanced through the development and implementation of highly effective bioinformatic platforms. Employing these computational approaches to understand the complexity of age-related diseases provides a facile mechanism to then synergize this pathologic appreciation with a similar level of understanding of therapeutic-mediated signaling. For informative pathology and drug-based analytics that are able to generate meaningful therapeutic insight across diverse data streams, novel informatics processes such as latent semantic indexing and topological data analyses will likely be important. Elucidation of H-D molecular disease signatures from diverse data streams will likely generate and refine new therapeutic strategies that will be designed with a cognizance of a realistic appreciation of the complexity of human age-related disease and drug effects. We contend that informatic platforms should be synergistic with more advanced chemical/drug and phenotypic cellular/tissue-based analytical predictive models to assist in either de novo drug prioritization or effective repurposing for the intervention of aging-related diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: All diseases, as well as pharmacological mechanisms, are far more complex than previously thought a decade ago. With the advent of commonplace access to technologies that produce large volumes of high-dimensionality data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), it is now imperative that effective tools to appreciate this highly nuanced data are developed. Being able to appreciate the subtleties of high-dimensionality data will allow molecular pharmacologists to develop the most effective multidimensional therapeutics with effectively engineered efficacy profiles.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</CopyrightInformation>"}

As such, it may provide a powerful tool for investigating the cerebral small vessels. However, further development and validation are necessary. This study aims, first, to validate a retrospectively-gated implementation of the DENSE method for assessing brain tissue pulsations as a physiological marker, and second, to use the acquired measurements to explore intracranial volume dynamics. We acquired repeated measurements of cerebral volumetric strain in 8 healthy subjects, and internally validated these measurements by comparing them to spinal CSF stroke volumes obtained in the same scan session. Peak volumetric strain was found to be highly repeatable between scan sessions. First/second measured peak volumetric strains were: (6.4 ​± ​1.7)x10<sup>-4</sup>/(6.7 ​± ​1.6)x10<sup>-4</sup> for whole brain, (9.5 ​± ​2.5)x10<sup>-4</sup>/(9.6 ​± ​2.4)x10<sup>-4</sup> for grey matter, and (4.4 ​± ​1.7)x10<sup>-4</sup>/(4.1 ​± ​0.8)x10<sup>-4</sup> for white matter. Grey matter showed significantly higher peak strain (p ​&lt; ​0.001) and earlier time-to-peak strain (p ​&lt; ​0.02) than white matter. An approximately linear relationship was found between CSF and brain tissue volume pulsations over the cardiac cycle (mean slope and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.88 ​± ​0.23 and 0.89 ​± ​0.07, respectively). The close similarity between CSF and brain tissue volume pulsations implies limited contributions from large intracranial vessel pulsations, providing further evidence for venous compression as an additional mechanism for maintaining stable intracranial pressures over the cardiac cycle. Cerebral pulsatility showed consistent inter-subject peak values in healthy subjects, and was strongly correlated to CSF stroke volumes. These results strengthen the potential of brain tissue volumetric strain as a means for investigating the intracranial dynamics of the ageing brain in normal or diseased states.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Metformin, which is currently used as a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has recently demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD, both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we explore the neuroprotective potential of metformin based on emerging evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies. Regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms, metformin has been shown to inhibit α-synuclein (SNCA) phosphorylation and aggregation, prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, attenuate oxidative stress, modulate autophagy mainly via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, as well as prevent neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Overall, the neuroprotective effects of metformin in PD pathogenesis present a novel promising therapeutic strategy that might overcome the limitations of current PD treatment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanistic and regulatory aspect of this enzyme needs to be explored. SIRT7 contains a conserved catalytic core with long flanking N- and C-terminal extensions. We find that the N terminus is involved in substrate binding, thus also in its dual enzyme activity i.e. deacetylation and ADP ribosylation. The C-terminus is not essential for its catalysis. Mutation of certain residues at the active site suggests that mono ADP-ribosylation and deacetylation are two distinct activities of SIRT7. In this study, we also find that the SIRT7 enzyme can specifically transfer a single moiety of ADP ribose on other nuclear proteins, with a preference for NAD<sup>+</sup>. For this, the ADPr transfer follows the enzymatic reaction mechanism. Nicotinamide and certain metal ions have a significant negative effect on this mono ADP ribosylation process. A comparison of these dual activities suggests SIRT7's preference for the mono ADPr transfer over its deacetylation of H3K18Ac. Mono ADP ribosylation in cells is often linked to different metabolic disease conditions. This kind of modification of transcription factors, p53 and ELK4 by SIRT7 may play a key role in maintaining the tumor phenotype. Thus, SIRT7 becomes an important therapeutic hotspot for drug designing against several diseases. Finally, we can also relate SIRT7 to the DNA repair process through ADP ribosylation of one of its key players, PARP1. Here, SIRT7 positively regulates the PARP1 activity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation>"}

NAFLD can range in severity from steatosis to fibrotic steatohepatitis and is a major cause of hepatic morbidity. However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD in naturally aged animals is unclear. Herein, we performed a comprehensive study of lipid content and inflammatory signature of livers in 19-month-old aged female mice. These animals exhibited increased body and liver weight, hepatic triglycerides, and inflammatory gene expression compared with 3-month-old young controls. The aged mice also had a significant increase in F4/80<sup>+</sup> hepatic macrophages, which coexpressed CD11b, suggesting a circulating monocyte origin. A global knockout of the receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein (CCR2) prevented excess steatosis and inflammation in aging livers but did not reduce the number of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages, suggesting changes in macrophage accumulation precede or are independent from chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-CCR2 signaling in the development of age-related NAFLD. RNA sequencing further elucidated complex changes in inflammatory and metabolic gene expression in the aging liver. In conclusion, we report a previously unknown accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages in aged livers with robust inflammatory and metabolic transcriptomic changes.

Disturbances in such symbiosis is prominently correlated with a variety of diseases affecting the modern society of humans including cardiovascular diseases, which are the number one contributors to human mortality. Given that a hallmark of all cardiovascular diseases is changes in vascular function, we hypothesized that depleting microbiota from a holobiont would induce vascular dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, young mice of both sexes raised in germ-free conditions were examined vascular contractility and structure. Here we observed that male and female germ-free mice presented a decrease in contraction of resistance arteries. These changes were more pronounced in germ-free males than in germ-free females mice. Furthermore, there was a distinct change in vascular remodeling between males and females germ-free mice. Resistance arteries from male germ-free mice demonstrated increased vascular stiffness, as shown by the leftward shift in the stress-strain curve and inward hypotrophic remodeling, a characteristic of chronic reduction in blood flow. On the other hand, resistance arteries from germ-free female mice were similar in the stress-strain curves to that of conventionally raised mice, but were distinctly different and showed outward hypertrophic remodeling, a characteristic seen in aging. Interestingly, we observed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from bone marrow derived neutrophils is blunted in female germ-free mice, but it is exacerbated in male germ-free mice. In conclusion, these observations indicate that commensal microbiota of a holobiont are central to maintain proper vascular function and structure homeostasis, especially in males.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, the development of fluorescent pH-sensitive mitochondrial reporters has greatly facilitated the monitoring of mitophagy by distinguishing between cytosolic mitochondria or those delivered to acidic lysosomes. We recently published the mito-QC reporter, which consists of a mitochondrial outer membrane-localised tandem mCherry-GFP tag. This allows the quantification of mitophagy via the increase in red-only mCherry signal that arises when the GFP signal is quenched upon mitochondrial delivery to lysosomes. Here we develop a macro for FIJI, the mito-QC Counter, and describe its use to allow reliable and consistent semi-automated quantification of mitophagy. In this methods article we describe step-by-step how to detect and quantify mitophagy and show that mitophagy levels can be reliably calculated in different cell lines and under distinct stimuli. Finally, we show that the mito-QC Counter can be used to quantify mitophagy in tissues of mito-QC transgenic mice. We demonstrate that mitophagy levels in skeletal muscle correlates with glycolytic activity. Our present data show that the mito-QC Counter macro for FIJI enables the robust quantification of mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Yet how NRF2 participates in maintaining synaptic, mitochondrial and cognitive function has not been fully elucidated. This study investigates how loss of NRF2 affects neuronal metabolism, synaptic density and cognitive performance in aged mice. Dendritic arborization as well as synaptic and mitochondrial gene expression was evaluated in hippocampal neurons isolated from mice lacking NRF2 (NRF2KO) and from wild-type (WT) C57BL6 mice. Mitochondrial function of these neurons was evaluated using the Seahorse XF platform. Additionally learning, memory and executive function were assessed in 20 month old NRF2KO and age-matched WT mice using conditioned fear response (CFR) and odor discrimination reversal learning (ODRL) tests. Hippocampal bioenergetics was profiled using mitochondria isolated from these animals and tissue was harvested for assessment of mitochondrial and synaptic genes. NRF2KO neurons had reduced dendritic complexity and diminished synaptic gene expression. This was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function and decreased mitochondrial gene expression. Similar mitochondrial deficits were observed in the brains of aged NRF2KO mice. These animals also had significantly impaired cognitive performance and reduced synaptic gene expression as well. These data point to a role for NRF2 in maintaining mitochondrial and cognitive function during aging and suggest that the transcription factor may be a viable target for cognitive enhancing interventions. Because mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment also occur together in many neurodegenerative conditions there may be broad therapeutic potential of NRF2 activating agents.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Brain age indicates whether an individual's brain appears 'older' than age-matched healthy peers, suggesting that they may have experienced a higher cumulative exposure to brain insults or were more impacted by those pathological insults. However, contemporary brain age models include older participants with amyloid pathology in their training sets and thus may be confounded when studying Alzheimer's disease (AD). We showed that amyloid status is a critical feature for brain age prediction models. We trained a model on T1-weighted MRI images participants without amyloid pathology. MRI data were processed to estimate gray matter density voxel-wise, which were then used to predict chronological age. Our model performed accurately comparable to previous models. Notably, we demonstrated more significant differences between AD diagnostic groups than other models. In addition, our model was able to delineate significant differences in brain age relative to chronological age between cognitively normal individuals with and without amyloid. Incorporation of amyloid status in brain age prediction models ultimately improves the utility of brain age as a biomarker for AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

During acquisition, a neutral face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an electrical stimulus, whereas another face (unconditioned stimulus, CS-) was unpaired. Conditioned responses were measured by unconditioned stimulus expectancy, valence, and skin conductance. Compared to healthy controls, both patient groups showed less differential (CS+ vs. CS-) fear acquisition across all measures. Patients further displayed slowed extinction indexed by higher unconditioned stimulus expectancy and reduced positive valence for CS+, declining from aMCI to AD.

Methylene blue treatment rescued Caspase-6-induced episodic and spatial memory deficits measured by novel object recognition and Barnes maze, respectively. Methylene blue improved synaptic function of hippocampal CA1 neurons since theta-burst long-term potentiation (LTP), measured by field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in acute brain slices, was successfully induced in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway in methylene blue-treated, but not in vehicle-treated, Caspase-6 mice.

Sense and antisense transcripts of the expansions are translated by repeat-associated non-AUG translation into five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Of these, the polyGR, polyPR and, to a lesser extent, polyGA DPRs are neurotoxic, with polyGA the most abundantly detected DPR in patient tissue. Trans-cellular transmission of protein aggregates has recently emerged as a major driver of toxicity in various neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro evidence suggests that the C9 DPRs can spread. However, whether this phenomenon occurs under more complex in vivo conditions remains unexplored. Here, we used the adult fly brain to investigate whether the C9 DPRs can spread in vivo upon expression in a subset of neurons. We found that only polyGA can progressively spread throughout the brain, which accumulates in the shape of aggregate-like puncta inside recipient cells. Interestingly, GA transmission occurred as early as 3 days after expression induction. By comparing the spread of 36, 100 and 200 polyGA repeats, we found that polyGA spread is enhanced upon expression of longer GA DPRs. Transmission of polyGA is greater in older flies, indicating that age-associated factors exacerbate the spread. These data highlight a unique propensity of polyGA to spread throughout the brain, which could contribute to the greater abundance of polyGA in patient tissue. In addition, we present a model of early GA transmission that is suitable for genetic screens to identify mechanisms of spread and its consequences in vivo.</AbstractText>"}

Previous clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia have yielded disappointing results. However, recent studies of the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in AD have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function. Because few rTMS trials have been conducted in MCI, we designed a trial to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Yet, in both MCI and AD, we know little about what site of stimulation would be ideal for improving cognitive function. Therefore, two cortical sites will be investigated in this trial: (1) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which has been well studied for treatment of major depressive disorder; and (2) the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a novel site with connectivity to AD-relevant limbic regions.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS/DESIGN' NlmCategory='METHODS'>In this single-site trial, we plan to enroll 99 participants with single or multi-domain amnestic MCI.

ICIs are monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between molecules that normally inhibit the function of effector T cells, ultimately increasing their ability to destroy cancer cells but also causing immune-related adverse events, such as hypophysitis. Ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 blocker, was the first ICI approved from the Food and Drug Administration for advanced melanoma patients in 2011. Several additional ICIs targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 are now used in many clinical trials, making it important for physicians to recognize and treat hypophysitis adequately.<b>Areas covered</b>: This review will provide insights into the mechanisms of pituitary toxicity, highlight the complexity of clinical phenotypes of ICI hypophysitis, and offer practical recommendations.<b>Expert opinion</b>: ICI hypophysitis differs in many respects from primary hypophysitis, and also according to the type of ICI that caused it. Its pathogenesis remains unknown, although the expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on pituitary cells could play a role. The diagnosis is mainly clinical since there are no specific serological markers and MRI findings are subtle. The treatment is based on long-term hormone replacement and does not typically require discontinuation of immunotherapy.</AbstractText>"}

Despite concluding that their own recommendations were 'weak and based on low certainty evidence', the authors were happy to recommend that there is 'No need to reduce red or processed meat consumption for good health.' What we actually know is that: red meat consumption is an order of magnitude higher now than through most of human history; red meat is a probable, and processed meat is a definite, human carcinogen; saturated fat increases risk of heart disease; and vegans and vegetarians have better lipid profiles, lower risk of chronic disease, and greater longevity than meat eaters. There are other consequences of meat consumption too, including: altered sexual development; widespread antimicrobial resistance; and disrupted planetary health, including depletion of aquifers, groundwater pollution, and increased greenhouse gases.

Sarcopenia in patients with malignancies is a multifactorial problem, caused by chronic inflammation associated with malignancies, aging, nutritional deficiency, inactivity, and antineoplastic treatment. Sarcopenia is present in approximately 30-60% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). It is an objective, measurable predictor of survival and systemic toxicity. The detection and quantification of sarcopenia in routine clinical practice does not require any particular test beyond routine imaging. Initial results show that regimens used to treat mCRC can have differential effect on skeletal mass. SMM tends to decrease during intensive regimens. Conversely, SMM tends to increase during low-intensity maintenance therapy or in patients with stable disease. The status of the underlying disease is another determinant of muscle mass changes, and SMM decreases during disease progression. Third-line therapy with regorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, results in more skeletal muscle loss than trifluridine/tipiracil chemotherapy, which may have consequences for the survival or quality of life of patients. Larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate the importance of SMM changes during mCRC treatment.

However, it is difficult to determine the moisture content inside the transformer polymer insulation without destroying it, so that the model parameters cannot be confirmed. Such limitation greatly restricts its application. It is interesting to note that as long as the moisture content of the transformer polymer insulation could be characterized (replaced) by a certain feature parameter, the above issue will be solved naturally. The existing researches indicate that the Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) is sensitive to moisture. Consequently, the feature parameter that could characterize the moisture inside transformer polymer insulation (extracted from the FDS curve) can be used to report a modified aging kinetics model, which could perform the aging condition prediction of transformer polymer insulation under various test conditions, including aging duration, aging temperature, and initial moisture. In that respect, the average relative error of prediction results of prepared samples is equal to 7.41%, which reveals that the reported model might be serviced as a potential tool for the aging condition prediction of transformer polymer insulation.</AbstractText>"}

Hence, knowledge on how the foam behaves under multiaxial stresses is of great importance for the design as well as for aging predictions of the network. It is known that cell shape anisotropy in polymeric foams leads to anisotropy in its mechanical properties. In this study, we evaluate and quantify the microstructural anisotropy of PU foam from pre-insulated pipes as well as its mechanical behaviour under compression in the three orthogonal directions. We cover rigid and flexible PU foam, batch and continuous manufacturing, and different pipe diameters. The results were compared with those predicted by available rectangular and Kelvin cell shape models. We have found that PU from pre-insulated pipes is orthotropic and present stronger anisotropy than that typically found in PU slabs. The traditional bonded pipes under consideration behaved in a similar way. However, when comparing the two flexible pipes in this study, despite no significant differences in cell shape anisotropy were found, a significantly different behaviour for the E modulus ratio was observed. This shows that while the manufacturing process exerts the main influence on cell shape anisotropy, to explain the difference in stiffness behaviour other factors need to be taken into consideration, such as cell size and cell size variability.</AbstractText>"}

The use of anti-oxidants, such as lignin, could be used to delay oxidative aging and to extend the lifetime of asphalt pavements. In this study, the chemical and rheological effect of lignin on bitumen was evaluated by using a single dosage organsolv lignin (10 wt.% dosage). A pressure aging vessel (PAV) was used to simulate the long-term aging process after performing the standard short-term aging procedure, and the lignin-modified bituminous binders were characterized by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). From the ESEM results, the uniform microstructure was observed, indicating that the addition of lignin did not affect the worm structure of bitumen. Based on the FTIR test results, lignin-modified bitumen showed that a lower number of carbonyl and sulfoxide compounds were generated after aging than for neat bitumen. Based on the linear amplitude sweep (LAS) results, the addition of lignin slightly reduced the fatigue life of bitumen. From the frequency sweep results, it showed that lignin in bitumen acts as a modifier since the physical interaction between lignin and bitumen predominantly affects the material rheology. Overall, lignin could be a promising anti-oxidant due to its economic and environmental benefits.</AbstractText>"}

In particular, atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure show a steep increase in incidence and healthcare costs due to the ageing population. Although research revealed novel insights in pathways driving cardiac disease, the exact underlying mechanisms have not been uncovered so far. Emerging evidence indicates that derailed proteostasis (i.e., the homeostasis of protein expression, function and clearance) is a central component driving cardiac disease. Within proteostasis derailment, key roles for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress have been uncovered. Here, we describe the concept of ER and mitochondrial stress and the role of interactions between the ER and mitochondria, discuss how imbalance in the interactions fuels cardiac ageing and cardiac disease (including AF), and finally assess the potential of drugs directed at conserving the interaction as an innovative therapeutic target to improve cardiac function.</AbstractText>"}

The application of artificial aging significantly improves their mechanical properties by precipitation hardening. However, commercial alloys very often contain different amounts of elements such as Si and Fe that make the evolution of the microstructure harder to control. Large intermetallic particles can influence the overall results of heat treatment and cause deterioration of material properties. The authors decided to examine changes in the microstructure of three commercial 2024 alloys with varying chemical compositions by applying three different types of aging treatments. The results show considerable differences in the amount, size and morphologies of the precipitates. Second-phase Al<sub>2</sub>Cu and Al<sub>2</sub>CuMg precipitates were identified in one of the alloys. Other interesting types of multiphase particles were discovered in alloys with higher Si contents. The results show that even small variations in the composition can lead to a completely different microstructure.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, accurate monitoring of weight and body mass index (BMI) is important to help guide the management of IIH patients.

UV-B exposure mediated photodamage (photo-aging/photo-carcinogenesis) to human skin is caused due to several physiological events at tissue, cellular and molecular levels that lead to impairment of skin function and integrity. In the present study, we investigated the protective role of Trigonelline (TG) against UV-B induced photo-damage in Human Dermal Fibroblasts (Hs68 cells) and Balb/C mice. We exposed human skin fibroblasts and Balb/C mice to UV-B radiation and evaluated various parameters of cellular damage, including, oxidative stress, cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels, apoptotic and ER-stress marker proteins. We found that UV-B irradiation induced ROS generation lead to the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium and increased the expression of ER stress protein markers (phosphorylated elf2α, CHOP, ATF4) as well as apoptotic protein markers (Bcl<sub>2</sub>, Bax and caspase-9) in a dose and time dependent manner in Hs68 cells. We then determined the effect of TG treatment on UV-B -induced cell death in Hs68 cells and observed that cells exposed to UV-B radiation and treated with TG had a significantly higher survival rate compared to cells exposed to UV-B radiation alone. TG treatment successfully reduced oxidative stress; restored Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and re-established the ER function and prevented apoptotic cell death process. Our results suggest that TG can be used as a potential therapeutic/cosmeceutic agent in preventing skin photo-damage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

According to the Neural Theory of Visual Attention, vSTM depends on the structural connectivity between posterior thalamus and visual occipital cortices (PT-OC).

To do so, 66 individuals aged 20-77 years were assessed by diffusion-weighted imaging used for probabilistic tractography and performed a psychophysical whole-report task of briefly presented letter arrays, from which vSTM capacity estimates were derived. We found reduced vSTM capacity, and aberrant PT-OC connection probability in aging. Critically, age modified the relationship between vSTM capacity and PT-OC connection probability: in younger adults, vSTM capacity was negatively correlated with PT-OC connection probability while in older adults, this association was positive. Furthermore, age modified the microstructure of PT-OC tracts suggesting that the inversion of the association between PT-OC connection probability and vSTM capacity with aging might reflect age-related changes in white-matter properties. Accordingly, our results demonstrate that age-related differences in vSTM capacity links with the microstructure and connectivity of PT-OC tracts.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Promisingly, current tools can be complemented by computational decision-support methods to objectively analyze multidimensional measures and increase diagnostic confidence. Yet, widespread application of these tools cannot be recommended unless they are proven to perform consistently and reproducibly across samples from different countries. We implemented machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the prediction power of neurocognitive biomarkers (behavioral and imaging measures) for classifying two neurodegenerative conditions -Alzheimer Disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)- across three different countries (&gt;200 participants). We use machine-learning tools integrating multimodal measures such as cognitive scores (executive functions and cognitive screening) and brain atrophy volume (voxel based morphometry from fronto-temporo-insular regions in bvFTD, and temporo-parietal regions in AD) to identify the most relevant features in predicting the incidence of the diseases. In the Country-1 cohort, predictions of AD and bvFTD became maximally improved upon inclusion of cognitive screenings outcomes combined with atrophy levels. Multimodal training data from this cohort allowed predicting both AD and bvFTD in the other two novel datasets from other countries with high accuracy (&gt;90%), demonstrating the robustness of the approach as well as the differential specificity and reliability of behavioral and neural markers for each condition. In sum, this is the first study, across centers and countries, to validate the predictive power of cognitive signatures combined with atrophy levels for contrastive neurodegenerative conditions, validating a benchmark for future assessments of reliability and reproducibility.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Two patients with Alzheimer's disease are reported with clinically suspected NCSE presenting in the emergency setting who were diagnosed using arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) sequences. CASE REPORT In Case 1, a 69-year-old woman with mild Alzheimer's disease and diabetes presented with acute worsening of cognitive status and fluctuating level of consciousness. In Case 2, a 70-year-old man with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and hypertension presented with acute loss of consciousness and left hemiparesis, without evidence of hypoglycemia or a hypertensive crisis. In both cases, ASL-MRI perfusion images showed focal cerebral hyperperfusion in the posterior cingulate and parietal associative cortex, which involved neurodegenerative areas associated with epilepsy in early Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, the patients developed generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures that lasted for 5 minutes or more, which indicated the emergence of status epilepticus that developed from the initial presentation of NCSE. In both cases, electroencephalogram (EEG) findings confirmed that the seizures were controlled by intravenous administration of antiepileptic drugs. Both patients discharged home from the hospital without recurrence of seizures, between 10-12 days after the onset of symptoms.

The functions of hematoma-derived exosomes were evaluated in a rat model of acute subdural hematoma (SDH). The hematoma-derived exosomes inhibited hematoma absorption and exacerbated neurological deficits in SDH rats. We examined the effects of the exosomes on angiogenesis and cell permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Septic AKI was induced through 18 hours of cecal ligation and puncture. AKI occurred during the early stage of sepsis, as evidenced by increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, pathological changes, renal fibrosis and renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, accompanied by macrophage infiltration and M1 macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory cytokine (<i>Il-6</i> and <i>Tnf-α</i>) generation in renal tissues. Aerosol inhalation of the HRS increased anti-inflammatory cytokine (<i>Il-4</i> and <i>Il-13</i>) mRNA levels in renal tissues and promoted macrophage polarization to the M2 type, which generated additional anti-inflammatory cytokines (<i>Il-10</i> and <i>Tgf-β</i>). Ultimately, aerosol inhalation of HRS protected the kidneys and increased survival among septic mice. HRS was confirmed to promote M2 macrophage polarization in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

Lack of effective pharmacotherapies for SCI is largely attributable to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. Caspase recruitment domain family member 6 (CARD6) was initially suggested to be a protein playing significant role in NF-κB activation. However, the effects of CARD6 on SCI progression remain unknown. In this study, the wild type (CARD6+/+), CARD6 knockout (CARD6-/-) and CARD6 transgenic (TG) mice were subjected to a SCI model in vivo, and in vitro experiments were conducted by treating microglia cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, we identified CARD6 as a suppressor of SCI in mice. CARD6 knockout significantly accelerated functional deficits, neuron death and glia activation, whereas CARD6 overexpression resulted in the opposite effects. Both in vivo and in vitro SCI models suggested that CARD6 knockout markedly promoted apoptosis by increasing Cyto-c release to cytosol from mitochondria and activating Caspase-3 signaling. In addition, CARD6 knockout mice exhibited stronger inflammatory response after SCI, as evidenced by the significantly elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, which was largely through enhancing the activation of NF-κB signaling.</AbstractText>"}

In the MEA Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/C, after 5000 ADT-rec (rectangle accelerated durability test) cycles, unlike the MEA Pt/C, there was no oxidation of Pt. In contrast, Co oxidized and dissolved over a wide range of the cathode layer (∼70% of the initial Co amount). The larger the size of the cracks and pores in the MEA Pt/C and the smaller the ratio of Pt/ionomer of cracks and pores, the faster the rate of catalyst degradation. In contrast, there was no correlation between the size or Co/ionomer ratio of the cracks and pores and the Co dissolution of the MEA Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/C. It was shown that Co dissolved in the electrolyte region had an octahedral Co<sup>2+</sup>-O<sub>6</sub> structure, based on a 150 nm × 150 nm nano-XAFS analysis. It was also shown that its existence suppressed the oxidation and dissolution of Pt. The MEA Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/C after 10,000 ADT-rec cycles had many cracks and pores in the cathode electrocatalyst layer, and about 90% of Co had been dissolved and removed from the cathode layer. We discovered a metallic Pt-Co alloy band in the electrolyte region of 300-400 nm from the cathode edge and square planar Pt<sup>2+</sup>-O<sub>4</sub> species and octahedral Co<sup>2+</sup>-O<sub>6</sub> species in the area between the cathode edge and the Pt-Co band. The transition of Pt and Co chemical species in the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/C cathode electrocatalyst in the MEA during the degradation process, as well as a fuel cell deterioration suppression process by Co were visualized for the first time at the nano scale using the same-view nano-XAFS/STEM-EDS combination technique that can measure the MEA under a humid N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere while maintaining the working environment for a fuel cell.</AbstractText>"}

Longitudinal studies have provided mixed results regarding the within-individual repeatability of telomere length. While some studies suggest telomere length to be highly dynamic and sensitive to resource-demanding or stressful conditions, others suggest that between-individual differences are mostly present from birth and relatively little affected by the later environment. This dichotomy could arise from differences between species, but also from methodological issues. In our study, we used the highly reliable Terminal Restriction Fragment analysis method to measure telomeres over a 10-year period in adults of a long-lived seabird, the common tern (Sterna hirundo). Telomeres shortened with age within individuals. The individual repeatability of age-dependent telomere length was high (&gt;0.53), and independent of the measurement interval (i.e., one vs. six years). A small (R<sup>2</sup>  = .01), but significant part of the between-individual variation in telomere length was, however, explained by the number of fledglings produced in the previous year, while reproduction in years prior to the previous year had no effect. We confirmed that age-dependent telomere length predicted an individual's remaining lifespan. Overall, our study suggests that the majority of between-individual variation in adult telomere length is consistent across adult life, and that a smaller part of the variation can be explained by dynamic factors, such as reproduction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the expected change in graft size and the dependence on patient characteristics are currently not well described. The purpose of this study was to determine the effective change in hamstring graft diameter and reliance on patient characteristics when intraoperatively converting a four-strand hamstring autograft into a five-strand configuration during an ACL reconstruction. A prospective, paired cohort study design was used to measure individual hamstring autograft diameter intraoperatively using traditional four-strand configuration followed by a five-strand configuration. All hamstring tendons included were long enough to consider a five-strand configuration. Five-strand hamstring autograft increased graft diameter in all patients. Hamstring tendon graft diameter increased by an average of 0.99 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-1.11) in the five-strand configuration compared with the traditional four-strand configuration (mean: 7.8 mm). There was no significant difference in the average increase in graft diameter between males (1.04 mm) and females (0.92 mm) (<i>p</i> = 0.323). Eighty-three percent (95% CI: 57.8-95.6) of average graft diameters ≤ 8 mm in the four-strand configuration achieved an average graft diameter of &gt;8 mm in the five-strand configuration, and 70% (95% CI: 35.4- 91.9) of four-strand configuration average diameters &lt; 8 mm achieved an average graft diameter &gt; 8.0 mm in the five-strand configuration. Five-strand hamstring autograft reliably increased intraoperative hamstring tendon autograft diameter, with an average of 1 mm, compared with traditional four-strand configuration.

Though a strong evidence base supports the nutritional value of animal-derived dietary proteins, mounting challenges associated with sustainability of these proteins have led to calls for the investigation of alternative, non-animal-derived dietary protein sources. Mycoprotein is a sustainably produced, protein-rich, high-fiber, whole food source derived from the fermentation of fungus. Initial investigations in humans demonstrated that mycoprotein consumption can lower circulating cholesterol concentrations. Recent data also report improved acute postprandial glycemic control and a potent satiety effect following mycoprotein ingestion. It is possible that these beneficial effects are attributable to the amount and type of dietary fiber present in mycoprotein. Emerging data suggest that the amino acid composition and bioavailability of mycoprotein may also position it as a promising dietary protein source to support skeletal muscle protein metabolism. Mycoprotein may be a viable dietary protein source to promote training adaptations in athletes and the maintenance of muscle mass to support healthy aging. Herein, current evidence underlying the metabolic effects of mycoprotein is reviewed, and the key questions to be addressed are highlighted.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

It's commonly accepted that inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and cellular senescence participate in the progress of OA. Protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a member of the G-protein coupled receptors, is involved in the regulation of various inflammation diseases. Previous studies have identified PAR2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of OA. Here, we investigated the role of PAR2 antagonist AZ3451 in inflammation response, apoptosis, autophagy and cellular senescence during OA. We confirmed that PAR2 expression was significantly up-regulated in OA articular cartilage tissues as well as in interleukin 1β (IL-1β) stimulated chondrocytes. We demonstrated AZ3451 could prevent the IL-1β-induced inflammation response, cartilage degradation and premature senescence in chondrocytes. Further study showed that AZ3451 attenuated chondrocytes apoptosis by activating autophagy in vitro. The P38/MAPK, NF-κB and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were involved in the protective effect of AZ3451. In vivo, we found that intra-articular injection of AZ3451 could ameliorate the surgery induced cartilage degradation in rat OA model. Our work provided a better understanding of the mechanism of PAR2 in OA, and indicated that PAR2 antagonist AZ3451 might serve as a promising strategy for OA treatment.</AbstractText>"}

NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammatory infiltration was determined to participate in NAFLD. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was recently confirmed as an essential regulator for apoptosis in cells. However, the role of XIAP in HFD-induced NAFLD is still not understood. Here, XIAP was characterized with respect to HFD-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation <i>in vivo</i> and palmitate (PA)-treated cells <i>in vitro</i>. After HFD administration, hepatic injury was confirmed via histological assessment (grading and staging of NAFLD) and biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, and reduced antioxidant activity. Up-regulated hepatic dysfunction were further indicated by elevated dyslipidemia, lipid accumulation, and decreased fatty acid β-oxidation associated gene expression. Moreover, in the absence of XIAP, NLRP3 signaling activated by HFD-triggered oxidative stress was up-regulated, accompanied by reduction in antioxidants including HO-1, NQO-1, GST, SOD and Nrf2 activity. The detrimental effects of XIAP blocking on hepatic steatosis and related pathologies were also confirmed in PA-treated mouse liver cells. In contrast, overexpression of XIAP by transfection <i>in vitro</i> restrained PA-stimulated hepatic steatosis by suppression of oxidative stress, NLRP3 related inflammatory response, and impairment of Nrf2 activity, further alleviating abnormal metabolic disorder associated NAFLD. Taken together, the present study helped to elucidate how HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was regulated by XIAP, possibly via the inhibition of NLRP3 signaling and oxidative stress injury.</AbstractText>"}

This pilot study aimed to assess whether therapeutic exercises supplemented by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation induces a greater hypoalgesic effect than therapeutic exercises supplemented by sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, in an elderly population suffering from chronic pain.<b>Materials and methods:</b> Eighteen elderly participants suffering from chronic pain completed a therapeutic exercise program consisting of 45-min group sessions administered twice a week for 4 weeks. Half of the participants received real transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation during the exercise sessions, while the others received sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Participants completed pain questionnaires (McGill Pain Questionnaire, Brief Pain Inventory, Beck Depression Index) before and after the intervention, and recorded their pain levels on an 11-point numerical rating scale before and after each session (Clinical Trial.Gov ID: NCT02445677).<b>Results and conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that supplementing exercise sessions with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation does not improve the long-term outcomes of elderly patients suffering from chronic pain, but does induce short-term hypoalgesia during exercise sessions. Our study also offers valuable guidelines for the implementation of a future and adequately powered study looking at this research question.Implications for rehabilitationThe application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation during exercises is well tolerated by elderly individuals suffering from chronic pain.Supplementing exercises with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation does not seem to improve general outcome in elderly suffering from chronic pain.Notwithstanding, the addition of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tends to produce a marked hypoalgesic effect during the exercise sessions, an effect that could prompt indirect benefits for pain patients.</AbstractText>"}

To focus on interactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane, we generated RPE from AMD patients and used an altered extracellular matrix (ECM) that models aged Bruch's membrane. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from fibroblasts isolated from AMD patients or age-matched (normal) controls. RPE derived from iPSCs were analyzed by morphology, marker expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and phagocytosis of rod photoreceptor outer segments. Cell attachment and viability was tested on nitrite-modified ECM, a typical modification of aged Bruch's membrane. DNA microarrays with hierarchical clustering and analysis of mitochondrial function were used to elucidate possible mechanisms for the observed phenotypes. Differentiated RPE displayed cell-specific morphology and markers. The TER and phagocytic capacity were similar among iPSC-derived RPE cultures. However, distinct clusters were found for the transcriptomes of AMD and control iPSC-derived RPE. AMD-derived iPSC-RPE downregulated genes responsible for metabolic-related pathways and cell attachment. AMD-derived iPSC-RPE exhibited reduced mitochondrial respiration and ability to attach and survive on nitrite-modified ECM. Cells that did attach induced the expression of complement genes. Despite reprogramming, iPSC derived from AMD patients yielded RPE with a transcriptome that is distinct from that of age-matched controls. When challenged with an AMD-like modification of Bruch's membrane, AMD-derived iPSC-RPE activated the complement immune system.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

PTOA is a growing problem in health care due to the lack of effective therapies combined with an aging population with high activity levels. Recently, acute mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cellular respiration have been associated with cartilage degeneration after injury. This finding is particularly important because recently developed mitoprotective drugs, including SS peptides, can preserve mitochondrial structure and function after acute injury in other tissues. It is not known, however, if cartilage injury induces rapid structural changes in mitochondria, to what degree mitochondrial dysfunction in cartilage depends on the mechanics of injury or the time frame over which such dysfunction develops. Similarly, it is unknown if SS-peptide treatment can preserve mitochondrial structure and function after cartilage injury. Here, we combined fast camera elastography, longitudinal fluorescence assays, and computer vision techniques to track the fates of thousands of individual cells. Our results show that impact induces mechanically dependent mitochondrial depolarization within a few minutes after injury. Electron microscopy revealed that impact causes rapid structural changes in mitochondria that are related to reduced mitochondrial function, namely, fission and loss of cristae structure. We found that SS-peptide treatment prior to impact protects the mitochondrial structure and preserves mitochondrial function at levels comparable with that of unimpacted control samples. Overall, this study reveals the vital role of mitochondria in mediating cartilage's peracute (within minutes) response to traumatic injury and demonstrates mitoprotection as a promising therapeutic strategy for injury-induced cartilage damage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Despite sufficient knowledge about the prevention of oral health diseases, putting it into practice does not seem obvious, particularly not in a target group of frail older people. Inequality of health, partly increased by society becoming more multicultural and the ageing of the population, must be tackled. Diversity in the provision of care tailored to the care needs of different target groups is necessary. Another challenge lies in removing the barriers that (oral) healthcare providers experience when offering oral healthcare to frail older people. In order to provide a solution to the issues mentioned above, reorientation of oral healthcare services is needed. A more prevention-orientated approach to care, with methods of financing that support this, should be the goal. In addition, health literacy must be improved through health education and promotion. A model has been developed for interprofessional collaboration to optimise (oral) healthcare. This approach would lead to an increase in patient-centred care and in this way takes important steps forwards towards a healthier society.</AbstractText>"}

Loss of cognitive abilities can hinder communication with the patients. Dementia and care-resistant behaviour demand a special patient-centred approach. In addition, frail older people are often dependent on carers or volunteers who actively participate in the conversation when the patient visits the dentist. This article addresses issues dentists should take into account in such cases. It also makes suggestions about how most effectively to direct communications with older patients and/or their companions.</AbstractText>"}

People age differently, after all. Some remain vital until very old age, while others become frail and disabled much earlier in life. Because of the indicated demographic trend, morbidity is expected to increase and with it, the number of older people needing care. 'Aging in place' has become a central phenomenon in healthcare policies. This means that older people should be empowered to lead a meaningful life in their own living environment as long as possible, even when they are frail and care dependent. Therefore, in the future, most care for older people will actually occur at home. This article aims to present a meaningful care model for the older people. Starting from the 'definition discussion' about frailty and a revaluation of the concept of' resilience, a basis will be provided for a sustainable, proactive and personalised elderly care, close to the living environment of older people, in which dentists and other oral health professionals play an important role as well.</AbstractText>"}

Many cultures are each inoculated with a few thousand cells, each sensitive to a selective marker that can be assayed phenotypically. These parallel cultures grow for many generations in the absence of the phenotypic marker. A subset of cultures is used to estimate the total number of cells at risk of mutations (i.e., the population size at the end of the growth period, or Nt). The remaining cultures are plated onto the selective agar. The distribution of observed resistant mutants among parallel cultures is then used to estimate the expected number of mutational events, m, using a mathematical model. Dividing m by Nt gives the estimate of the mutation rate per locus per generation. The assay has three critical aspects: the chosen phenotypic marker, the chosen volume of parallel cultures, and ensuring that the surface on the selective agar is completely dry before the incubation. The assay is relatively inexpensive and only needs standard laboratory equipment. It is also less laborious than alternative approaches, such as mutation accumulation and single-cell assays. The assay works on organisms that go through many generations rapidly and it depends on assumptions about the fitness effects of markers and cell death. However, recently developed tools and theoretical studies mean these issues can now be addressed analytically. The assay allows mutation rate estimation of different phenotypic markers in cells with different genotypes growing in isolation or in a community. By conducting multiple assays in parallel, assays can be used to study how an organism's environmental context affects spontaneous mutation rate, which is crucial for understanding antimicrobial resistance, carcinogenesis, aging, and evolution.</AbstractText>"}

Research on potential sex differences in this relationship is scarce. The aim was to investigate the prospective association between overall diet quality, as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2015 at age 60-64y and measures of walking speed seven years later, among men and women from the Insight46, a neuroscience sub-study of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development. Diet was assessed at age 60-64y using five-day food diaries, from which total HEI-2015 was calculated. At age 69-71y, walking speed was estimated during four 10-meter walks at self-selected pace, using inertial measurement units. Multivariable linear regression models with sex as modifier, controlling for age, follow-up, lifestyle, health, social variables and physical performance were used. The final sample was 164 women and 167 men (n=331). Women had higher HEI-2015 scores and slower walking speed than men. A 10 point increase in HEI-2015 was associated with faster walking speed seven years later among women (B: 0.024, 95% CI: 0.006, 0.043), but not men. The association remained significant in the multivariable model (B: 0.021, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.040). In women in late midlife higher diet quality is associated with faster walking speed. A healthy diet in late midlife is likely to contribute towards better age-related physical capability and sex differences are likely to affect this relationship.</AbstractText>"}

Diagnosis of AD may be challenging when it starts in adolescence or adulthood, and is further complicated as its manifestations are different from those generally seen in children. Accordingly, better definition of diagnostic criteria for adult onset AD is needed to avoid misdiagnosis and undertreatment in adult patients. To provide practical guidance for clinicians to reliably diagnose AD in adult patients, representatives from three Italian dermatology scientific societies [Italian Society of Dermatology and Venereology (SIDeMaST), Italian Association of Hospital Dermatologists (ADOI), Italian Society of Allergological, Occupational and Environmental Dermatology (SIDAPA)] carried out a joint consensus meeting to develop useful indications for improving diagnosis of moderate to severe AD in adult patients in routine clinical practice. The most representative criteria for morphological criteria, localization, clinical history, and differential diagnosis were identified by the experts. The most frequent clinical presentations are those on the flexural areas, hands, face/neck, and trunk, with itch and eczema as key manifestations. The diagnostic path defined herein can form a sort of 'check list' for physicians to adopt when evaluating patients with suspected AD, which can help in refining a diagnosis and refer the patient for specialist dermatological care. It is hoped that the practical guidance developed by the consensus group will help to improve outcomes, lower overall costs of care, and ameliorate the patient's quality of life, even though validation in a large cohort of patients is still needed.</AbstractText>"}

Current studies investigating EEG coherence and power for specific brain areas and frequency bands have yielded inconsistent results. This study assessed EEG coherence and power indices at rest measured over the whole skull and for a wide frequency range as global EEG markers for cognition in a sample at risk for dementia. Since global markers are more reliable and less error-prone than region- and frequency-specific indices they might help to overcome previous inconsistencies. Global EEG coherence (1-30 Hz) and an EEG slowing score were assessed. The EEG slowing score was calculated by low-frequency power (1-8 Hz) divided by high-frequency power (9-30 Hz). In addition, the prognostic value of the two EEG indices for cognition and cognitive decline was assessed in a 5-year follow-up pilot study. Baseline global coherence correlated positively with cognition at baseline, but not with cognitive decline or with cognition at the 5-year follow-up. The EEG slowing ratio showed no significant association, neither with cognition at baseline or follow-up, nor with cognitive decline over a period of 5 years. The results indicate that the resting state global EEG coherence might be a useful and easy to assess electrophysiological correlate for neurocognitive health in older adults at risk for dementia. Because of the small statistical power for the follow-up analyses, the prognostic value of global coherence could not be determined in the present study.

Circulating ANGPTL2 levels were log-transformed to correct for skewed distribution and analyzed as a continuous variable.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>Of 412 patients, 395 were included for statistical analysis. Time-to-event data analysis showed high circulating ANGPTL2 levels were associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, sex, hemodialysis vintage, nutritional status, metabolic parameters and circulating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels {hazard ratio [HR] 2.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-3.77]}. High circulating ANGPTL2 levels were also strongly associated with an increased mortality risk, particularly in patients with a relatively benign prognostic profile [HR 3.06 (95% CI 1.86-5.03)]. Furthermore, the relationship between circulating ANGPTL2 levels and mortality risk was particularly strong in patients showing few aging-related phenotypes, such as younger patients [HR 7.99 (95% CI 3.55-18.01)], patients with a short hemodialysis vintage [HR 3.99 (95% CI 2.85-5.58)] and nondiabetic patients [HR 5.15 (95% CI 3.19-8.32)].</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>We conclude that circulating ANGPTL2 levels are positively associated with mortality risk in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and that ANGPTL2 could be a unique marker for the progression of premature aging and subsequent mortality risk in uremic patients, except those with significant aging-related phenotypes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we combine genome-wide association studies with modeling of longitudinal growth traits to study the genetics of infant and child growth, followed by functional, pathway, genetic correlation, risk score, and colocalization analyses to determine how developmental timings, molecular pathways, and genetic determinants of these traits overlap with those of adult health. We found a robust overlap between the genetics of child and adult body mass index (BMI), with variants associated with adult BMI acting as early as 4 to 6 years old. However, we demonstrated a completely distinct genetic makeup for peak BMI during infancy, influenced by variation at the <i>LEPR/LEPROT</i> locus. These findings suggest that different genetic factors control infant and child BMI. In light of the obesity epidemic, these findings are important to inform the timing and targets of prevention strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AD is a complex multifactorial disease and failure of single target therapeutics targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) in recent clinical trials suggests that future AD drug development should be focused on simultaneous targeting of several pathological hallmarks of the disease. Recently, we have shown that GMP-1, a 2-(methoxymethyl)pyrimido [1, 2-a] benzimidazol-4-ol, protects mitochondrial function in drosophila and mice models of AD, and improved memory and behavior indicating neuroprotective effect of GMP-1 treatment. Here, we have found that GMP-1 specifically binds to copper and zinc, metals that are dysregulated in AD brain. Addition of GMP-1 does not inhibit metal-dependent enzymatic reactions. Also, binding of Zn(II) and Cu(II) by GMP-1 is weaker than the 8-hydroxyquinoline scaffold compound clioquinol previously tested in AD clinical trials. However, GMP-1 affects Cu(II)-dependent Aβ fibrillization as well as oxidative damage and viability of SH-SY5Y cells upon addition of Cu(II) and Aβ. Our data provide new insight on GMP-1 as a Zn(II) and Cu(II) specific metal chelator of moderate affinity that can be responsible for some of its neuroprotective effects observed in AD animal models.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, the likelihood of bacterial excision from yeast under aging and starvation stresses was assessed using 10 gastric and 10 food-borne yeasts. Yeasts were identified as members of Candida or Saccharomyces genus by amplification and sequencing of D1/D2 region of 26S rDNA. For aging stress, yeasts were cultured on brain heart infusion agar supplemented with sheep blood and incubated at 30 °C for 3-4 weeks. For starvation stress, yeasts were inoculated into distilled water and incubated similarly. After seven days, starved yeasts were cultured on yeast extract glucose agar, incubated similarly and examined daily for appearance of bacterial colonies on top of the yeast's growth. Outgrowth of excised bacteria was observed on top of the cultures of 4 yeasts (Y1, Y3, Y13 and Y18) after 3-7 days. The excised bacteria (B1, B3, B13 and B18) were isolated and identified at the genus level according to their biochemical characteristics as well as amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA. B1 (Arthrobacter) were excised from Y1 (Candida albicans) upon aging and B3 (Staphylococcus), B13 (Cellulomonas) and B18 (Staphylococcus) were excised from their respective yeasts; Y3 (Candida tropicalis), Y13 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Y18 (Candida glabrata) upon starvation. DNA from yeasts was used for detection of 16S rDNA of their intracellular bacteria and sequencing. Amplified products from yeasts showed sequence similarity to those of excised bacteria. Under normal conditions, yeast exerts tight control on multiplication of its intracellular bacteria. However, upon aging and starvation the control is no longer effective and bacterial outgrowth occurs. Unlimited multiplication of excised bacteria might provide yeast with plenty of food in close vicinity. This could be an evolutionary dialogue between yeast and bacteria that ensures the survival of both partners.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

A PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction model for elderly households in Hong Kong has been developed by combining ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations obtained from land use regression model and questionnaire-elicited information related to the indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> sources. The fitted linear mixed-effects model is moderately predictive for the observed indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.67 (or R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61 by cross-validation).

In this study, we describe the link between these two behaviors through a combination of electron microscopy and aggregation kinetics. We find that two different proteins become soluble under harsh conditions through oligomerization with DNA. These DNA/protein oligomers form 'networks,' which increase the speed of oligomerization. The cases of DNA both increasing and preventing protein aggregation are observed to stem from this enhanced oligomerization. This observation raises interesting questions about the role of nucleic acids in aggregate formation in disease states.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

In aged Ts65Dn animals, both Calbindin+ and ChAT+ neurons were decreased compared to euploid controls. Additionally, in the dorsal corticospinal white matter tract, there were significantly fewer CC1+ mature OLs in 30- and 60-day old trisomic animals and this normalized to euploid levels at 10-11 months. In contrast, the mature OL population was increased in the lateral funiculus, an ascending white matter tract carrying sensory information.

Studies generally attempt to control for standing speed differences by asking participants to stand in a specified time but little is known about the range of transition times observed. This study aimed to characterize how standing speed associates with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular measures following transition from supine to standing. Continuous cerebral oxygenation, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were monitored for 3 minutes after transitioning from supine to standing. An algorithm was used to calculate the time taken to transition from existing Finometer data (from the height correction unit). Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the influence of transition time on each of the signals while adjusting for covariates. Transition time ranged from 2 to 27 s with 17% of participants taking &gt;10 s to stand. Faster transition was associated with a more extreme decrease 10 s after standing but improved recovery at 20 s for cerebral oxygenation and blood pressure. Standing faster was associated with an elevated heart rate on initiation of stand and a quicker recovery 10 to 20 s after standing. The speed of transitioning from supine to standing position is associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular response in the early period after standing (&lt;40 s). Care should be taken in the interpretation of findings which may be confounded by standing speed and statistical adjustment for standing time should be applied where appropriate.</AbstractText>"}

Although it has been postulated that autoregulatory efficiency is attenuated in the aging kidney, direct evidence remains lacking. In the present study, we measured the autoregulation of renal blood flow, myogenic response of afferent arteriole (Af-Art), tubuloglomerular feedback in vivo with micropuncture, as well as tubuloglomerular feedback in vitro in isolated perfused juxtaglomerular apparatus in young and aged C57BL/6 mice. We found that renal blood flow was not significantly changed in response to a defined elevation of renal arterial pressure in young mice but significantly increased in aged mice. Additionally, myogenic response of Af-Art measured by microperfusion with a stepwise increase in perfusion pressure was significantly blunted in the aging kidney, which is associated with the attenuation of intraluminal pressure-induced intracellular calcium increases, as well as the reduced expression of integrin α5 (Itga5) in Af-Art. Moreover, both tubuloglomerular feedback in vivo and in vitro were nearly inactive in the aging kidney, which is associated with the significantly reduced expression of adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) and suppressed vasoconstrictor response to adenosine in Af-Art. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that aging impairs renal autoregulation with blunted myogenic response and inhibited tubuloglomerular feedback response. The underlying mechanisms involve the downregulations of integrin α5 and A1AR in the Af-Art.</AbstractText>"}

Targeting aging itself might, therefore, be a better strategy than targeting each chronic disease individually for enhancing human health. Although much should be achieved for completely understanding the biological basis of aging, cellular senescence is now believed to mainly contribute to organismal aging via two independent, yet not mutually exclusive mechanisms: on the one hand, senescence of stem cells leads to exhaustion of stem cells and thus decreases tissue regeneration. On the other hand, senescent cells secrete many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, collectively termed as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which causes chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. Much effort has been recently made to therapeutically target detrimental effects of cellular senescence including selectively eliminating senescent cells (senolytics) and modulating a proinflammatory senescent secretome (senostatics). Here, we discuss current progress and limitations in understanding molecular mechanisms of senolytics and senostatics and therapeutic strategies for applying them. Furthermore, we propose how these novel interventions for aging treatment could be improved, based on lessons learned from cancer treatment.</AbstractText>"}

RGCs are a heterogenous class of retinal neurons which can be classified into multiple types based on morphological, functional and genetic characteristics. This review examines the body of evidence supporting type-specific vulnerability of RGCs in glaucoma and explores potential mechanisms by which this might come about. Studies of donor tissue from glaucoma patients have generally noted greater vulnerability of larger RGC types. Models of glaucoma induced in primates, cats and mice also show selective effects on RGC types - particularly OFF RGCs. Several mechanisms may contribute to type-specific vulnerability, including differences in the expression of calcium-permeable receptors (for example pannexin-1, P2X7, AMPA and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptors), the relative proximity of RGCs and their dendrites to blood supply in the inner plexiform layer, as well as differing metabolic requirements of RGC types. Such differences may make certain RGCs more sensitive to intraocular pressure elevation and its associated biomechanical and vascular stress. A greater understanding of selective RGC vulnerability and its underlying causes will likely reveal a rich area of investigation for potential treatment targets.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Optometry Australia.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here, endogenous ethylene production and the expression of genes in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling pathway were investigated to explore the crosstalk between H<sub>2</sub> and ethylene during the senescence of cut roses. Our results revealed that addition of exogenous ethylene by ethephon accelerated the senescence of cut roses, in which 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup> ethephon displayed the most obvious senescent phenotype. While the applied different concentrations (1%, 10%, 50% and 100%) of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) conducted different affects in alleviating the senescence of cut roses, and 1% HRW displayed the best ornamental quality and the longest vase life by reducing ethylene production, supported by the decrease of 1-aminocyclopropene-1-carboxylate (ACC) accumulation, ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) activities, and Rh-ACS3 and Rh-ACO1 expressions in ethylene biosynthesis. In addition, HRW increased the transcripts of ethylene receptor genes Rh-ETR1 at blooming period from day 4 to day 6 and suppressed Rh-ETR3 at senescence phase at day 8 after harvest. Furthermore, the relevant affection of HRW on Rh-ETR1 and Rh-ETR3 expressions still existed when the ethylene production was compromised by adequate addition of exogenous ethylene in HRW-treated cut rose petals, and HRW directly repressed the protein level of Rh-ETR3 in a transient expression assay.

Here, we examined the link between WM microstructure and psychopathology during adolescence. Twenty youth diagnosed with affective, attentional, and behavioral disorders (clinical sample), and 20 age-matched controls were recruited to examine group differences in WM microstructure, attentional control, and the link between them. The main results showed that clinical sample had relatively lower attentional control and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM throughout the brain: two association tracts were identified, and many differences were found in areas rich in callosal and projection fibers. Moreover, increased FA was positively associated with attention performance in the clinical sample in structures supporting ventral WM pathways, whereas a similar link was identified in controls in dorsal WM association fibers. Overall, these results support a model of general impairment in WM microstructure combined with reliance on altered, perhaps less efficient, pathways for attentional control in youth with affective, attentional, and behavioral disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Here we describe a method, called Biopsy using Electrostimulation for Enhanced NMJSampling (BeeNMJs) that improves the outcome of muscle biopsies. We used local cutaneous stimulation to identify the area enriched with NMJs for each participant at the right Vastus lateralis (VL). The needle biopsy was then performed in proximity of that point. The BeeNMJs procedure was safe for the participants. We observed NMJs in 53.3% of biopsies in comparison with only 16.7% using the traditional method. Furthermore, we observed an average of 30.13 NMJs per sample compared to only 2.33 for the traditional method. Importantly, high quality neuromuscular material was obtained whereby pre-, postsynaptic and glial elements were routinely labeled, simultaneously with myosin heavy chain type I. The BeeNMJs approach will facilitate studies of NMJs, particularly in human disease or aging process.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Interestingly, placing senescent cells into a young ECM rejuvenates them. Furthermore, we found that many longevity-assurances pathways reactivate de novo synthesis of ECM proteins during aging. This raises the question of what constitutes a young ECM to reverse aging or maintain health? In order to make inroads to answering this question, I suggest a systems-level approach of quantifying the matrisome or ECM compositions reflecting health, pathology, or phenotype and propose a novel term, the 'matreotype,' to describe this. The matreotype is defined as the composition and modification of ECM or matrisome proteins associated with or caused by a phenotype, such as longevity, or a distinct and acute physiological state, as observed during aging or disease. Every cell type produces its unique ECM. Intriguingly, cancer-cell types can even be identified based on their unique ECM composition. Thus, the matreotype reflects cellular identity and physiological status. Defined matreotypes could be used as biomarkers or prognostic factors for disease or health status during aging with potential relevance for personalized medicine. Treatment with biologics that alter ECM-to-cell mechanotransduction might be a strategy to reverse age-associated pathologies. An understanding of how to reverse from an old to a young matreotype might point toward novel strategies to rejuvenate cells and help maintain tissue homeostasis to promote health during aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 S.

Air pollution is a complex mixture of particles, vapors and gases emitted from natural and anthropogenic sources as well as formed through photochemical transformation processes. In metropolitan areas, air pollutants from combustion emissions feature a blend of emitted particles, oxides of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and secondary reaction products, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and secondary organic aerosols. Because many of the primary and transformed pollutants track together, their relative contributions to health outcomes are difficult to disentangle. Aside from the criteria pollutants ozone and nitrogen dioxide and some of the simpler aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde and acrolein), other products from photochemical processes are a particularly vexing class of chemicals to investigate since they comprise a dynamic ill-defined complex mixture in both particulate and gas phases. The purpose of this review was to describe and compare health effects of freshly emitted versus oxidatively or photochemically aged air pollutants. In some cases, (e.g. single volatile organic compounds) photochemical transformation resulted in marked enhancements in toxicity through formation of both known and unidentified reaction products, while in other examples (e.g. aging of automobile emissions) the potentiation of effect was variable. The variation in experimental design, aging system employed, concentration and type of starting agent, and toxicity endpoints make comparisons between different studies exceedingly difficult. A more systematic approach with a greater emphasis on higher throughput screening and computational toxicology is needed to fully answer under what conditions oxidatively- or photochemically-transformed pollutants elicit greater health effects than primary emissions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier B.V.</CopyrightInformation>"}

A potentially important yet unaddressed strategy to enhance walking ability through exercise intervention is to add a timing and coordination component in gait training (i.e. task specific timing and coordination exercise intervention) to the usual strength, endurance, and flexibility training. We describe the methods and rationale of a randomized single-blind, physical therapist supervised, exercise intervention trial to compare the effects of a standard strength, endurance, and flexibility program to a standard plus timing and coordination program in community-dwelling older adults walking slower than the desired gait speed of 1.2 m/s. Exercise sessions are twice weekly for 12 weeks. Participants are assessed at baseline, 12 weeks (post intervention), 24 weeks and 36 weeks. The primary outcome is gait speed, secondary outcomes represent components of the interventions (strength, endurance, flexibility, timing and coordination), and tertiary outcomes are measure of activity and participation (Late Life Function and Disability Instrument and physical activity). The findings of this trial will (1) establish if a standard-plus task specific timing and coordination program is superior to a standard strength and endurance program in improving mobility, activity and participation and (2) determine if the improvements are sustained over time. The information derived from this project will provide valuable insight into the prevention and management of walking difficulty, which is so common in older Americans.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is known that the chronic inflammatory condition generates counteracting immunosuppressive state in many diseases. Inflammaging is also associated with an immune deficiency; generally termed as immunosenescence, although it is not known whether it represents the senescence of immune cells or the active remodeling of immune system. Evidence has accumulated since the 1970's indicating that immunosenescence might be caused by an increased activity of immunosuppressive cells rather than cellular senescence. Immune cells display remarkable plasticity; many of these cells can express both proinflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotypes in a context-dependent manner. The immunosuppressive network involves the regulatory subtypes of T (Treg) and B (Breg) cells as well as regulatory phenotypes of macrophages (Mreg), dendritic (DCreg), natural killer (NKreg), and type II natural killer T (NKT) cells. The immunosuppressive network also includes monocytic (M-MDSC) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSC) myeloid-derived suppressor cells which are immature myeloid cells induced by inflammatory mediators. This co-operative network is stimulated in chronic inflammatory conditions preventing excessive inflammatory responses but at the same time they exert harmful effects on the immune system and tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed that the aging process is associated with the activation of immunosuppressive network, especially the functions of MDSCs, Tregs, and Mregs are increased. I will briefly review the properties of the regulatory phenotypes of immune cells and examine in detail the evidences for an activation of immunosuppressive network with aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This process has been most clearly described in blood and bone marrow, esophagus, colon, and skin, but cumulative DNA damage likely affects all tissues of the body. Although most acquired genetic variants have no discernable functional consequences, some randomly occurring somatic mutations confer a relative fitness advantage on a single stem cell and its progeny compared with surrounding cells, which may lead to progressive expansion of a clone (i.e., a genetically identical group of cells). When these mutations occur in a cell with the capacity to self-renew and expand, the mutations persist, and such clonal expansion is a risk factor for further mutation acquisition and clonal evolution. Hematopoietic stem cells are a special case of clonal expansion because both the stem cells and their blood cell progeny circulate in large numbers, and these cells are not subject to some of the anatomical restrictions that characterize other tissues in which somatic mutations conferring a fitness advantage also occur. Therefore, clonally restricted hematopoiesis can have biological and clinical consequences that are distinct from clonal expansions in other tissues. Such consequences include not only clonal progression to overt myeloid neoplasia (or, less commonly, to lymphoid neoplasia) driven by acquisition of secondary mutations in the cells of the expanded clone, but also cardiovascular events and, most likely, other diseases that are influenced by aberrant function of mutant blood cells. A more detailed understanding of how clonal hematopoiesis arises and how clonal selection and expansion occur, as well as development of strategies to avert the clinical consequences associated with clonal hematopoiesis, may both improve public health and yield more general insights into the biology of aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

We aimed to investigate the effect of GPA treatment on cognitive performance, Aβ deposition and glial cells activation in the transgenic mouse model of AD. 6-7 months APP/PS1 mice were given GPA for 90 days; behavioral experiments were executed to estimate the memory and spatial learning abilities of mice, and the mechanism of neuroprotective effect of GPA was investigated with a focus on amyloid-β deposition, astrocytes and microglia activation and neuroinflammation. GPA treatment significantly improved the spatial learning and memory abilities and also decreased cerebral amyloid-β deposition in APP/PS1 mice. Via HE staining, we found that GPA could ameliorate histopathological changes in cerebrum. We also found that GPA treatment inhibited the activation of astrocytes and microglia, down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS, and up-regulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Arg-1. In addition, GPA down-regulated the gene expression of HMGB-1 receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE) then mediated MyD88, TRAF6 and phospho-ERK1/2, subsequently modulated the expression of key AP-1 and NF-κB family members (c-Fos, c-Jun and p65).

Soluble factors produced by engrafted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mediate potential therapeutic effects in AD. However, these therapeutic benefits are largely hampered by the limited paracrine capacity of MSCs. In this study, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transduction of bone marrow MSCs to deliver exogenous proteins into the brain of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice in the early stage of impairment. We observed that engrafted MSCs carrying exogenous (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) alone reduced the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-ɑ and improved synapse-related protein expression but not cognitive function. Transplantation of MSCs carrying CX3CL1 and Wnt3a (CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC) significantly attenuated the learning and memory impairment when compared with a control group. The improvement of neurobehavioral functions in APP/PS1 mice treated with CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC was related to the inhibition of microglial neurotoxicity and promotion of hippocampal neurogenesis. Transplantation of CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC also regulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/activated protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling to inhibit the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β).

The HGF_85% of accumulation mode particles were observed to increase from the minimum value observed during the morning until its maximum afternoon value. This study reported two maximum (early morning and afternoon time) and two minimum values (morning and evening time) of HGF_85%s. As a consequence, the main reasons for this incremental behavior were, increase in the ratio of inorganic to OA and oxidation level, f44 (m/z44/OA) of the OA within the particle phase. In context to the effect of ambient RH, this study reported two distinct variations of mean HGF_85% as the function of ambient RH. The positive linear relationship at low RH (LRH, RH ≤ 50%) was clearly associated with low OA loading, relatively higher substantial temperature, and wind speed.

The 2 divergent GG were (1) high EBI; representative of the top 5% nationally (elite), and (2) EBI representative of the national average (NA). In each year, 90 elite and 45 NA cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 FT: control, lower grass allowance, and high concentrate. No interaction between GG and FT was observed for any of the measures of fertility investigated. The elite cows achieved significantly greater pregnancy rate to first service (+14.9 percentage points), and significantly greater pregnancy rates after 21, 42, and 84 d of breeding (+17.3, +15.2, and +9.6 percentage points, respectively) compared with NA. The number of services per cow was fewer for elite (1.57) compared with NA (1.80). The interval from mating start date to pregnancy was significantly shorter for elite cows compared with NA. The elite cows maintained greater mean body condition score than NA throughout the study (2.91 vs. 2.72), and had greater body condition score at calving, artificial insemination, and drying off compared with NA. The elite cows had greater mean circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 compared with NA. No significant effect was observed of GG on commencement of luteal activity, or progesterone profile variables. Greater survival to the start of fifth lactation was observed for elite cows. The elite cows were 43% less likely to be culled than NA by the beginning of the fifth lactation.

Housed dairy cattle demonstrate a variety of negative behavioral and physiological effects when lying time is restricted, with cows prioritizing the recovery of rest over feeding when both are deprived. There is, however, wide individual-cow variation in daily lying times, influenced by an array of cow-, housing-, and management-related factors. Cow-related factors include individual preference, parity, stage of lactation cycle, milk yield, ill health, and lameness. Lying time tends to increase with age and days in milk and during periods of ill health, whereas milk yield is negatively correlated with lying time. The effect of lameness is complicated by severity and by interactions with bedding type, which modifies the cows' ability to rise and lie down. Generally, lame cows suffer prolonged lying bouts of greater variability in length and take fewer bouts per day. Often this results in an overall increase in lying time. Thus, higher standards of cow comfort and improved cow health are not always reflected by longer lying times. Housing and management factors that influence resting behavior include the design of the resting area, access to the resting space, and the thermal microenvironment of the lying area. Provision of dry, deep loose bedding, stocking cows to allow each animal access to a resting space, allowing sufficient time to access the resting area, and providing heat abatement to reduce heat load optimize resting behavior. Because lameness and poor body condition are commonly found in culled dairy cattle, the link between cow comfort and culling is likely mediated through lameness onset and management. Optimal comfort helps prevent the onset of lameness and facilitates recovery once cows become lame, which limits the effect of lameness on feeding behavior and reduces the risk for other health-related disorders, poor reproductive performance, and early herd removal. Cow comfort cannot be assessed by measuring the duration of lying time alone. Rather, comfort is reflected by the optimization of resting behavior, providing facilities and management to allow cows to lie down when they choose to do so for as long as they need to.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Aging of oocytes results in reduced embryo developmental capacity and blastocyst quality, which is thought to be caused partly by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aimed to determine the effect of l-carnitine (LC) on the development of embryos formed from aged oocytes in vitro. The development and quality of the blastocysts in the LC-treated group were significantly higher than those in the untreated aged group after in vitro fertilization (IVF). In addition, after LC treatment, the level of intracellular ROS in aged group significantly decreased, and glutathione (GSH) levels significantly increased compared with those in the untreated aged group. There was no significant difference in the mitochondrial membrane potential among the three groups. Moreover, ROS could induce autophagy and LC3 antibody was widely used as a marker for detecting autophagy. The fluorescence intensity of LC3 in the aged group was significantly higher than that of LC3 in the LC-treated group. Furthermore, Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that the mRNA levels of antioxidation genes GPX4 and SOD1 were significantly higher in embryos from LC-treated group than in those from the untreated aged group. In summary, our results indicated that LC can improve the developmental capacity of embryos from aging oocytes in vitro by reducing oxidative stress.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Stigmatic papilla cells form an indispensable organ for plant reproduction. The lifetime of papilla cells is tightly controlled, and the developmental PCD (dPCD) process is involved in papilla cell death. Hence, papilla cell death is a good model for studying on PCD process. In this study, the dPCD signal was visualized in dying papilla cells by detecting the GUS signal of the PCD-related reporter gene BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE 1 (BFN1). We found that the GUS was not expressed at young stage, but strongly expressed in papilla cells at the ageing stage, indicating the PCD process was triggered to terminate the papilla cell fate. Given this, the RNA-Seq data set, which covered the information of the whole lifespan of papilla cells, was analyzed aiming to understand which genes and pathways were involved in papilla cell death. 37 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were isolated. Moreover, the pathways related to energy production and transportation, autophagy, and plant hormone signal transduction were considered as the key pathways involved in the papilla cell death. 9 types, total of 104 transcriptional factors (TFs) were identified as well. Finally, a putative working model of papilla cell death was integrated. The findings herein will enrich the knowledge of the dPCD-mediated pathway in regulating plant organ/tissue growth, development, senescence, and death. Our study will provide some referential gene resources for studying on the dPCD in other plant organs or tissues.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Vascular degenerative disorders of posterior eye are the vision threatening disorders, involving inflammation as one of the main pathological mechanisms. Use of current treatment regimens for PSED is significantly limited on account of unique environment of the eye that offers a major barrier to the delivery of efficient drug doses to the posterior segment. Sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, acts by inhibiting the T-cell proliferation and the release of inflammatory cytokines, have been widely investigated for its potential role in the treatment of PSED. Clinical application of the sirolimus, however, has been limited due to its poor physico-chemical properties like poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailable, high molecular weight and high instability. Although nanocarriers like liposomes have shown a great promise in shuttling the cargo to the target site for various applications, yet, due to distinct anatomical and physiological barriers of the eye, these conventional liposomes are inefficient to shuttle the cargo to the posterior segment. Therefore, in this hypothesis, we propose to incorporate edge activators (polyol) in the liposomal bilayer thereby to enhance the liposomal fluidity and deformability. Such polyol modified liposomes would successfully penetrate the blood retinal barrier and would efficiently shuttle the sirolimus to the posterior segment of the eye making this a promising strategy for the treatment of PSED.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated how patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) apply information in an intertemporal choice task between smaller intermediate and larger delayed rewards, with minimal memory demands. Multilevel modeling estimated subject-level sensitivities to three attributes of choice (the relative difference in reward magnitude, delay length, and absolute reward magnitudes) as well as baseline impulsivity. While baseline impulsivity in patients with Alzheimer's disease did not differ from controls, patients with bvFTD and svPPA were more impulsive than controls overall. Patients with Alzheimer's disease or bvFTD were less sensitive than controls to all three choice attributes, whereas patients with svPPA were less sensitive than controls to two attributes. Attenuated sensitivity to information presented during the choice was associated across all subjects with dorsomedial prefrontal atrophy for all three choice attributes. Given the minimal memory demands of our task, these findings suggest specific mechanisms underlying decision-making failures beyond episodic and working memory deficits in dementia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therapies targeting extracellular, pathogenic α-synuclein may therefore hold promise for slowing or halting disease progression. In this regard, it has been suggested that highly-selective antibodies can be administered as therapeutic agents targeting pathogenic proteins. In the current study, we screened a series of antibodies using multiple selection criterion to identify those that selectively bind pathogenic α-synuclein and show potent inhibition of pathology seeding in a neuronal model of α-synucleinopathy.

In this work, the feasibility of coaxial electrospraying (CES) was investigated to manufacture in one single step, a powder of individually coated particles containing atenolol (ATE), lovastatin (LOV) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). To improve the dissolution rate of the poorly water soluble LOV, an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) of LOV with Soluplus® (SOL) was formulated and Eudragit S100®, an enteric copolymer that only dissolves above pH 7, was applied as coating to avoid LOV hydrolysis in acidic medium. Furthermore, ATE was added to the inner ASD compartment and the acidic ASA was embedded in the coating layer. With regard to the uncoated ASD particles, which were prepared with single nozzle electrospraying, the rate and extent of the LOV dissolution was increased, even to an extent of 100 % for the 1/1/6 (ATE/LOV/SOL) ratio. Hence, this ratio was selected and coated particles with proper release of the three APIs could be successfully produced via CES. However, a peculiar behaviour of the coating performance was observed. Regarding LOV, the enteric layer of the particles performed as expected in acidic medium and supersaturation was obtained after the switch to a neutral pH, but in contrast, over 50 % of ATE was released after 90 min in acidic medium. Nonetheless, hardly any ATE was released under acidic circumstances from ATE tablets that were, as a benchmark, manually dip-coated with Eudragit S100®. Two different model APIs, namely paracetamol (well soluble) and fenofibrate (poorly soluble) were tested as well, revealing similar discrepancy in the coating performance. The coating layer formed during CES is most likely less dense as compared to the layer produced with tablet coating and consequently, more permeable for highly soluble APIs, but not for the poorly soluble compounds.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

We used two validated mouse frailty assessment tools: phenotypic frailty score (FS) and clinical frailty index (FI) to investigate age- and sex- related differences in frailty status in 5xFAD mice.

Butein has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-cancer effects. However, few studies have been done to evaluate whether butein exerts protective effects on neurons, and the potential mechanism for this effect has not been studied. Here, we examined the effect of butein on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells grown with conditioned medium from BV2 microglia cells that had been activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a neuroinflammation model. We found butein pretreatment significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting the apoptosis normally induced by microglia-conditioned medium. SH-SY5Y cells treated with microglia-conditioned medium showed upregulated ERK signaling pathway-related mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation, which was dose-dependently reversed by butein. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot results showed that BV2-LPS conditioned medium-induced Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) transactivational activity in SH-SY5Y cells, but this was attenuated by butein treatment of the BV2 cells prior to their exposure to LPS. Collectively, our results indicate that butein effectively mitigates inflammatory injury caused by LPS-conditioned medium from microglia, possibly due to reductions in the transactivational activity of NF-κB p65 and ERK signaling pathway activation, and provide evidence for a neuroprotective role of butein through blocking negative consequences of microglial activation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, using the 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing methods, we characterized the microbial phenotypes of 16 female cynomolgus macaques from three age groups (young, adult and old). Our findings revealed significant differences in microbial composition among the three groups. With increased age, the relative abundances of <i>Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Succinivibrionaceae</i> were significantly increased, <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> and <i>Rikenellaceae</i> were significantly decreased at the family level. Functional enrichment showed that genes that differed among the three groups were mainly involved in arginine biosynthesis, purine metabolism and microbial polysaccharides metabolism. Moreover, CAZymes corresponding to polysaccharide degrading activities were also observed among the three groups.

For example, senescence-associated T cells are an age-dependent CD4(<sup>+</sup> ) T-cell subpopulation with a PD-1(<sup>+</sup> ) memory phenotype; these cells do not proliferate in response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and produce abundant osteopontin, as well as inflammatory cytokines. Senescence-associated T cells are also increased in adipose tissue under a high-fat diet, which might be related to the progress of obesity or diabetes. These series of findings might allow us to connect senescent cells and tissue aging, leading to individual aging. Interestingly, the depletion of senescent cells in the body, called senolysis, successfully increases lifespan and attenuates age-related diseases. This novel therapy is now moving forward to translational research from the bench toward clinical trials.

This causes an increased rate of ovarian reserve depletion in Amh-/- mice. The depletion of the ovarian reserve is responsible for the onset of menopause but age-related infertility occurs in advance of ovarian reserve depletion. To determine whether accelerated loss of primordial follicles leads to earlier onset infertility, Amh-/- and Amh+/+ females were paired with Amh+/+ stud males and birth rates were recorded across the females' reproductive lifespan. The number of primordial follicles remaining in the ovaries of Amh-/- and Amh+/+ females were quantified in 2 cohorts at 11-12 and 12-13 months of age. As expected, the ovarian reserve in the Amh-/- females became depleted approximately 1 month earlier than Amh+/+ females. However, no difference was observed in the cumulative number of births over the lifespan, nor were there any differences in mean littersize at any age. It is possible that the reproductive lifespan of mice is too short for sufficient divergence of primordial follicles numbers to cause differences in Amh-/- and Amh+/+ female fertility. An alternative explanation contradicts current thinking; the function of AMH may be unrelated to the longevity of the reproductive lifespan in female mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Cisd2 deficiency causes accelerated aging and shortened lifespan, while persistent expression of Cisd2 promotes longevity in mice. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of senile dementia and is without an effective therapeutic strategy. We investigated whether Cisd2 upregulation is able to ameliorate β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and prevent neuronal loss using an AD mouse model. Our study makes three major discoveries. First, using the AD mouse model (APP/PS1 double transgenic mice), the dosage of Cisd2 appears to modulate the severity of AD phenotypes. Cisd2 overexpression (~2-fold) significantly promoted survival and alleviated the pathological defects associated with AD. Conversely, Cisd2 deficiency accelerated AD pathogenesis. Secondly, Cisd2 overexpression protected against Aβ-mediated mitochondrial damage and attenuated loss of neurons and neuronal progenitor cells. Finally, an increase in Cisd2 shifted the expression profiles of a panel of genes that are dysregulated by AD towards the patterns observed in wild-type mice. These findings highlight Cisd2-based therapies as a potential disease-modifying strategy for AD. This article is protected by copyright.

Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by multiple factors including aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, and/or stressors. In PD, a substantial loss of substantia nigra (SN) neurons leads to rigid tremors, bradykinesia, and chronic fatigue. Several studies have reported that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is altered in PD patients, leading to an increase level of cortisol which contributes to neurodegeneration and oxidative stress. We hypothesized that chronic psychological distress induces PD-like symptoms and promotes neurodegeneration in wild-type (WT) rats and exacerbates PD pathology in PINK1 knockout (KO) rats, a well-validated animal model of PD. We measured the bioenergetics profile (oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis) in the brain by employing an XF24<sup>e</sup> Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer in young rats subjected to predator-induced psychological distress. In addition, we analyzed anxiety-like behavior, motor function, expression of antioxidant enzymes, mitochondrial content, and neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. Overall, we observed that psychological distress diminished up to 50% of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) derived from both WT and PINK1-KO rats. Mechanistically, the level of antioxidant proteins, mitochondrial content, and BDNF was significantly altered. Finally, psychological distress robustly induced anxiety and Parkinsonian symptoms in WT rats and accelerated certain symptoms of PD in PINK1-KO rats. For the first time, our collective data suggest that psychological distress can phenocopy several aspects of PD neuropathology, disrupt brain energy production, as well as induce ataxia-like behavior.</AbstractText>"}

Cancer","Date":"Dec 13 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Most cancers arise in individuals over the age of 60. As the world population is living longer and reaching older ages, cancer is becoming a substantial public health problem. It is estimated that, by 2050, more than 20% of the world's population will be over the age of 60 - the economic, healthcare and financial burdens this may place on society are far from trivial. In this Review, we address the role of the ageing microenvironment in the promotion of tumour progression. Specifically, we discuss the cellular and molecular changes in non-cancerous cells during ageing, and how these may contribute towards a tumour permissive microenvironment; these changes encompass biophysical alterations in the extracellular matrix, changes in secreted factors and changes in the immune system. We also discuss the contribution of these changes to responses to cancer therapy as ageing predicts outcomes of therapy, including survival. Yet, in preclinical studies, the contribution of the aged microenvironment to therapy response is largely ignored, with most studies designed in 8-week-old mice rather than older mice that reflect an age appropriate to the disease being modelled. This may explain, in part, the failure of many successful preclinical therapies upon their translation to the clinic. Overall, the intention of this Review is to provide an overview of the interplay that occurs between ageing cell types in the microenvironment and cancer cells and how this is likely to impact tumour metastasis and therapy response.</AbstractText>"}

Bmal1 coordinates the rhythmic expression of transcriptome and regulates biological activities, involved in cell metabolism and aging. However, the role of Bmal1 in cellular- survival, signaling, its interaction with intracellular proteins, and how melatonin regulates its expression is largely unclear. Here we observed that melatonin increases the expression of Bmal1 and both melatonin and Bmal1 increase cellular survival after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) while the inhibition of Bmal1 resulted in the decreased cellular survival without affecting neuroprotective effects of melatonin. By using a planar surface immunoassay for PI3K/AKT signaling pathway components, we revealed that both melatonin and Bmal1 increased phosphorylation of AKT, ERK-1/2, PDK1, mTOR, PTEN, GSK-3αβ, and p70S6K. In contrast, inhibition of Bmal1 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of these proteins, which the effect of melatonin on these signaling molecules was not affected by the absence of Bmal1. Besides, the inhibition of PI3K/AKT decreased Bmal1 expression and the effect of melatonin on Bmal1 after both OGD in vitro and focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. Our data demonstrate that melatonin controls the expression of Bmal1 via PI3K/AKT signaling, and Bmal1 plays critical roles in cellular survival via activation of survival kinases.</AbstractText>"}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of microvascular disease in the memory centers of the brain are poorly understood. This pilot study investigated the nutrigenomic pathways by which the WD regulates gene expression in hippocampal brain microvessels of female mice. Five-week-old female low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDL-R-/-) and C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice were fed a chow or WD for 8 weeks. Metabolics for lipids, glucose and insulin were determined. Differential gene expression, gene networks and pathways, transcription factors, and non-protein coding RNAs were evaluated by genome-wide microarray and bioinformatics analysis of laser captured hippocampal microvessels. The WD resulted in differential expression of 2,412 genes. The majority of differential gene expression was attributable to differential regulation of cell signaling proteins and their transcription factors, approximately 7% was attributable to differential expression of miRNAs, and a lesser proportion was due to other non-protein coding RNAs, primarily long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) not previously described to be modified by the WD in females. Our findings revealed that chronic consumption of the WD resulted in integrated multilevel molecular regulation of the hippocampal microvasculature of female mice and may provide one of the mechanisms underlying vascular dementia.</AbstractText>"}

Eradicating all melanoma cells even in drug-sensitive tumors is unsuccessful in patients because a subset of cells can transition to a slow-cycling state, rendering them resistant to most targeted therapy. It is still unclear what pathways define these subpopulations and promote this resistant phenotype. In the current study, we show that Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that drives a metastatic, therapy-resistant phenotype, stabilizes the half-life of p53 and uses p53 to initiate a slow-cycling state following stress (DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging). Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow-cycling phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibition. In vivo, this can be accomplished with a single dose of p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating wild-type p53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The shortest male population averages ∼150 cm and the tallest ∼183 cm. Nonetheless the dimensions of head and trunk are highly comparable, with the vast difference in the leg length. Stunting is a personal condition in which an individual has a standing height-for-age (HAZ) of less than two standard deviations of the standard curve median. It is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and functional deficits. The process of losing relative stature is known as linear growth retardation, first attributed to chronic protein deficiency, then to an assortment of micronutrient deficiencies, and most recently to inflammation from unhygienic environmental conditions. Public health intervention trials responding to each of these possibilities have failed to produce true reversal responses measured in the 10s of centimeters. As to biological insights, there is no convenient way to separate weight from length growth with sonographic monitoring, but a third of infants can be born stunted. Normative growth (standard curves) competes with epigenetic adaptation (programming) as the beacon for in utero growth. Major investments into field trials allow us to discard multiple micronutrients and water/sanitation/hygiene interventions as measures to reverse established stunting. The preponderance of evidence is against catch-up growth during puberty. Future publications will be in the conceptual domain, resolving metrics, while the full range of stimuli and exposures impeding growth will be elucidated.

However, there is a lack of information about the impact of vegetarianism during pregnancy on subsequent cognitive function in children. The aim of this study was to investigate whether vegetarianism during pregnancy is associated with altered maternal nutritional status and with cognitive function in children at six to seven years of age. Women aged 20-34 years participating in a prospective observational study who provided dietary data and blood samples in early pregnancy (11 weeks; 78 vegetarians and 2144 omnivores) or late pregnancy (34 weeks; 91 vegetarians and 2552 omnivores). Compared with omnivorous women, vegetarian women had lower blood concentrations of arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and cobalamin in early and late pregnancy. Vegetarianism in pregnancy was linked to higher maternal educational attainment, longer breastfeeding duration, lower incidence of smoking during pregnancy and a tendency towards higher IQ in the mothers. Concentrations of some nutrients required for neurodevelopment were lower in maternal blood during gestation; however, after controlling for confounders consuming a vegetarian diet during pregnancy was not associated with poorer neurocognitive development of the children in this study.</AbstractText>"}

However, the covariation between personal perceptions of falls and factors and confidence of self-management in falls (CSMoF) is still under-studied despite its importance to fall prevention. We aimed to investigate the relative contribution of CSMoF in relation to fall risk self-perceptions while controlling for demographics and self-reported health and functioning. <b>Method:</b> Participants were 691 older adults recruited from Area Agency on Aging at Arlington, Texas (females = 76.1%, mean age = 76.23, <i>SD</i> = 6.44, with chronic condition = 79.5%). They completed measures of physical functioning, CSMoF, fall risk perceptions and fear of falls. <i>Results:</i> Regression analyses indicated that fear of fall was the most predictive factor of CSMoF among older persons, accounting for about 25% of the variance. Physical function measures of age, chronic illnesses of metabolism, sensory impairment, and health status were also significant predictors of the CSMoF, but to a lesser extent than fear of falls and fall perceptions. The interaction of perception of falls and fall experience attenuated CSMoF, with physical functioning limitations. <b>Conclusion:</b> The joint effects of perception of falls and fear of falls likely explain CSMoF among older adults more than physical functional indicators. Fall prevention programs for older adults should prioritize to address modifiable subjective factors of fall perceptions, fear of falls, and CSMoF across health and functioning statuses.</AbstractText>"}

The C-V<sub>2</sub>NO obtained at 700 °C had a low surface area (91.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), a moderate degree of graphitization, and a broader pore size distribution. The C-V<sub>2</sub>NO obtained at 800 °C displayed an interconnected network with higher surface area (121.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and a narrower pore size distribution. In contrast, at 900 °C, the C-V<sub>2</sub>NO displayed a disintegrated network and a decrease in the surface area (113 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). All the synthesized C-V<sub>2</sub>NO yielded mesoporous oxynitride nanostructures which were evaluated in three-electrode configuration using 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte as a function of temperature. The C-V<sub>2</sub>NO@800 °C electrode gave the highest electrochemical performance as compared to its counterparts due to its superior properties.

This study aimed to elucidate the effect of ET on aerobic capacity and platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics (MTB) in stroke patients. Among the 30 stroke patients who underwent the traditional rehabilitation program (TRP), 15 were randomly assigned to have ET (50-60% VO<sub>2peak</sub> for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks), and those remaining received only the TRP (control group). The peak exercise capacity (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) and platelet MTB, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the electron transport chain (ETC), were measured through automatic gas analysis and high-resolution respirometry, respectively. The results demonstrated that ET significantly increased the VO<sub>2peak</sub> (17.7%) and O<sub>2</sub> uptake efficiency slope (31.9%) but decreased the ventilation versus CO<sub>2</sub> production slope (-7.65%). Patients who underwent ET also had significantly enhanced platelet mitochondrial OXPHOS and ETC by activating the FADH2 (Complex II)-dependent pathway, but depressed plasma myeloperoxidase (-28.4%) and interleukin-6 levels (-29.9%). Moreover, changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub> levels were positively correlated with changes in platelet OXPHOS and ETC capacities. In conclusion, ET increases the platelet MTB by enhancing Complex II activity in stroke patients.

Selenium (Se) has been implicated in playing many important biological roles in male fertility and reproduction; however, its potential roles in female reproduction, particularly in aging subjects, remain poorly elucidated. Therefore, in the current study we used a murine model of female reproductive aging and elucidated how different Se-levels might affect the reproductive efficiency in aging females. Our results showed that at the end of an 8-week dietary trial, whole-blood Se concentration and blood total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) were significantly reduced in Se-deficient (0.08 mg Se/kg; Se-D) mice, whereas both of these biomarkers were significantly higher in inorganic (0.33 mg/kg; ISe-S) and organic (0.33 mg/kg; OSe-S) Se-supplemented groups. Similarly, compared to the Se-D group, Se supplementation significantly ameliorated the maintenance of follicles and reduced the rate of apoptosis in ovaries. Meanwhile, the rate of in vitro-produced embryos resulting from germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes was also significantly improved in Se-supplemented (ISe-S and OSe-S) groups compared to the Se-D mice, in which none of the embryos developed to the hatched blastocyst stage. RT-qPCR results revealed that mRNA expression of <i>Gpx1</i>, <i>Gpx3</i>, <i>Gpx4, Selenof</i>, <i>p21</i>, and <i>Bcl-2</i> genes in ovaries of aging mice was differentially modulated by dietary Se levels. A considerably higher mRNA expression of <i>Gpx1</i>, <i>Gpx3</i>, <i>Gpx4</i>, and <i>Selenof</i> was observed in Se-supplemented groups compared to the Se-D group. Similarly, mRNA expression of <i>Bcl-2</i> and <i>p21</i> was significantly lower in Se-supplemented groups. Immunohistochemical assay also revealed a significantly higher expression of GPX4 in Se-supplemented mice. Our results reasonably indicate that Se deficiency (or marginal levels) can negatively impact the fertility and reproduction in females, particularly those of an advancing age, and that the Se supplementation (inorganic and organic) can substantiate ovarian function and overall reproductive efficiency in aging females.</AbstractText>"}

The need of various kinds of eldercare is increasing tremendously. A senior daycare center, very similar to a daycare center for toddlers and preschoolers, can provide the elderly a place to go during daytime and have a more diversified social life. In this research, a senior daycare center location evaluation problem is studied, and a model for facilitating the decision-making of the senior daycare center location is constructed by considering the benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) of the locations. Senior daycare center location evaluation factors are listed first through literature review and interview with experts. These factors are used to construct a network, which is applied to prepare a questionnaire to ask about the influences of a criterion to other criteria. The interrelationships among the criteria are calculated by adopting fuzzy interpretative structural modeling (FISM). Based on the results from the FISM, a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) questionnaire is given out, and the results are used to determine the priorities of the criteria. In addition, the final ranking of the senior daycare center locations can be obtained.

Wines represent a perfect example of beverage in which ageing is a crucial technological manufacturing step. During winemaking, producers accelerate chemical changes in wine composition by traditional and alternative methods, such as the use of oak wood barrels and/or oak wood chips. Our research aimed to investigate the overall volatile composition and sensory quality of red wines aged for two timeframes, namely, 1.5 and 3 months, and with two technological variants, i.e., American and French oak wood chips. Red grapes from the Fetească neagră (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) variety were harvested from a vineyard in the North-East region of Romania. Stir bar sorptive extraction and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (SBSE-GC-MS) was used to extract minor aromas present in wine samples.

Furthermore, ageing for 3 months increased the concentration of <i>cis</i>-whiskey lactone and guaiacol in American oak-treated wine samples. For wines aged with French oak chips, we observed higher concentrations of furfural, 5-methylfurfural, 4-vinylguaiacol, and <i>trans</i>-whiskey lactone. The increased presence of chemical compounds in wine aged with French oak chips generated prominent smoky, licorice, and toasty aromas, whereas in wines aged with American oak chips, notes of vanilla, toasty, and cacao aromas were noticed.

The mild form, osteopenia, is often a precursor of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a pathological condition and a global health problem as it is one of the most common diseases in developed countries. Finding solutions for prevention and therapy should be prioritized. Therefore, the critically appraised topic focuses on strength training as a treatment to counteract a further decline in BMD in older adults. Clinical Question: Is strength training beneficial in increasing BMD in older people with osteopenia or osteoporosis? Summary of Key Findings: Four of the 5 reviewed studies with the highest evidence showed a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD after strength training interventions in comparison with control groups. The fifth study confirmed the maintenance of lumbar spine density due to conducted exercises. Moreover, 3 reviewed studies revealed increasing BMD at the femoral neck after strength training when compared with controls, which appeared significant in 2 of them. Clinical Bottom Line: The findings indicate that strength training has a significant positive influence on BMD in older women (ie, postmenopausal) with osteoporosis or osteopenia. However, it is not recommended to only rely on strength training as the increase of BMD may not appear fast enough to reach the minimal desired values. A combination of strength training and supplements/medication seems most adequate. Generalization of the findings to older men with reduced BMD should be done with caution due to the lack of studies. Strength of Recommendation: There is grade B of recommendation to support the validity of strength training for older women in postmenopausal phase with reduced BMD.</AbstractText>"}

While some strategies, such as cognitive training, exercise or socio-intellectual engagement, appear beneficial, few studies have examined the association between personality and intervention efficacy. A systematic review was therefore conducted to summarise and synthesise the literature regarding the influence of personality traits on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive ageing. A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science was carried out. Of the 2100 papers identified by the search strategy, 10 studies were retained that met the relevant criteria (e.g., intervention studies with one or more cognitive outcomes and a measure of personality). Of these, two studies reported that higher levels of Openness to Experience were associated with greater improvement in memory performance after cognitive training interventions. Another found a positive association between Openness and improvement in divergent thinking following a novel group-based problem solving programme. One social intervention study reported positive moderating effects of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and mixed effects of Extraversion. Mixed evidence was also found regarding Need for Cognition, with one study reporting a positive association with memory improvement and another reporting less improvement in divergent thinking. Others found no evidence of personality influencing intervention outcomes. Due to the relatively small and heterogeneous sample of studies identified, any conclusions should currently be considered preliminary. These findings highlight the need for further research exploring the role of personality in intervention efficacy, so that interventions might be better tailored to individuals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

HIF-signaling is central to many human diseases and mediates longevity in the nematode.

We used RNA interactome capture (RIC) in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and vhl-1 loss-of-function mutants to fill this gap. This approach identifies more than 1,300 nematode RBPs, 270 of which can be considered novel RBPs. Interestingly, loss of vhl-1 modulates the RBPome. This difference is not primarily explained by protein abundance suggesting differential RNA-binding. Taken together, our study provides a global view on the nematode RBPome and proteome as well as their modulation by HIF-signaling.

Historically, the field has focused on failures to initially remember a prospective memory task (omission errors), but interestingly, individuals will occasionally repeat a prospective memory action after it has been completed (e.g., double dosing). These failures in prospective memory deactivation/forgetting are termed commission errors. The current registered study investigated structural neuroimaging correlates of a laboratory measure of commission errors in 47 healthy older adults. Extant theories differed in their predicted outcomes: commission error risk was predicted to be highest in individuals with smaller medial temporal lobe volume (output monitoring theory), larger lateral prefrontal cortex volume (residual activation theory), or a combination of larger medial temporal lobe volume and smaller lateral prefrontal cortex volume (dual mechanisms theory). In registered analyses, we found that a higher number of commission errors was associated with larger medial temporal lobe/hippocampal grey matter volume (supporting dual mechanisms theory), but not with grey or white matter volume in the lateral parietal lobe, frontal pole, or a composite of ventrolateral/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (not supporting dual mechanisms theory). In post hoc analyses, smaller volume in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was associated with a higher number of commission errors, possibly indicating that the dual mechanisms theory of PFC control was conceptually correct, but that a different PFC subregion than anticipated exerts control over commission errors. Collectively, the registered and post hoc analysis findings showed a functional dissociation across MTL/PFC regions that was more consistent with the dual mechanisms theory than the alternative theories.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The truncated lamin A protein produced 'progerin' has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also found that calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D, rescues RS and represses the cGAS/STING/IFN cascade. Here, the mechanisms underlying RS in progerin-expressing cells and the rescue by calcitriol are explored. It is found that progerin elicits a marked downregulation of RAD51, concomitant with increased levels of phosphorylated-RPA, a marker of RS. Interestingly, calcitriol prevents RS and activation of the cGAS/STING/IFN response in part through maintenance of RAD51 levels in progerin-expressing cells. Thus, loss of RAD51 is one of the consequences of progerin expression that can contribute to RS and activation of the IFN response. Stabilization of RAD51 helps explain the beneficial effects of calcitriol in these processes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

NCWS elicits a wide range of symptoms including diarrhoea, intestinal discomfort, and fatigue in analogy with other wheat/gluten-related disorders and celiac disease in particular. From the pathological standpoint, NCWS patients only have a slight increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes, while antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and villous atrophy, otherwise diagnostic features of celiac disease, are absent. To date, the diagnosis of NCWS relies on symptoms and exclusion of confounding diseases, since biomarkers are not yet available. Here, the expression levels of selected miRNAs were examined in duodenal biopsies and peripheral blood leukocytes collected from newly diagnosed patients with NCWS and, as controls, from patients with celiac disease and gluten-independent gastrointestinal problems. We identified a few miRNAs whose expression is higher in the intestinal mucosa of patients affected by NCWS in comparison to control patients affect by gluten-independent dyspeptic symptoms (Helicobacter pylori-negative) and celiac disease. The present study provided the first evidence that NCWS patients have a characteristic miRNA expression patterns, such peculiarity could be exploited as a biomarker to the diagnosis of this disease.</AbstractText>"}

However, the underlying mechanisms by which resveratrol regulates postovulatory aging of oocytes are still insufficiently known. In this study, we found that resveratrol could delay postovulatory aging and improve developmental competence of oocytes through activating selective mitophagy in the mouse. Resveratrol could maintain spindle morphology but it disturbed cortical granule (CG) distribution during oocyte aging. This might be due to upregulated mitophagy, since blocking mitophagy by cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment affected oocyte quality by damaging mitochondrial function and it decreased embryonic development. In addition, we also observed an involvement of FoxO3a in regulating mitophagy in aging oocytes following resveratrol treatment. Taken together, our results provide evidence that mitophagy induced by resveratrol is a potential mechanism to protect against postovulatory oocyte aging.</AbstractText>"}

Natural polymers, especially chitosan, are of particular interest due to their excellent biological properties, such as biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and antimicrobial properties. One way to produce chitosan coating is by covalent grafting with catechol molecules such as dopamine, caffeic acid, and tannic acid, resulting in an attachment ten times stronger than that of simple physisorption. Caffeic acid presents an advantage over dopamine because it allows direct chitosan grafting, due to its terminal carboxylic acid group, without the need of a linking arm, as employed in the dopamine approach. In this study, the grafting of chitosan using caffeic acid, over surfaces or in solution, is compared with dopamine grafting using poly(ethylene glycol) as a linking arm. The following coating properties are observed; covering and homogeneity are assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses, hydrophilicity with contact angle measurements, stability with aging tests, anticorrosion behavior, and coating non-toxicity. Results show that grafting using caffeic acid/chitosan in solution over a metallic surface may be advantageous, compared to traditional dopamine coating.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

To cope with drought stress, plants have isohydric or anisohydric water use strategies. Ozone enters plant tissues through stomata. Therefore, stomatal closure can be interpreted as avoidance to O<sub>3</sub> stress. Here we applied an optimization model of stomata involving water, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> flux to test whether isohydric and anisohydric strategies may affect avoidance of O<sub>3</sub> stress by stomatal closure in four Mediterranean tree species during drought. The data suggest that stomatal closure represents a response to avoid damage to the photosynthetic mechanisms under elevated O<sub>3</sub> depending on plant water use strategy. Under high O<sub>3</sub> and well-watered conditions, isohydric species limited O<sub>3</sub> fluxes by stomatal closure, while anisohydric species activated a tolerance response and did not actively close stomata. Under both O<sub>3</sub> and drought stress, however, anisohydric species enhanced the capacity of avoidance by closing stomata to cope with the severe oxidative stress. In the late growing season, regardless of the water use strategy, the efficiency of O<sub>3</sub> stress avoidance decreased with leaf ageing. As a result, carbon assimilation rate was decreased by O<sub>3</sub> while stomata did not close enough to limit transpirational water losses. This article is protected by copyright.

The modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era has resulted in PLWH living normal life spans with resulting increased comorbidities. CPs have long been a part of the multidisciplinary management of ART. However, with the changing demographics of PLWH and health-care system dynamics, CPs have had the opportunity to expand their role. This includes involvement in managing increasing comorbidities with expanding and more complicated medication regimens, drug interaction monitoring, and optimizing transitions of care, all while recognizing and addressing barriers to successful HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. In addition, with the expansion of HIV prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services, CPs have the opportunity to be involved in HIV prevention. This study summarizes the literature evaluating the impact of CPs in the management of PLWH in the era of modern ART. We conducted a literature search to identify studies that assessed the CP role in HIV clinical practice since 2006. The identified studies were grouped into two categories. The first was HIV related outcomes, including interventions on regimen selection, adherence, regimen optimization, and management of treatment failure. The second group of studies pertained to aging and vulnerable populations, including management of comorbidities, transitions of care, medication-assisted treatment, hepatitis C, and HIV screening and PrEP.

Also, rodent models of circadian arrhythmia, such as the constitutive knockout of the clock gene Bmal1, leads to metabolic disturbances and early death. Although astrocyte clock regulates molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms, its involvement in the regulation of energy balance and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that astrocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1 is sufficient to alter energy balance, glucose homeostasis, and reduce lifespan. Mutant animals displayed impaired hypothalamic molecular clock, age-dependent astrogliosis, apoptosis of hypothalamic astrocytes, and increased glutamate and GABA levels. Importantly, modulation of GABAA-receptor signaling completely restored glutamate levels, delayed the reactive gliosis as well as the metabolic phenotypes and expanded the lifespan of the mutants.

Recent evidence suggests that hearing-impaired individuals have greater risks of developing cognitive impairment and dementia compared to people with intact auditory function, although the neurobiological bases underlying these associations are poorly understood. Here, a colony of aging macaques completed a battery of behavioral tests designed to probe frontal and temporal lobe-dependent cognition. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and visual evoked potentials were measured to assess auditory and visual system function. Structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging were then performed to evaluate the microstructural condition of multiple white matter tracts associated with cognition. Animals showing higher cognitive function had significantly better auditory processing capacities, and these associations were selectively observed with tasks that primarily depend on temporal lobe brain structures. Tractography analyses revealed that the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fimbria-fornix and hippocampal commissure were associated with temporal lobe-dependent visual discrimination performance and auditory sensory function.

Individuals with higher educational attainment may develop greater brain pathology prior to the onset of cognitive decline. However, whether education moderates relations between central artery aging and cognitive performance is unknown. We hypothesized that years of formal education would moderate the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance in middle-aged/older (MA/O) adults (n = 113, age 67.3 ± 0.7 years). Significant interactions between education*central systolic BP (β = .21, p = .02) and education*central PP (β = .22, p = .01) demonstrated weaker associations between central BP and PP with processing speed performance in those with higher education. Similarly, education moderated the relation between aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, cfPWV) and executive function performance (β = .21, p = .02). To test if the relation between central arterial aging and cognitive performance was captured by a predetermined education threshold, MA/O adults were secondarily categorized as ≤high school (HS) (i.e., ≤12 years, n = 36) or &gt;HS (≥13 years, n = 77). Higher central systolic BP was associated with slower processing speed (≤HS: r = -.59, p &lt; .001 vs. &gt;HS: r = -.25, p = .03) and weaker executive function (r = -.39, p = .03 vs. r = -.32, p = .006). Higher cfPWV was selectively correlated with weaker executive function performance (r = -.39, p = .03) in ≤HS only and this association significantly differed between education groups.

Maf1 is negatively regulated via phosphorylation by the mTOR pathway, which governs protein synthesis, growth control, and lifespan regulation in response to nutrient availability. Inhibiting the mTOR pathway extends lifespan in various organisms. However, the downstream effectors for the regulation of cell homeostasis that are critical to lifespan extension remain elusive. Here we show that fission yeast Maf1 is required for lifespan extension. Maf1's function in tRNA repression is inhibited by mTOR-dependent phosphorylation, whereas Maf1 is activated via dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase complexes, PP4 and PP2A. Mutational analysis reveals that Maf1 phosphorylation status influences lifespan, which is correlated with elevated tRNA and protein synthesis levels in maf1∆ cells. However, mTOR downregulation, which negates protein synthesis, fails to rescue the short lifespan of maf1∆ cells, suggesting that elevated protein synthesis is not a cause of lifespan shortening in maf1∆ cells. Interestingly, maf1∆ cells accumulate DNA damage represented by formation of Rad52 DNA damage foci and Rad52 recruitment at tRNA genes. Loss of the Rad52 DNA repair protein further exacerbates the shortened lifespan of maf1∆ cells. Strikingly, PP4 deletion alleviates DNA damage and rescues the short lifespan of maf1∆ cells even though tRNA synthesis is increased in this condition, suggesting that elevated DNA damage is the major cause of lifespan shortening in maf1∆ cells. We propose that Maf1-dependent inhibition of tRNA synthesis controls fission yeast lifespan by preventing genomic instability that arises at tRNA genes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we created a mouse model in which progerin, the lamin A mutant protein that causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), can be inducibly overexpressed. Muscle-specific overexpression of progerin was sufficient to induce muscular dystrophy and alter whole-body energy expenditure, leading to premature death. Intriguingly, sarcolipin (Sln), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein involved in heat production, is upregulated in progerin-expressing and Lmna knockout (Lmna<sup>-/-</sup> ) skeletal muscle. The depletion of Sln accelerated the early death of Lmna<sup>-/-</sup> mice. An examination at the molecular level revealed that progerin recruits Sln and Calnexin to the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, progerin-expressing myoblasts presented enhanced store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, as well as increased co-localization of STIM1 and ORAI1. These findings suggest that progerin dysregulates calcium homeostasis through an interaction with a subset of ER-associated proteins, resulting in thermogenic and metabolic abnormalities.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Most older individuals are affected by multiple chronic diseases, leading to complex drug treatments and increased risk of physical and cognitive disability. Improving or preserving the health and quality of life of these individuals is challenging due to a lack of well-established clinical guidelines. Physicians are often forced to engage in cycles of 'trial and error' that are centered on palliative treatment of symptoms rather than the root cause, often resulting in dubious outcomes. Recently, geroscience challenged this view, proposing that the underlying biological mechanisms of aging are central to the global increase in susceptibility to disease and disability that occurs with aging. In fact, strong correlations have recently been revealed between health dimensions and phenotypes that are typical of aging, especially with autophagy, mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and DNA methylation. Current research focuses on measuring the pace of aging to identify individuals who are 'aging faster' to test and develop interventions that could prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and disability with aging. Understanding how the underlying biological mechanisms of aging connect to and impact longitudinal changes in health trajectories offers a unique opportunity to identify resilience mechanisms, their dynamic changes, and their impact on stress responses. Harnessing how to evoke and control resilience mechanisms in individuals with successful aging could lead to writing a new chapter in human medicine.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Within this context, domiciliary services are increasingly failing to deliver care that respects the individuality and heterogeneity of older people. To date, there has been limited research in the U.K. that explores, from the older person's perspective, how care practices interact with self. Using biographical-narrative methodology, this study takes a constructionist approach to understand the individual's lived experience of care and how it interacts with sense of self. A three-stage model of data collection was used, beginning with a narrative biographic enquiry, exploring with participants (65 yrs +, n = 17) their journeys into care and any possible relationship to personal identity. Stage 2 involved a two-week period of diary completion, with participants recording daily reflections on their care experiences. In stage 3, a semi-structured interview explored the diary entries, linking back to the narrative biographic enquiry to reveal ways in which specific care practices interacted with the sense of self. The findings reveal that a strong relationship between older person and formal carer, forged through familiarity, regularity and consistency, plays a significant role in promoting feelings of autonomy. Furthermore, such relationship mediates against the loss of executional autonomy that often accompanies increasing disability. Maintaining autonomy and control was a recurring theme, including in relation to home, privacy and dignity. Feelings of autonomy are also promoted when formal carers understand the unique ways in which individuals experience ageing and being in the cared-for relationship. This paper suggests that a care approach should be based on two tenets. First, a knowledge and insight into the importance of understanding and respecting the older person's continuing development of self, and second applying this knowledge to care through a positive, stable and consistent relationship between the older person and the carer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

While they are necessary for identifying disease-specific neuropathology, they lack a clear and robust relationship with the clinical presentation of dementia; they can be altered in healthy individuals, while they often inadequately mirror the degree of cognitive and functional deficits in affected subjects. There is growing evidence that synaptic loss and dysfunction are early events during the trajectory of AD pathogenesis that best correlate with the clinical symptoms, suggesting measures of brain functional deficits as candidate early markers of AD. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely available and noninvasive diagnostic method that provides direct insight into brain synaptic activity in real time. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis additionally provides information on physiologically meaningful frequency components, dynamic alterations and topography of EEG signal generators, i.e. neuronal signaling. Numerous studies have shown that qEEG measures can detect disruptions in activity, topographical distribution and synchronization of neuronal (synaptic) activity such as generalized EEG slowing, reduced global synchronization and anteriorization of neuronal generators of fast-frequency resting-state EEG activity in patients along the AD continuum. Moreover, qEEG measures appear to correlate well with surrogate markers of AD neuropathology and discriminate between different types of dementia, making them promising low-cost and noninvasive markers of AD. Future large-scale longitudinal clinical studies are needed to elucidate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of qEEG measures as early functional markers of AD on an individual subject level.</AbstractText>"}

Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), in which action potentials recorded extracellularly from a single neuron are used to trigger stimulation at another cortical location (closed-loop), is an effective treatment for behavioral recovery after brain lesion, but the related neurophysiological changes are still not clear. Here, we investigated the ability of ADS and random stimulation (RS) to alter firing patterns of distant cortical locations. We recorded 591 neuronal units from 23 Long-Evan healthy anesthetized rats. Stimulation was delivered to either forelimb or barrel field somatosensory cortex, using either RS or ADS triggered from spikes recorded in the rostral forelimb area (RFA). Both RS and ADS stimulation protocols rapidly altered spike firing within RFA compared with no stimulation. We observed increase in firing rates and change of spike patterns. ADS was more effective than RS in increasing evoked spikes during the stimulation periods, by producing a reliable, progressive increase in stimulus-related activity over time and an increased coupling of the trigger channel with the network. These results are critical for understanding the efficacy of closed-loop electrical microstimulation protocols in altering activity patterns in interconnected brain networks, thus modulating cortical state and functional connectivity.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Prevalence will continue to rise and is estimated to reach 3% of the population in Western countries by 2025. It is the most important cause of hospitalisation in subjects aged 65 years or more, resulting in high costs and major social impact. The current 'one-size-fits-all' approach in the treatment of HF does not result in best outcome for all patients. These facts are an imminent threat to good quality management of patients with HF. An unorthodox approach from a new vision on care is required. We propose a novel predictive, preventive and personalised medicine approach where patients are truly leading their management, supported by an easily accessible online application that takes advantage of artificial intelligence. This strategy paper describes the needs in HF care, the needed paradigm shift and the elements that are required to achieve this shift. Through the inspiring collaboration of clinical and high-tech partners from North-West Europe combining state of the art HF care, artificial intelligence, serious gaming and patient coaching, a virtual doctor is being created. The results are expected to advance and personalise self-care, where standard care tasks are performed by the patients themselves, in principle without involvement of healthcare professionals, the latter being able to focus on complex conditions. This new vision on care will significantly reduce costs per patient while improving outcomes to enable long-term sustainability of top-level HF care.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Imaging roots of growing maize is a non-invasive, affordable and high throughput approach. However, it's difficult to get integral root images because of the block of the soil. The paper proposed an algorithm to repair incomplete root images for maize root fast non-invasive phenotyping detection.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='Results' NlmCategory='UNASSIGNED'>A two-layer transparent stress growth device with two concentric cylinders was developed as mesocosms and the maize seeds were planted in the annulus of it. The maize roots grow in soil against two acrylic plastic surfaces due to the press of the small growing area to acquire more root details during roots visualization and imaging. Even though, parts of the roots are occluded which means that it's tough to extract the information of root general physical construction. For recovering gaps from disconnected root segments, Progressive Corrosion Joining (PCJ) algorithm was proposed based on the physiological characteristics of hydrotropism, geostrophic and continuity with three steps which are root image thinning, progressive corrosion and joining processing respectively. The experiments indicate that maize phenotyping parameters are negative correlation with seed aging days. And specifically, Root Number (RTN), Root Length (RTL), Root Width (RTW) and Root Extension Length (REL) of unaged and 14-day-aged maize seeds are decreased from 15.40, 82.40 mm, 1.53 mm and 82.20 mm to 4.58, 38.6 mm, 1.35 mm and 55.20 mm, and the growing speed of them are changed from 1.68 per day, 8.80 mm/d, 0.06 mm/d, 9.0 mm/d to 0.70 per day, 4.3 mm/d, 0.05 mm/d and 5.70 mm/d respectively.

The experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to evaluate the vigor of maize seeds which has vast application prospect in high throughput root phenotyping area.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Research has yielded mixed evidence about the influence of infant and child mortality in birth cohorts on adult health and mortality. Studies rarely consider the specific role of mortality within the family. We estimated how individuals' exposure to mortality as a child is related to their adult mortality risk between ages 18 and 85 in two historical populations, Utah (USA) 1874-2015 and Zeeland (The Netherlands) 1812-1957. We examined these associations for early community-level exposure to infant and early (before sixth birthday) and late (before eighteenth birthday) childhood mortality as well as exposure during these ages to sibling deaths. We find that that exposure in childhood to community mortality and sibling deaths increases adult mortality rates. Effects of sibling mortality on adult all-cause mortality risk were stronger in Utah, where sibling deaths were less common in relation to Zeeland. Exposure to sibling death due to infection was related to the surviving siblings' risk of adult mortality due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk: 1.06) and metabolic disease (relative risk: 1.42), primarily diabetes mellitus, a result consistent with an inflammatory immune response mechanism. We conclude that early-life conditions and exposure to mortality in early life, especially within families of origin, contribute to adult mortality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2018.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study aimed to identify the major nutrient patterns (NPs) present in a sample of adult Polish women and evaluate their associations with the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI). A cross-sectional study initially recruited 527 women, and a final analysis was carried out on 275 women aged 32-60 years. Nutrient intake was assessed using fourteen repetitions of 24-hour dietary recall. NPs were derived using principal component analysis. Associations between adherence to NPs and the SMI were evaluated using linear regression models. Three NPs were identified: 'Animal Protein-Vitamins', 'Fibre-Plant Protein-Minerals' and 'Fats'. In the adjusted model, the upper tertile compared to the bottom tertile of the 'Animal Protein-Vitamins' NP was related to a higher SMI (β = 0.123 95% CI: 0.019; 0.227; P for 1-SD increase of NP score = 0.009). No associations between the SMI and the 'Fibre-Plant Protein-Minerals' and 'Fats' NPs were observed. Our results indicate that high adherence to animal product-rich patterns might be related to higher muscle mass in adult women. Research on the influence of dietary and nutrient patterns on the quality of muscle tissue may contribute to the setting of guidelines for nutritional protection of skeletal muscle with ageing and, consequently, dietary recommendations that would improve the quality of women's lives at the later stage of life.</AbstractText>"}

Ageing involves the decline of diverse biological functions and places a limit on a species' maximum lifespan. Ageing is associated with epigenetic changes involving DNA methylation. Furthermore, an analysis of mammals showed that the density of CpG sites in gene promoters, which are targets for DNA methylation, is correlated with lifespan. Using 252 whole genomes and databases of animal age and promotor sequences, we show a pattern across vertebrates. We also derive a predictive lifespan clock based on CpG density in a selected set of promoters. The lifespan clock accurately predicts maximum lifespan in vertebrates (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76) from the density of CpG sites within only 42 selected promoters. Our lifespan clock provides a wholly new method for accurately estimating lifespan using genome sequences alone and enables estimation of this challenging parameter for both poorly understood and extinct species.</AbstractText>"}

Healthy and high myopia subjects were imaged with the SS-OCTA system (PLEX Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA, USA). For each eye, five 12 × 12-mm OCTA volume scans were acquired. The en face CC images were then exported to imageJ and a semi-automated algorithm was used for subsequent quantitative analysis. The main outcome was a quantitative analysis of the CC. This analysis was performed in three different regions: (i) peripapillary, (ii) macular, and (iii) periphery. In addition, CC variables were further investigated in distinct fields within these three different regions. Thirty myopic eyes (32 subjects; myopic group) and fifty eyes (50 subjects; control group) without elevated myopia were included in the analysis. Mean ± SD age was 26.9 ± 2.9 years [median: 27 years; range: 20.0-40.0 years]. Mean ± SD axial length was 26.6 ± 0.6 mm [median: 26.2 mm; range: 26.1 to 28.0 mm]. Mean ± SD axial length was 26.6 ± 0.6 mm [median: 26.2 mm; range: 26.1 to 28.0 mm] in the myopic group and 23.9 ± 1.1 mm [median: 23.9 mm; range: 21.8 to 25.9 mm] in the control group. The total signal void area was significantly greater in myopic eyes compared with control group. The peripapillary region exhibited the greatest total signal void area (p &lt; 0.0001 vs macular region, p &lt; 0.0001 vs peripheral region).

Here, we demonstrate that the human condensin II complex participates in senescence via gene regulation and reorganization of euchromatic A and heterochromatic B compartments. Both OIS and RS are accompanied by A-to-B and B-to-A compartmental transitions, the latter of which occur more frequently and are undergone by 14% (430 Mb) of the human genome. Mechanistically, condensin is enriched in A compartments and implicated in B-to-A transitions. The full activation of senescence genes (SASP genes and p53 targets) requires condensin; its depletion impairs senescence markers. This study describes that condensin reinforces euchromatic A compartments and promotes B-to-A transitions, both of which are coupled to optimal expression of senescence genes, thereby allowing condensin to contribute to senescent processes.</AbstractText>"}

Increasing evidence indicates bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play an important role in adipogenesis and thermogenic balance in adipogenic progenitors and adipose tissue. However, the direct impact of BMPs on hepatic steatosis and possible association with NAFLD are poorly understood. Here, we found that BMP4 was up-regulated in oleic acid-induced steatosis and during the development of high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. Exogenous BMP4 reduced lipid accumulation and up-regulated the genes involved in lipid synthesis, storage and breakdown in hepatocytes. Exogenous BMP4 inhibited hepatic steatosis, reduced serum triglyceride levels and body weight, and alleviated progression of NAFLD <i>in vivo</i>. Mechanistically, BMP4 overexpression in hepatocytes down-regulated most components of the mTORC1 signaling axis. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that BMP4 may play an essential role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and the molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD.

We show that tHSCs co-culture induced significant Nrf2 signaling activation in mDCs. The latter was evidenced by Nrf2-Keap1 disassociation, Nrf2 protein stabilization, accumulation and nuclear translocation. Expression of Nrf2-dependent genes, including <i>heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)</i> and <i>NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)</i>, were detected in tHSCs-co-cultured mDCs. Importantly tHSCs-induced DIgR2 expression was blocked by Nrf2 shRNA or knockout (KO, by CRISPR/Cas9 method). Conversely, forced activation of Nrf2, by Keap1 shRNA or the Nrf2 activators (3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione and MIND4-17), induced significant DIgR2 expression. tHSCs stimulation induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mDCs. Conversely, ROS scavengers inhibited tHSCs-induced ROS production, Nrf2 activation and DIgR2 expression in mDCs. Significantly, tHSCs inhibited production of multiple cytokines (CD80, CD86 and IL-12) in mDCs, reversed by Nrf2 depletion. Moreover, Nrf2 shRNA or KO attenuated splenic T cell inhibition by tHSCs-stimulated mDCs. Together, we conclude that Nrf2 activation mediates tHSCs-induced DIgR2 expression in mDCs.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we investigated radiation-induced carcinogenesis using a model in which the mammary glands of 10-month-old BALB/c mice were transplanted with Trp53-null mammary tissue three days after exposure to low doses of sparsely ionizing γ-radiation or densely ionizing particle radiation. Mammary transplants in aged irradiated hosts gave rise to significantly more tumors that grew more rapidly than those in sham-irradiated mice, with the most pronounced effects seen in mice irradiated with densely ionizing particle radiation. Tumor transcriptomes identified a characteristic immune signature of these aggressive cancers. Consistent with this, fast-growing tumors exhibited an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with few infiltrating lymphocytes, abundant immunosuppressive myeloid cells, and high cyclooxgenase-2 and TGFβ. Only aged irradiated hosts gave rise to tumors lacking cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes (defined here as immune desert), which also occurred in younger mice. These data suggested that host irradiation may promote immunosuppression. To test this, young chimera mice were fed chow containing a honeybee-derived compound with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). CAPE prevented the detrimental effects of host irradiation on tumor growth rate, immune signature, and immunosuppression. These data indicated that low-dose radiation, particularly densely ionizing radiation, promoted more aggressive cancers by suppressing antitumor immunity. Dietary intervention with a non-toxic immunomodulatory agent could prevent systemic effects of radiation that fuel carcinogenesis, supporting the potential of this strategy for cancer prevention.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Bone demineralization and vascular mineralization go often hand in hand in CKD, similar to as in the general population. This contradictory association is independent of aging and is commonly referred to as the 'calcification paradox' or the bone-vascular axis. Various common risk factors and mechanisms have been identified. Alternatively, calcifying vessels may release circulating factors that affect bone metabolism, while bone disease may infer conditions that favor vascular calcification. The present review focuses on emerging concepts and major mechanisms involved in the bone-vascular axis in the setting of CKD. A better understanding of these concepts and mechanisms may identify therapeutics able to target and exert beneficial effects on bone and vasculature simultaneously.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

It is therefore not surprising that most cell types can sense and respond to mechanical loads, similar to their interaction with biochemical and electrical signals. Presence or absence of mechanical forces can be an important determinant of form, function and health of many tissue types. Along with naturally occurring mechanical loads, it is possible to manipulate and apply external physical loads on tissues in biomedical sciences, either for prevention or treatment of catabolism related to many factors, including aging, paralysis, sedentary lifestyles and spaceflight. Mechanical loads consist of many components in their applied signal form such as magnitude, frequency, duration and intervals. Even though high magnitude mechanical loads with low frequencies (e.g. running or weight lifting) induce anabolism in musculoskeletal tissues, their applicability as anabolic agents is limited because of the required compliance and physical health of the target population. On the other hand, it is possible to use low magnitude and high frequency (e.g. in a vibratory form) mechanical loads for anabolism as well. Cells, including stem cells of the musculoskeletal tissue, are sensitive to high frequency, low-intensity mechanical signals. This sensitivity can be utilized not only for the targeted treatment of tissues, but also for stem cell expansion, differentiation and biomaterial interaction in tissue engineering applications. In this review, we reported recent advances in the application of low-intensity vibrations on stem and progenitor cell populations. Modulation of cellular behavior with low-intensity vibrations as an alternative or complementary factor to biochemical and scaffold induced signals may represent an increase of capabilities in studies related to tissue engineering.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this metasynthesis, the authors located, analyzed, and reconceptualized phenomenological research on how life is experienced within and through the body after 85 years. Sandelowski and Barroso's metasynthesis method was employed. Seven databases were searched for primary phenomenological studies. After systematic screening and quality appraisal, 19 studies were included for review. Analysis was guided by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's existential philosophy of embodiment. Findings were organized using Max van Manen's reflective lifeworld existentials. Four ontological dimensions emerged, namely, <i>being</i> in a body (corporeality), <i>being</i> in time (temporality), <i>being</i> in place (spatiality), and <i>being</i> with others (relationality). Each dimension captures a distinct experiential dimension of this stage of the life course. The results suggest vast heterogeneity in the ontological experience of aging, supporting the view that diversity grows with age. The ability to adapt to multidimensional losses was identified as a source of resilience.</AbstractText>"}

These findings imply that ANGII down-regulates TfR1 expression likely via the AT1R/IRP2 pathway, and Fpn1 expression via ATR1/hepcidin and AT1R/ Nrf2 pathways.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

EPA:DHA 6:1 has been identified as a potent omega 3 PUFA formulation to induce endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). This study examined whether intake of EPA:DHA 6:1 (500 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks improves an established endothelial dysfunction in old rats (20 months old), and, if so, the underlying mechanism was subsequently determined. In the main mesenteric artery rings, an endothelial dysfunction characterized by a blunted NO component, an abolished endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization component, and increased endothelium-dependent contractile responses (EDCFs) are observed in old rats compared to young rats. Age-related endothelial dysfunction was associated with increased vascular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of eNOS, components of the local angiotensin system, senescence markers, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the downregulation of COX-1. The EPA:DHA 6:1 treatment improved the NO-mediated relaxation, reduced the EDCF-dependent contractile response and the vascular formation of ROS, and normalized the expression level of all target proteins in the old arterial wall. Thus, the present findings indicate that a 2-week intake of EPA:DHA 6:1 by old rats restored endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations, most likely, by preventing the upregulation of the local angiotensin system and the subsequent formation of ROS.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the most complex cases, in fact, patients must be transferred to the closest Nephrological Referral Center in order to recover kidney function or improve the chance of survival. Other challenges are represented by the progressive ageing of the population and by the management of oncological patients developing kidney complications, for which it would be desirable to create dedicated clinics. However, small hospitals also offer many advantages, such as better work management, the opportunity to attend many training initiatives and congresses, and the ability to better balance career with family needs. Cooperating in smaller teams and the harmony that develops with the other physicians and nurses allows us to offer the best healthcare to nephropathic patients who live far away from the major Referral Centers.

Specifically, we assessed patterns of overlap between diffusion measures of normal appearing white matter by covarying for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load, as WMHs are thought to increase with age and impact diffusion measures. 79 healthy adults aged between 18 and 75 took part in the study. DTI data were based on 61 directions acquired with a b-value of 2000.

We showed that cognitively healthy aging adults had low WMH load, which subsequently had minimal effect on diffusion measures. We discuss how patterns of overlap may reflect underlying biological changes observed with aging such as loss of myelination, axonal damage, as well as mild microstructural and chronic white matter impairments.

However, other steps in virus replication that can be targeted by mA3 have not been examined. We have investigated the possible effect of mA3 on MuLV protease-mediated processes and found that mA3 binds both mature viral protease and Pr180gag-pol precursor polyprotein. Using replication-competent MuLVs, we also show that mA3 inhibits the processing of Pr65 Gag precursor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the autoprocessing of Pr180gag-pol is impeded by mA3, resulting in reduced production of mature viral protease. This reduction appears to link with the above inefficient Pr65gag processing in the presence of mA3. Two major isoforms of mA3, exon 5-containing and -lacking ones, equally exhibit this antiviral activity. Importantly, physiologically expressed levels of mA3 impedes both Pr180gag-pol autocatalysis and Pr65gag processing. This blockade is independent of the deaminase activity and requires the C-terminal region of mA3. These results suggest that the above impairment of Pr180gag-pol autoprocessing may significantly contribute to the deaminase-independent antiretroviral activity exerted by mA3.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare innate immune function of Toll like receptor (TLR)-mediated responses between elderly and young adult women. To this end, elderly and young adult women were compared to study the effect of ageing on the relative prevalence and reactivity to TLR-mediated responses of myeloid- and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDC, pDC). In addition, TLR expression and inflammatory markers in serum were investigated. Elderly women had reduced numbers of circulating pDCs. In addition, pDCs and mDCs of elderly women responded differently towards TLR stimulation, especially TLR7/8 mediated stimulation was reduced, compared to young adults. In serum, markers involved in inflammation were generally increased in elderly.

This trade-off may be further complicated by environmental factors such as nutrient availability during larval development and by the other sex, which influences the costs of reproduction due to the presentation of nuptial gifts. Here, we examined the influence of larval nutrient quantity on the sex-specific longevity costs of reproduction in the gift-giving seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We found no indication that differences in the nutrient quality of larger and smaller host seeds influence survival in virgin and reproducing individuals or nuptial gift size in reproducing individuals. However, in the case of reproducing individuals, the effect of seed size on survival was statistically marginal. Therefore, we advise taking this into account when investigating reproductive efforts in this species. We have also observed interesting interactions between male and female reproductive costs. While females had generally higher mortality than males, nuptial gifts resulted in lowered female mortality and increased male mortality. Additionally, we found a possibly non-linear relationship between nuptial gift size and the offspring production rate of female recipients.</AbstractText>"}

In this paper, we discuss a specific case, MSP-2, and shows its efficacy in reconstructing several non-trivial characteristic properties of social networks, including networks with power-law degree distribution, power-law with an exponential decay (exponential cut-off), and exponential degree distributions. We evaluate the proposed evolution mechanism over two real-world networks and observe that the generated networks highly resembles the degree distribution of the real-world networks.

While aging is the main risk factor, epidemiological evidence suggests that the exposure to environmental toxicants, mainly pesticides, metals and solvents could increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative conditions.<b>Oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases:</b> Mitochondria function impacts cell respiratory processes, metabolism, energy production, intracellular signaling, free radical production, and apoptosis. In neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a compromised energy production, impaired calcium buffering, activation of proteases and phospholipases, and increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced microglial cells activation, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to neuronal deaths in these disorders.<b>Role of nutrition:</b> Neurodegenerative disease is not curable, but treatment is available to manage the symptoms and slow down the disease progression. The drugs for treating these diseases only reduce the cognitive impairment and behavioral problems, but do not stop the progression of neurodegeneration. Healthy diet, lifestyle improvement and nutraceuticals targeting of oxidative stress, inflammation, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and the mitochondrial interaction with abnormal disease-related proteins and assessment of impact of environmental contaminants including occupational exposures to pesticides, can be a promising approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.<b>Conclusion:</b> These innovations can be benchmarked on firm understanding of nutrigenomics and the personalized management of individuals at risk.</AbstractText>"}

However, few studies have quantitatively measured bioavailability, bioactivity, or cognitive short- and long-term effects of these materials against placebo. Earlier clinical studies reported ability of coffee cherry extract (CCE) to a.) reduce levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human blood and b.) to increase serum and exosomal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neuroprotein essential for neurogenesis. Here, we examined CCE influence on cognitive performance. Seventy-one adults with mild cognitive decline completed this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 28-day regimen. Participants engaged in a cognitive challenge that involved working memory processes. Our results suggest that effects of CCE were notable during the first week and persisted throughout the study period. Specifically, participants on the CCE regimens had significant reductions in reaction time compared to placebo when comparing baseline to days 7 and 28 (<i>p</i> = 0.040, partial <i>η<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.130). A main effect of group was not identified for accuracy; however, strong trends were noted between the placebo group and two of the three CCE groups. These results suggest CCE, when taken in the morning or twice per day, is associated with improvements in reaction times and trends toward indications of improved accuracy. Although further research is required, these observations may be indicative of underlying processes such as increased processing speed, sustained attention, and/or focus.</AbstractText>"}

Older adults are slower than young adults in the rate at which this shift occurs, in part due to a reluctance to use a retrieval strategy. The present research employed task materials that alleviate age-related differences in associative memory so that participants could rely on prior knowledge or schematic support. The goal was to determine whether older adults' retrieval reluctance is due to a general avoidance of using the retrieval strategy or to low confidence in their memory for unfamiliar task materials. Participants completed two learning tasks: the Noun-Pair Lookup Task, where task materials consist of unrelated noun pairs, and an isomorph, the Grocery-Price Lookup Task, where task materials were grocery items and prices. In this second task, the prices were either market-priced and consistent with everyday experience or were overpriced. Older adults were retrieval reluctant in the Noun-Pair Lookup Task, replicating previous findings. Stark condition differences were found in the Grocery-Price Lookup Task; older adults shifted much sooner for market-priced materials than for overpriced materials, and young adults shifted much later than expected for overpriced materials, where their final levels of learning were inconsistent with their memory use. Condition differences in retrieval use were substantially larger than the differences in retrieval accuracy. These results imply that confidence in using the retrieval strategy matters for both young and older adults, and that retrieval reluctance is not solely an age-related phenomenon.

In fact, they would even outperform young adults because they more often retrieve arithmetic facts from long-term memory. Nevertheless, we suggest here that the superiority of older over younger adults could also stem from the use of more efficient automated and unconscious counting procedures. We tested 35 older participants using the sign priming paradigm and selected the 18 most efficient ones, aged from 60 to 77. Sign priming is interpreted as the indicator of the preactivation of an abstract procedure as soon as the arithmetic sign is presented. We showed that expert elderly arithmeticians behaved exactly as 26 young participants presenting the same level of arithmetic proficiency. More precisely, we showed that presenting the '+' sign 150 ms before the operands speeds up the solving process compared to a situation wherein the problem is classically presented in its whole on the screen. Only tie problems and problems involving 0 were not subjected to these priming effects, and we concluded that only these problems were solved by retrieval, either of the answer for tie problems or of a rule for + 0 problems. These results could provide new insights for the conception of training programs aiming at preserving older individuals' arithmetical skills and, in a longer-term perspective, at maintaining their financial autonomy, which is decisive for keeping them in charge of their daily life.

Additionally, a high prevalence of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa contributes to a high burden of opportunistic fungal infections. Data generated by GAFFI from 15 of 57 African countries revealed that an estimated 47 million Africans suffer from fungal diseases, of whom an estimated 1.7 million suffer from a serious fungal infection annually. Almost all African countries lack a surveillance system for fungal infections with the exception of South Africa. South Africa is also the only African country with a national mycology reference laboratory. Across the continent, there is a pervasive picture of inadequate/poor diagnostic capacity, low level of awareness among healthcare workers and policymakers and unavailability and non-accessibility to essential antifungal medications. Recent outreach efforts by the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) and the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) have aimed to increase involvement of African countries and experts in global initiatives such as 'One World One Guideline' and also the ECMM Academy. Recently, under the auspices of ISHAM, the African sub-region created a network of mycology experts whose goal is to organise and engage African leaders in the field of medical mycology. The aim of this ISHAM Working Group was to facilitate interaction and synergy among regional leaders in order to develop educational programmes for capacity building to aid in the diagnosis and care of patients with fungal infections in Africa. The working group will also encourage country initiatives to develop clinical guidelines, to support surveys and to support the establishment of reference mycology laboratories.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Particularly interesting in this respect are the roles of galactosylation, which levels are linked to autoimmune conditions and aging, of core fucosylation, which is known to reduce significantly the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and of sialylation, which also reduces ADCC but only in the context of core-fucosylation. In this work we provide an atomistic level perspective through enhanced sampling computer simulations, based on replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), to understand the molecular determinants linking the Fc N-glycans sequence to the observed IgG1 function. Our results indicate that the two symmetrically opposed N-glycans interact extensively through their core trimannose residues. At room temperature the terminal galactose on the α(1-6) arm is restrained to the protein through a network of interactions that keep the arm outstretched, meanwhile the α(1-3) arm extends towards the solvent where a terminal sialic acid remains fully accessible. We also find that the presence of core fucose interferes with the extended sialylated α(1-3) arm, altering its conformational propensity and as a consequence of steric hindrance, significantly enhancing the Fc dynamics. Furthermore, structural analysis shows that the core fucose position within the Fc core obstructs the access of N162 glycosylated FcγRs very much like a 'door-stop', potentially decreasing the IgG/ FcγR binding free energy. These results provide an atomistic level-of-detail framework for the design of high potency IgG1 Fc N-glycoforms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The present study evaluates with multi-parametric flow cytometry the frequencies, terminal differentiation, senescence and effector-functions of peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells purified from liver metastases (CLM) of patients affected by colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to those of sex- and age-matched healthy donors. The peripheral blood of CLM patients underwent CHT is characterized by decreased amounts of Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells showing a relative increase of terminally-differentiated CD27<sup>neg</sup>/CD45RA<sup>pos</sup> (T<sub>EMRA</sub>) cells. The enrichment of this latter subset is associated with an increased expression of the senescent marker CD57. The acquisition of CD57 on T<sub>EMRA</sub> Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells is also coupled with impairments in cytotoxicity and production of TNF-α and IFN-γ. These features resemble the acquisition of an immune-senescent profile by Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells from CLM patients that received CHT, a phenomenon that is also associated with the loss of the co-stimulatory marker CD28 and with the induced expression of CD16. The group of CLM patients underwent CHT and older than 60 years old showed higher frequencies of CD57<sup>pos</sup> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells. Similar results were found for tumor infiltrating Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cell subset purified from CLM specimens of patients treated with CHT. The toxicity of CHT regimens also affects the homeostasis of Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells by inducing higher frequencies of circulating CD57<sup>pos</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> subset in CLM underwent CHT and younger than 60 years old. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the enrichment of senescent Vδ2<sup>pos</sup> T cells in CLM patients is not only induced by patients' aging but also by the toxicity of CHT that further accelerates the accumulation of CD57<sup>pos</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells highly dysfunctional in their anti-tumor activities.

Cancer cells with persistent NRF2 activation heavily rely on NRF2 activity for therapeutic resistance and aggressive tumourigenic capacity. To clarify metabolic features of NRF2-activated lung cancers, we conducted targeted metabolomic (T-Met) and global metabolomic (G-Met) analyses of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in combination with exome and transcriptome analyses. Exome analysis of 88 cell lines (49 adenocarcinoma, 14 large cell carcinoma, 15 squamous cell carcinoma and 10 others) identified non-synonymous mutations in the KEAP1, NRF2, and CUL3 genes. Judging from the elevated expression of NRF2 target genes, these mutations are expected to result in the constitutive stabilization of NRF2. 52 NSCLC cell lines (29 adenocarcinoma, 10 large cell carcinoma, 9 squamous cell carcinoma and 4 others) out of the 88 cell lines were subjected to T-Met analysis. Classification of the 52 cell lines into three groups according to the NRF2 target gene expression enabled us to draw typical metabolomic signatures induced by NRF2 activation. 18 NSCLC cell lines (14 adenocarcinoma, 2 large cell carcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma and 1 others) were further chosen from the 52 cell lines for G-Met and detailed transcriptome analyses. G-Met analysis of their culture supernatants revealed novel metabolites associated with NRF2 activity, which may be potential diagnostic biomarkers of NRF2 activation.

It has a traditional focus on limiting toxicity of specific classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and vancomycin. With more patients in critical care with higher levels of sickness severity and immunosuppression as well as an increasingly obese and ageing population, an increasing risk of suboptimal antibiotic exposure continues to escalate. As such, the value of TDM continues to expand, especially for beta-lactams which constitute the most frequently used antibiotic class. To date, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infectious microbes rather than classification in terms of susceptible and resistant can be reported. In parallel, increasingly sophisticated TDM technology is becoming available ensuring that TDM is feasible and can deliver personalized antibiotic dosing schemes. There is an obvious need for extensive studies that will quantify the improvements in clinical outcome of individual TDM-guided dosing.

The main manifestations related to NAFLD are an unusual storage of lipid in hepatocytes (hepatic steatosis) and progression of inflammation for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is described as a multifactorial complication due to the genetic predisposition, metabolic functions, inflammatory, gut microbiota (GM), and environmental factors. The GM dysregulation among these factors is correlated to NAFLD development. In recent decades, advanced microbial profiling methods are continuing to shed light on the nature of the changes in the GM caused by NASH and NAFLD. In the current review, we aim to perform a literature review in different library databases and electronic searches (Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar) which were randomly obtained. This will be done in order to provide an overview of the relation between GM and NAFLD, and the role of prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as potential therapeutic challenges for NAFLD.</AbstractText>"}

Clinical trials suggest that prompt treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease (EPD) may slow down the disease progress and have a better response. Therefore, conducting proteomics study to identify biomarkers for the diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies of EPD is vital. We aimed at identifying distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD by using the database of GSE62283 based on the platform GPL13669 downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the EPD group (n = 103) and the normal control (NC) group (n = 111) were identified by protein-specific t test. Cluster analysis of DEPs was conducted by protein-protein interaction network to detect hub proteins. The hub proteins were then evaluated to determine the distinct biomarkers by principal component analysis, as well as functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Their biological functions were confirmed by gene ontology functional (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment (KEGG). Two biomarkers, mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (MRRF) and ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18), distinguished the EPD samples from the NC samples, and they were regarded as high-confidence distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD. The most significant GO function was protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO: 0004674) and most of DEPs were enriched in ATP binding in molecular function category (GO: 0005524). These results may help in establishing the prompt and accurate diagnosis of EPD and may also contribute to develop mechanism-based treatments.</AbstractText>"}

Few studies have evaluated age-related alterations in spinal cord microglia. We previously demonstrated that lumbar spinal cord microglial expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was equivalent between aging, neurologically normal dogs and dogs with canine degenerative myelopathy (Toedebusch et al. 2018, Mol Cell Neurosci. 88, 148-157). This unexpected finding suggested that microglia in aging spinal cord have a pro-inflammatory polarization. In this study, we reexamined our microglial results (Toedebusch et al. 2018, Mol Cell Neurosci. 88, 148-157) within the context of aging rather than disease by comparing microglia in aging versus young adult dogs. For both aging and young adult dogs, the density of microglia was significantly higher closest to the motor neuron cell body. However, there was no difference in densities between aging versus young adult dogs at all distances except for the furthest distance analyzed. The number of motor neurons with polarized microglia was higher in aging dogs; yet, the density per motor neuron of arginase-1-expressing microglia was reduced in aging dogs compared with young adult dogs. Finally, aging dogs had increased steady-state mRNA levels for genes consistent with activated microglia compared with young adult dogs. However, altered mRNA levels were limited to the lumbar spinal cord. These data suggested that aging dog spinal cord microglia exhibit regional immunophenotypic differences, which may render lumbar motor neurons more susceptible to age-related pathological insults.</AbstractText>"}

Subsequently, the number of hospitalizations and necessary surgical treatment for older and especially frail patients is significantly increasing. Several frailty scoring systems have been published with the aim of improving the assessment of the perioperative risk for these patients; however, these systems for risk assessment have not yet become clinical routine in surgery and therefore this group of frail patients remains underdiagnosed in the field of surgery. Frail patients in particular often need individualized treatment or the adaptation of standard of perioperative care. It has already been clearly shown that frail patients have a markedly higher incidence for certain risk factors (e.g. postoperative delirium, hypovolemia, pharmacological side effects and drug interactions). Additionally, malnutrition is common at the time of hospital admission in up to 70% of this patient group. If not recognized and treated accordingly all these risk factors lead to a compromised rehabilitation, higher complication rates, a prolonged length of hospital stay and a higher mortality. Special preoperative risk assessment scores, which highlight physical, psychological and social evaluation should be widely implemented in surgical departments. A standardized risk assessment embedded in evidence-based prerehabilitation programs and implemented in geriatric surgery centers can help to improve the outcome in this group of fragile patients.</AbstractText>"}

To assess the impact of the policy on efficiency and productivity change, we investigated the country's health system performance at provincial levels during pre- and post-reform period. Outputs were measured using multiple health outcomes (namely, non-communicable diseases free healthy life years and infant and maternal survival rates), while health expenditure, number of medical personnel and hospital beds per 1000 residents were used as proxy measures for health inputs. Changes in productivity were quantified using a bootstrap Malmquist productivity index (MPI). The analysis focused on the period between 2004 and 2015. This was to capture pre- and post-policy implementation experience and to ensure that enough time was allowed for the policy to work through. Finally, a bootstrap Tobit regression model for panel data was applied to examine the potential effects of contextual factors on productivity change. The result showed that the reform has had negative effects on productivity. Only scale efficiency had improved steadily, but the decline in the scale of technological change observed during the same period meant that the progress in scale efficiency had been masked. Better economic performance (as measured by per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) and higher human resource to capital investment ratio (as measured by density of medical staff per hospital beds) tended to boost productivity growth, while population aging, low educational attainment and higher percentage of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments had adverse effects. Improving health system productivity in China requires improving financial risk protection and maintaining proper balance between human and capital investment in the country.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

An important objective for preventive and/or rehabilitative strategies to improve balance and gait in normal and pathological aging conditions is to focus on physical activity. Activity monitors have recently been getting increasingly popular and represent a modern solution to measure-and communicate-PA notably in terms of steps/day. These activity monitors are well-suited for various populations as they can be worn on a variety of locations on the body, including the wrist and the hip (i.e., the two most common locations), in an undifferentiated way according to the manufacturer's instruction. The aim of this study was hence to verify potential differences in step count (SC) by comparing this parameter assessed using wrist- and hip-worn activity trackers over a 24-h period in free-living conditions in young and older adults. <b>Methods:</b> Young adults (<i>n</i> = 22) and older adults (<i>n</i> = 22) voluntarily participated in this study. They were required to wear two commercially-available Actigraph GT3X+ activity monitors simultaneously at two locations recommended by the manufacturer, i.e., one positioned around the wrist and one above the hip, over a 24-h period in free-living conditions. The manufacturer's software was used to obtain estimates of the SC. <b>Results:</b> For both groups, the wrist-worn activity tracker provided significantly higher SC than the hip-worn activity tracker did. For both placements on the body, older adults exhibited significantly lower SC than young adults. Interestingly, for both young and older participants, the difference between both measurements tended to decrease for longer distances. <b>Conclusion:</b> The different estimations of the step count provided by the comparison between two identical Actigraph GT3x on the wrist or the hip during the 24-h observation period in free-living conditions in young and older adults strongly suggests that caution is needed when using total step per day values as an outcome to quantify walking behavior. Probably we can suggest the same caution across implementation of different activity Tracker.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Mandigout, Lacroix, Perrochon, Svoboda, Aubourg and Vuillerme.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Relative contributions of these two factors are debated. Recent evidence suggests that the latter is rate limiting. In particular, hyperglycemia caused by compromised body control of blood glucose may be a factor of selection of somatic mutation-bearing cells for the ability to use glucose for proliferation. High glucose utilization in aerobic glycolysis is a long known characteristic of cancer. The new evidence adds to the concepts that have been being developed starting from mid-1970ies to suggest that age-related shifts in glucose and lipid metabolism increase the risk of cancer and compromise prognoses for cancer patients and to propose antidiabetic biguanides, including metformin, for cancer prevention and as an adjuvant means of cancer treatment aimed at the metabolic rehabilitation of patients. The new evidence is consistent with several effects of glucose contributing to aging and acting synergistically to enhance carcinogenesis. Glucose can affect (i) separate cells (via promoting somatic mutagenesis and epigenetic instability), (ii) cell populations (via being a factor of selection of phenotypic variants in cell populations for higher glucose consumption and, ultimately, for high aerobic glycolysis); (iii) cell microenvironment (via modification of extracellular matrix proteins), and (iv) the systemic levels (via shifting the endocrine regulation of metabolism toward increasing blood lipids and body fat, which compromise immunological surveillance and promote inflammation).

The four fatty acid tails of CL are usually polyunsaturated, which makes CL particularly sensitive to peroxidation. Peroxidation of CL is involved in the initiation of apoptosis, as well as in some other important cellular signaling chains. However, the studies of CL peroxidation are strongly limited by the lack of methods for its tracing in living cells. We have synthesized a new mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probe sensitive to lipid peroxidation (dubbed MitoCLox), where the BODIPY fluorophore, carrying a diene-containing moiety (as in the C11-BODIPY (581/591) probe), is conjugated with a triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP<sup>+</sup>) via a long flexible linker that contains two amide bonds. The oxidation of MitoCLox could be measured either as a decrease of absorbance at 588 nm or as an increase of fluorescence in the ratiometric mode at 520/590 nm (emission). In CL-containing liposomes, MitoCLox oxidation was induced by cytochrome c and developed in parallel with cardiolipin oxidation. TPP<sup>+</sup>-based mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1, in its reduced form, inhibited oxidation of MitoCLox concurrently with the peroxidation of cardiolipin. Molecular dynamic simulations of MitoCLox in a cardiolipin-containing membrane showed affinity of positively charged MitoCLox to negatively charged CL molecules; the oxidizable diene moiety of MitoCLox resided on the same depth as the cardiolipin lipid peroxides. We suggest that MitoCLox could be used for monitoring CL oxidation in vivo and, owing to its flexible linker, also serve as a platform for producing peroxidation sensors with affinity to particular lipids.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Konstantin G.

There is currently no effective treatment that can arrest or reverse OA progression. Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a member of the zinc finger family, has emerged as a transcription factor involved in a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Here, we identified that KLF2 expression is downregulated in IL-1<i>β</i>-treated human chondrocytes and OA cartilage. Genetic and pharmacological overexpression of KLF2 suppressed IL-1<i>β</i>-induced apoptosis and matrix degradation through the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, KLF2 overexpression resulted in increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) through the enhanced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Further, Nrf2 inhibition abrogated the chondroprotective effects of KLF2. Safranin O/fast green and TUNEL staining demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KLF2 in joint cartilage protects rats against experimental OA by inhibiting cartilage degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that KLF2 overexpression significantly decreases MMP13 expression caused by OA progression <i>in vivo</i>. This <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> study is the first to investigate the antioxidative effect and mechanisms of KLF2 in OA pathogenesis.

Although they play a central role in hematopoietic homeostasis and bone marrow (BM) transplantation, they are affected by multiple environmental factors in the BM. Here, we review the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Nrf2 on HSC function and BM transplantation. HSCs reside in the hypoxic microenvironment of BM, and ROS play an important role in HSPC regulation. Recently, an extraphysiologic oxygen shock/stress phenomenon was identified in human cord blood HSCs collected under ambient air conditions. Moreover, Nrf2 has been recently recognized as a master transcriptional factor that regulates multiple antioxidant enzymes. Since several years, the role of Nrf2 in hematopoiesis has been extensively studied, which has functional similarities of cellular oxygen sensor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 as transcriptional factors. Increasing evidence has revealed that abnormally elevated ROS production due to factors such as genetic defects, aging, and ionizing radiation unexceptionally resulted in lethal impairment of HSC function and hematopoiesis. Both experimental and clinical studies have identified elevated ROS levels as a major culprit of ineffective BM transplantation. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of using small molecule antioxidants, such as N-acetyl cysteine, resveratrol, and curcumin, to augment HSC function and improve the therapeutic efficacy of BM transplantation. Further research on the function of ROS levels and improving the efficacy of BM transplantation may have a great potential for broad clinical applications of HSCs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Linping Hu et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) regulates cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Insulin-like growth factor 1 induces muscle hypertrophy via Nox4, but its function in myoblast fusion remains elusive. Here, we report a ROS-dependent role of Nox4 in myoblast differentiation. Regenerating muscle fibers after injury by cardiotoxin had a lower cross-sectional area in <i>Nox4</i>-knockout (KO) mice than myofibers in wild-type (WT) mice. Diameters and fusion index values of myotubes differentiated from <i>Nox4</i>-KO primary myoblasts were significantly lower than those of myotubes derived from WT myoblasts. However, no difference was observed in the differentiation index and expression of MyoD, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain 3 (MHC) between KO and WT myotubes. The decreased fusion index was also observed during differentiation of primary myoblasts and C2C12 cells with suppressed Nox4 expression. In contrast, in C2C12 cells overexpressing Nox4, the fusion index was increased, whereas the differentiation index and MHC and myogenin protein expression were not affected compared to control. Interestingly, the expression of myomaker (Tmem8c), a fusogenic protein that controls myoblast fusion, was reduced in Nox4-knockdown C2C12 cells. The myomaker expression level was proportional to the cellular ROS level, which was regulated by of Nox4 expression level. These results suggests that Nox4 contributes to myoblast fusion, possibly through the regulation of myomaker expression via ROS production, and that Nox4-dependent ROS may promote skeletal muscle regeneration and growth.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Tae Hyun Youm et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Among the techniques used to study EVs, flow cytometry has a high clinical potential. Here, we have applied a recently developed and simplified flow cytometry method for circulating EV enumeration, subtyping, and isolation from a large cohort of metastatic and locally advanced nonhaematological cancer patients (<i>N</i> = 106); samples from gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers were also analysed. A large spectrum of cancer-related markers was used to analyse differences in terms of peripheral blood circulating EV phenotypes between patients and healthy volunteers, as well as their correlation to clinical outcomes. Finally, EVs from patients and controls were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and their protein cargoes were analysed by proteomics. Results demonstrated that EV counts were significantly higher in cancer patients than in healthy volunteers, as previously reported. More interestingly, results also demonstrated that cancer patients presented higher concentrations of circulating CD31+ endothelial-derived and tumour cancer stem cell-derived CD133 + CD326- EVs, when compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, higher levels of CD133 + CD326- EVs showed a significant correlation with a poor overall survival. Additionally, proteomics analysis of EV cargoes demonstrated disparities in terms of protein content and function between circulating EVs in cancer patients and healthy controls. Overall, our data strongly suggest that blood circulating cancer stem cell-derived EVs may have a role as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 D.

In addition, atherosclerosis is frequently observed in AD patients indicating common involvement of vascular components in both disease etiologies. Recently, epigenome-wide association studies have identified epigenetic alterations, and in particularly DNA methylation changes for both disorders. We hypothesized the existence of a common DNA methylation profile in atherosclerosis and AD which may be valuable as a blood-based DNA methylation inflammaging biomarker. Using publicly available 450k Illumina methylation datasets, we identified a co-methylation network associated with both atherosclerosis and AD in whole blood samples. This methylation profile appeared to indicate shifts in blood immune cell type distribution. Remarkably, similar methylation changes were also detected in disease tissues, including AD brain tissues, atherosclerotic plaques, and tumors and were found to correlate with immune cell infiltration. In addition, this immune-related methylation profile could also be detected in other inflammaging diseases, including Parkinson's disease and obesity, but not in multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and osteoporosis. In conclusion, we identified a blood-based immune-related DNA methylation signature in multiple inflammaging diseases associated with changes in blood immune cell counts and predictive for immune cell infiltration in diseased tissues. In addition to epigenetic clock measurements, this immune-methylation signature may become a valuable blood-based biomarker to prevent chronic inflammatory disease development or monitor lifestyle intervention strategies which promote healthy aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Declerck and Vanden Berghe.</CopyrightInformation>"}

One of the results that were focused on was the fiber phenotype modification and their loss. The physiological muscle recruitment to contraction, basically prosecuted under volitional control, can also be engaged by means of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES). Knowing that the NMES is effective in improving muscle strength in active healthy elderly, the aim was to investigate which physiological modifications were able to produce in the <i>Vastus lateralis</i> muscle and the pathways involved. It was found that NMES increased the cross sectional area and the isometric strength of type II myofibers together with the activated myogenic pathway in order to shift glycolytic toward the oxidative phenotype II myofibers, at a molecular level and with an increase of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) at a functional level. Using the TaqMan low density array on 48 different genes, we found that NMES specific gene regulation highlighted: (i) increased protein synthesis with respect to protein degradation; (ii) the activation of an apoptotic pathway involved in the differentiation process; (iii) increased regeneration signals; (iv) oxidative enzyme regulation. These pathways were validated via confirmatory RT-PCR for genes involved in the regeneration process as well as Myosin isoforms. We also investigated the oxidative stress status analyzing superoxide anion levels, the protein expression of two different superoxide dismutase and the activity of both catalase and superoxide anion dismutase, being two main antioxidant enzymes. In conclusion, data demonstrates that NMES is effective in producing physiological adaptation on <i>Vastus Lateralis</i> of active healthy elderly as well as providing new insights for further research on elderly who experienced muscle detriment for periodic or permanent immobility.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Mancinelli, Toniolo, Di Filippo, Doria, Marrone, Maroni, Verratti, Bondi, Maccatrozzo, Pietrangelo and Fulle.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Here we found that middle- and high-doses of BZD ameliorated the behavioral aspects of 5xFAD transgenic mice in elevated plus maze, Y maze and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, BZD reduced the protein levels of BACE1 and PS1, resulting in a reduction of Aβ plaques. We also identified a beneficial effect of BZD on oxidative stress by attenuating MDA levels and SOD activity in the brains of 5xFAD mice.

While initial brain insult involves acute and irreversible primary damage to the parenchyma, the ensuing secondary brain injuries often progress slowly over months to years, hence providing a window for therapeutic interventions. To date, hallmark events during delayed secondary CNS damage include Wallerian degeneration of axons, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death of neurons and glia. Extensive research has been directed to the identification of druggable targets associated with these processes. Furthermore, tremendous effort has been put forth to improve the bioavailability of therapeutics to CNS by devising strategies for efficient, specific and controlled delivery of bioactive agents to cellular targets. Here, we give an overview of the pathophysiology of TBI and the underlying molecular mechanisms, followed by an update on novel therapeutic targets and agents.

It is noteworthy that PACAP administration rescued impaired synaptic plasticity and learning in animal models of aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's chorea. In this context, results from our laboratory demonstrate that PACAP rescued metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic form of intellectual disability. PACAP is actively transported through the blood-brain barrier and reaches the brain following intranasal or intravenous administration. Besides, new studies have identified synthetic PACAP analog peptides with improved selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties with respect to the native peptide. Our review supports the shared idea that pharmacological activation of PACAP receptors might be beneficial for brain pathologies with cognitive disability.

To ensure an optimal inflammatory response, RIPK1 is regulated post-translationally by well-characterized ubiquitylation and phosphorylation events, as well as by caspase-8-mediated cleavage<sup>1-7</sup>. The physiological relevance of this cleavage event remains unclear, although it is thought to inhibit activation of RIPK3 and necroptosis<sup>8</sup>. Here we show that the heterozygous missense mutations D324N, D324H and D324Y prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 in humans and result in an early-onset periodic fever syndrome and severe intermittent lymphadenopathy-a condition we term 'cleavage-resistant RIPK1-induced autoinflammatory syndrome'. To define the mechanism for this disease, we generated a cleavage-resistant Ripk1<sup>D325A</sup> mutant mouse strain. Whereas Ripk1<sup>-/-</sup> mice died postnatally from systemic inflammation, Ripk1<sup>D325A/D325A</sup> mice died during embryogenesis. Embryonic lethality was completely prevented by the combined loss of Casp8 and Ripk3, but not by loss of Ripk3 or Mlkl alone. Loss of RIPK1 kinase activity also prevented Ripk1<sup>D325A/D325A</sup> embryonic lethality, although the mice died before weaning from multi-organ inflammation in a RIPK3-dependent manner.

Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis was suggested both as a pathophysiological mechanism and as a target for therapy. In the present study, we utilized intracerebroventricular transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a means to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the ketamine-induced neurodevelopmental murine model for schizophrenia. Syngeneic MSC have successfully engrafted and survived for up to 3 months following transplantation. Improvement in social novelty preference and prepulse inhibition was noted after transplantation. In parallel to behavioural improvement, increased hippocampal neurogenesis as reflected in the numbers of doublecortin expressing neurons in the dentate gyrus and gene expression was noted both 2 weeks following transplantation as well as 3 months later compared with nontreated animals. An independent aging effect was observed for both behaviour and neurogenesis, which was attenuated by MSC treatment. As opposed to MSC treatment, short-term treatment with clozapine was efficient only during treatment and diminished 3 months later. Interestingly, while shortly after transplantation (2 weeks) behavioural improvement was correlated mainly to FGF2 gene expression, 3 months later it was mainly correlated to the expression of the notch ligand DLL1. This suggests that long-term effect during ageing may depend on neural stem cell self-renewal. We conclude that a single intracerebroventricular injection of bone marrow-derived MSC can suffice for long-term reversal of changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improve schizophrenia-like behavioural phenotype inflicted by developmental exposure to ketamine in mice.</AbstractText>"}

However, cranial radiation therapy produces long-term impairment in memory, information processing, and attention that contribute to a decline in quality of life. The hippocampal neural network is fundamental for proper storage and retrieval of episodic and spatial memories, suggesting that hippocampal signaling dysfunction could be responsible for the progressive memory deficits observed following irradiation. Previous rodent studies demonstrated that irradiation induces significant loss in dendritic spine number, alters spine morphology, and is associated with behavioral task deficits. Additionally, the literature suggests a common mechanism in which synaptic elimination via microglial-mediated phagocytosis is complement dependent and associated with cognitive impairment in aging as well as disease. We demonstrate sexual dimorphisms in irradiation-mediated alterations of microglia activation markers and dendritic spine density. Further, we find that the significant dendritic spine loss observed in male mice following irradiation is microglia complement receptor 3 (CR3)-dependent. By identifying sex-dependent cellular and molecular factors underlying irradiation-mediated spine loss, therapies can be developed to counteract irradiation-induced cognitive decline and improve patient quality of life.</AbstractText>"}

SP is involved in the neuromuscular mechanisms of cough; reduced concentration of SP may be a marker for increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. The antihypertensive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which also inhibits degradation of SP, has been found to be effective in preventing aspiration pneumonia by strengthening the cough reflex. In this study, we will employ National Hospital Organization self-controlled vocal exercise (NHOEx), which has been shown to improve glottal closure by strengthening the laryngeal adduction muscles. We hypothesize that improved glottal closure by NHOEx may lead to the increase in the plasma concentration of SP, which reflects effective cough reflex. Maximum phonation time (MPT), an indicator of glottal closure, will be measured to assess improvement of glottis-closing function. The study will include 180 patients over 65 years old with dysphonia, dysphagia, or MPT of less than 15 seconds. Based on the speculation that the improved MPT may be associated with changes in SP expression, we will measure the plasma SP before and after 6-month treatment of glottal incompetence using NHOEx. The goal is to verify the reliability of SP as an indicator for glottal closure and swallowing function. Measurement of plasma SP may be helpful for earlier detection of subjects with higher risk of aspiration pneumonia among the elderly.</AbstractText>"}

T<sub>h</sub>1 polarization of T<sub>fh</sub> cells is an important process shaping the success of T<sub>fh</sub>-GC B cell interactions by influencing co-stimulatory and cytokine-dependent T<sub>fh</sub> help to B cells. However, the question remains whether adjuvant-dependent modulation of T<sub>fh</sub> cells enhances HIV-1 vaccine-induced anti-Envelope (Env) antibody responses. We investigated whether an HIV-1 vaccine platform designed to increase the number of T<sub>h</sub>1-polarized T<sub>fh</sub> cells enhances the magnitude and quality of anti-Env antibodies. Utilizing a novel interferon-induced protein (IP)-10-adjuvanted HIV-1 DNA prime, followed by an MPLA+QS-21-adjuvanted Env protein boost in macaques (D<sub>IP-10</sub> P<sub>ALFQ</sub>), we observed higher anti-Env serum IgG titers with greater cross-clade reactivity, specificity to V1V2, and effector functions when compared to macaques primed with DNA lacking IP-10 and boosted with MPLA+alum-adjuvanted Env protein (DP<sub>ALFA</sub>) The D<sub>IP-10</sub> P<sub>ALFQ</sub> vaccine regimen elicited higher anti-Env IgG1 and lower IgG4 antibodies in serum, showing for the first time that adjuvants can dramatically impact the IgG subclass profile in macaques. The D<sub>IP-10</sub> P<sub>ALFQ</sub> regimen also increased vaginal and rectal IgA antibodies to a greater extent. Within lymph nodes, we observed augmented GC B cell responses and promotion of T<sub>h</sub>1 gene expression profiles in GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells. The frequency of GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells correlated with both the magnitude and avidity of anti-Env serum IgG. Together, these data suggest that adjuvant-induced stimulation of T<sub>h</sub>1-T<sub>fh</sub> cells is an effective strategy for enhancing the magnitude and quality of anti-Env antibody response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The results of the RV144 trial demonstrated that vaccination could prevent HIV transmission in humans and that longevity of anti-Env antibodies may be key to this protection. Efforts to improve upon the prime-boost vaccine regimen used in RV144 have indicated that booster immunizations increase serum anti-Env antibody titers but only transiently. Poor antibody durability hampers efforts to develop an effective HIV-1 vaccine. This study was designed to identify the specific elements involved in the immunological mechanism necessary to produce robust HIV-1 specific antibodies in rhesus macaques. By clearly defining immune-mediated pathways that improve the magnitude and functionality of the anti-HIV-1 antibody response, we will have the foundation necessary for rational development of an HIV-1 vaccine.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Verma et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We recently demonstrated the impact of the receptors nectin-1 and herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) for entry of HSV-1 into murine epidermis. Here, we focus on viral invasion into the dermis, a further critical target tissue <i>in vivo</i> In principle, murine dermal fibroblasts are highly susceptible to HSV-1 and we previously showed that nectin-1 and HVEM can act as alternative receptors. To characterize their contribution as receptors in dermal tissue, we established an <i>ex vivo</i> infection assay of murine dermis. Only after separation of the epidermis from the dermis, we observed single infected cells in the upper dermis from juvenile mice at 5 h postinfection with increasing numbers of infected cells at later times. While nectin-1-expressing cells were less frequently detected, we found HVEM expressed on most cells of juvenile dermis. The comparison of infection efficiency during aging revealed a strong delay in the onset of infection in the dermis from aged mice. This observation correlated with a decrease in nectin-1-expressing fibroblasts during aging while the number of HVEM-expressing cells remained stable. Accordingly, aged nectin-1-deficient dermis was less susceptible to HSV-1 than the dermis from control mice. Thus, we conclude that the reduced availability of nectin-1 in aged dermis is a key contributor to a decrease in infection efficiency during aging.<b>Importance</b> HSV-1 is a prevalent human pathogen which invades skin and mucocutaneous linings. So far, the underlying mechanisms of how the virus invades tissue, reaches its receptors, and initiates infection is still unresolved. To unravel the mechanical prerequisites that limit or favor viral invasion into tissue, we need to understand the contribution of the receptors that are involved in viral internalization. Here, we investigated the invasion process into murine dermis with the focus on receptor availability and found that infection efficiency decreases in aging mice. Based on studies of the expression of the receptors nectin-1 and HVEM, we suggest that the decreasing number of nectin-1-expressing fibroblasts leads to a delayed onset of infection in the dermis from aged as compared to juvenile mice. Our results imply that the level of infection efficiency in murine dermis is closely linked to the availability of the receptor nectin-1, and can change during aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Memory impairments are characterized by accelerated decay of spatial memories. Nevertheless the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45) family during aging and cognition, respectively. We report that aging impairs the expression of Gadd45γ in the hippocampus of cognitively impaired male mice. Mimicking this decrease in young adult male mice led to age-like memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Gadd45γ reduction impaired the activity of key components of the MAPK pathway (p38 and JNK) in mouse hippocampal cultures. Furthermore we found that activation of downstream targets, such as ATF-2, c-Jun and CREB was disrupted. Finally, we showed that Gadd45γ is required for induction of key early- and late-response genes that have been associated with aging. Together, these findings indicate that Gadd45γ expression regulates cognitive abilities and synapse-to-nucleus communication, and suggest Gadd45γ dysfunction as a potential mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive impairments.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>A high percentage of subjects experience age-related memory loss that burdens daily performance. Although many advances have been made, the precise changes in the brain governing these deficits are unclear. Identifying molecular processes that are required for cognition and are altered during old age is crucial to develop preventive or therapeutic strategies. Here we show that baseline and learning-induced expression of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45) γ is selectively impaired in the hippocampus of aged mice with cognitive deficits. Next, we show that modeling this impairment in young adult mice with normal cognitive performance disrupts long-and short-term memories in an aged-like manner. Finally, we demonstrate that Gadd45γ regulates synapse-to-nucleus communication processes that are needed for plasticity-associated gene expression.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Healthy aging has been shown to independently affect both of these functions. Here, we investigate how reinforcement learning and selective attention interact during learning from trial and error across age groups. We acquired behavioral and fMRI data from older and younger adults (male and female) performing two probabilistic learning tasks with varying attention demands. While learning in the unidimensional task did not differ across age groups, older adults performed worse than younger adults in the multidimensional task, which required high levels of selective attention. Computational modeling showed that choices of older adults are better predicted by reinforcement learning than Bayesian inference, and that older adults rely more on reinforcement learning based predictions than younger adults. Conversely, a higher proportion of younger adults' choices was predicted by a computationally demanding Bayesian approach. In line with the behavioral findings, we observed no group differences in reinforcement-learning related fMRI activation. Specifically, prediction-error activation in the nucleus accumbens was similar across age groups, and numerically higher in older adults. However, activation in the default mode was less suppressed in older adults in for higher attentional task demands, and the level of suppression correlated with behavioral performance. Our results indicate that healthy aging does not significantly impair simple reinforcement learning. However, in complex environments, older adults rely more heavily on suboptimal reinforcement-learning strategies supported by the ventral striatum, whereas younger adults utilize attention processes supported by cortical networks.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>Changes in the way that healthy human aging affects how we learn to optimally behave are not well understood; it has been suggested that age-related declines in dopaminergic function may impair older adult's ability to learn from reinforcement. In the present fMRI experiment we show that learning and nucleus accumbens activation in a simple unidimensional reinforcment-learning task was not significantly affected by age. However, in a more complex multidimensional task, older adults showed worse performance and relied more on reinforcement-learning strategies than younger adults, while failing to disengage their default-mode network during learning. These results imply that older adults are only impaired in reinforcement learning if they additionally need to learn which dimensions of the environment are currently important.1.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This study investigated the longitudinal association of aortic stiffness and age with decreased cognitive performance in 3 cognitive tests. Methods and Results This study included 6927 participants, with a mean age of 58.8 years at baseline (2008-2010), who participated in the second wave (2012-2014) of the ELSA-Brasil (Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health) (interval between visits ranging from 2-6 years). Cognitive performance was evaluated by Memory, Phonemic, and Semantic Verbal Fluency and Trail B Tests, applied at both cohort visits. Associations with the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and age at baseline were investigated using linear models with mixed effects after adjusting for confounders. After all the adjustments, including for systolic blood pressure, the interaction term carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity×time proved to be statistically significant for Memory and Verbal Fluency Tests, indicating that the higher carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity at baseline was associated with a faster decline in cognitive performance in these tests between waves. The interaction term age×time was statistically significant for all cognitive tests, suggesting that increasing age at baseline was also associated with a faster decline in cognitive performance between waves. Conclusions In this relatively young cohort, and after a relatively short interval, an increased aortic stiffness at baseline was associated with a sharper decline in cognitive performances in memory and verbal fluency, regardless of systolic blood pressure levels.

There were 21 males and 68 females, aging of (56.4±7.9) years (range: 41 to 74 years). The interval between previous left-sided valve surgery and tricuspid reoperation was (14.1±6.1) years (range: 4 to 33 years). A combination of multiple minimally invasive techniques were adopted, including endoscopy-assist right minithoracotomy approach, peripheral cannulation strategy with the vacuum-assist single venous drainage technique, heart beating technique, and temporary percutaneous pacemaker implantation, with a concomitant enhancement in preoperative right cardiac function optimization. <b>Results:</b> All patients received minimally invasive isolated tricuspid valve replacement (<i>n=</i>81) or tricuspid valve repair (<i>n=</i>8). After the application of multiple minimally invasive techniques, the operative mortality rate was only 3.4% (3/89). The causes of death were progressive right heart failure with multiorgan failure (<i>n=</i>1) and low cardiac output associated with postoperative bleeding (<i>n=</i>2). Regarding to the perioperative complications, renal replacement therapy rate was 5.6% (5/89), permanent pacemaker implantation rate was 1.1% (1/89), and the incidence of stroke was 0. Mechanical ventilation time was 24(24) hours, ICU stay time was 2.5 (3.0) days (<i>M</i>(<i>Q(R)</i>)). During the short-term follow-up, there were no case of severe tricuspid regurgitation, 2 cases of moderate regurgitation, 4 cases of mild-to-moderate regurgitation. <b>Conclusions:</b> For severe tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided valve surgery, the advanced minimally invasive techniques can significantly reduce the operative mortality and morbidity. Minimally invasive bioprosthetic tricuspid valve replacement is a reliable alternative for severe tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided valve surgery.</AbstractText>"}

However, these techniques average data over large volumes, obscuring spatially heterogeneous adaptations. The current study used quantitative computed tomography, statistical parameter mapping, and subject-specific finite element (FE) modeling to explore spatial adaptation of the proximal femur to PA. In particular, we were interested in adaptation occurring at the superior femoral neck and improving strength under loading from a fall onto the greater trochanter. High/long jump athletes (n = 16) and baseball pitchers (n = 16) were utilized as within-subject controlled models as they preferentially load their take-off leg and leg contralateral to their throwing arm, respectively. Controls (n = 15) were included but did not show any dominant-to-nondominant (D-to-ND) leg differences. Jumping athletes showed some D-to-ND leg differences but less than pitchers. Pitchers had 5.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9%-7.6%) D-to-ND leg differences in total hip volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), with increased vBMD in the cortical compartment of the femoral neck and trochanteric cortical and trabecular compartments. Voxel-based morphometry analyses and cortical bone mapping showed pitchers had D-to-ND leg differences within the regions of the primary compressive trabeculae, inferior femoral neck, and greater trochanter but not the superior femoral neck. FE modeling revealed pitchers had 4.1% (95% CI 1.4%-6.7%) D-to-ND leg differences in ultimate strength under single-leg stance loading but no differences in ultimate strength to a fall onto the greater trochanter. These data indicate the asymmetrical loading associated with baseball pitching induces proximal femur adaptation in regions associated with weight bearing and muscle contractile forces and increases strength under single-leg stance loading. However, there were no benefits evident at the superior femoral neck and no measurable improvement in ultimate strength to common injurious loading during aging (ie, fall onto the greater trochanter), raising questions as to how to better target these variables with PA. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates in neurons, while in corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), tau also aggregates in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We previously demonstrated that human CBD and PSP tauopathy lysates (CBD-tau and PSP-tau) contain distinct tau strains that propagate neuronal and glial tau aggregates in nontransgenic (nonTg) mouse brain. Yet the mechanism of glial tau transmission is unknown. Here, we developed a novel mouse model to knock down tau in neurons to test for glial tau transmission. While oligodendroglial tau pathology propagated across the mouse brain in the absence of neuronal tau pathology, astrocytic tau pathology did not. Oligodendroglial tau aggregates propagated along white matter tracts independently of neuronal axons, and resulted in oligodendrocyte cell loss. Thus, glial tau pathology has significant functional consequences independent of neuronal tau pathology.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Narasimhan et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, the activity of Cuscuta chinensis Lam. on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis still remains unclear. The present study aimed to assess the protective effect and the underlying mechanism of action of Cuscuta chinensis extract (CCE) against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in vivo. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: control group, osteoporosis group, and 2 CCE-treated osteoporosis groups (100 mg·kg-1·day-1). Blood samples and femur bones were collected for immunohistochemistry, biochemical, mRNA expression, and western blot analysis. HPLC analysis revealed that chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and hyperin were the major constituents of CCE. The results indicated that CCE increased bone length, bone weight, and bone mineral density and suppressed dexamethasone (DEX)-induced reduction in body weight. In addition, TRAP staining indicated that CCE reduced osteoclasts in DEX-induced osteoporosis rats. Mechanistically, CCE treatment alleviated the increase of bone resorption markers and the decline of osteogenic markers, which might be partially mediated by regulation of RANKL/OPG and RunX2 pathways. These results suggest that CCE showed promising effects in the protection against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis through protecting osteoblasts and suppressing osteoclastogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can undergo self-renewal and differentiate into multiple tissue types including bone. We demonstrated that BMP9 is the most potent osteogenic factors although molecular mechanism underlying BMP9 action is not fully understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in many physiological and/or pathologic processes. Here, we investigated the role of lncRNA Rmst in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. We found that Rmst was induced by BMP9 through Smad signaling in MSCs. Rmst knockdown diminished BMP9-induced osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation in vitro, and attenuated BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation. Silencing Rmst decreased the expression of Notch receptors and ligands. Bioinformatic analysis predicted Rmst could directly bind to eight Notch-targeting miRNAs, six of which were downregulated by BMP9. Silencing Rmst restored the expression of four microRNAs (miRNAs). Furthermore, an activating Notch mutant NICD1 effectively rescued the decreased ALP activity caused by Rmst silencing. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that the Rmst-miRNA-Notch regulatory axis may play an important role in mediating BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.</AbstractText>"}

Despite research suggesting this population experiences physical and psychological benefits when doing so, limited research focuses on older adult sport initiation, especially in 'adapted sports' such as walking football. The aim of this study was to explore initiation experiences of walking football players between 55 and 75 years old. Semistructured interviews took place with 17 older adults playing walking football for 6 months minimum (Mage = 64). Inductive analysis revealed six higher order themes representing preinitiation influences. Eight further higher order themes were found, relating to positive and negative experiences during initiation. Fundamental influences preinitiation included previous sporting experiences and values and perceptions. Emergent positive experiences during initiation included mental development and social connections. Findings highlight important individual and social influences when initiating walking football, which should be considered when encouraging 55- to 75-year-old adults to play adapted sport.

Therefore, we compared and analyzed the relationships between markers of inflammation, OS and adiposity in master athletes (MA), young (YC) and middle-aged controls (MC). Fifty-nine participants (MA, n = 30, 51.56 ± 8.61 yrs, minimum of 20 yrs of training; YC, n = 17, 22.70 ± 3.92 yrs; MC, n = 12, 45.54 ± 9.86 yrs) underwent body composition measurements, blood sampling for inflammation and OS measurements, and provided information regarding general health and training status. The MA and YC demonstrated higher catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and higher CAT/TBARS (TBARS: thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and SOD/TBARS ratios. The cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and their soluble receptors sTNF-RI and sIL-6R were lower in YC compared to MC and MA (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, MA showed lower levels of sTNF-RI, IL-6 and sIL-6R and higher IL-10 and IL-10/IL-6 ratio compared to MC (p &lt; 0.05). The body fat was negatively associated with antioxidant enzymes (CAT: r = -0.448 and SOD: r = -0.413) and IL-10 (r = -0.585) and positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α: r = 0.278; sTNF-RI: r = 0.709; IL-6: r = 0.720: sIL-6R: r = 0.430) (p &lt; 0.05). Further, CAT and SOD activities were inversely associated with inflammatory parameters (sTNF-RI, IL-6 and sIL-6R; p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, markers of OS and inflammation did not differ between MA and YC and were associated with adiposity. Moreover, MA were leaner than MC, similarly to YC. Thus, lifelong training clearly attenuates inflammation, OS, and adiposity, supporting an attenuated and healthy aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tumor repressor p53 is required for heat-induced apoptosis at hyperthermia conditions (&gt;41°C). However, its role in sub-heatstroke conditions (≤40°C) remains unclear. Here, we reveal that both zebrafish and human p53 promote survival at 40°C, the heatstroke threshold temperature, by preventing a hyperreactive heat shock response (HSR). At 40°C, both Hsf1 and Hsp90 are activated. Hsf1 upregulates the expression of Hsc70 to trigger Hsc70-mediated protein degradation, whereas Hsp90 stabilizes p53 to repress the expression of Hsf1 and Hsc70, which prevents excessive HSR to maintain cell homeostasis. Under hyperthermia conditions, ATM is activated to phosphorylate p53 at S37, which increases BAX expression to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, growth of p53-deficient tumor xenografts, but not that of their p53<sup>+/+</sup> counterparts, was inhibited by 40°C treatment. Our findings may provide a strategy for individualized therapy for p53-deficient cancers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Human embryonic stem cells can differentiate to diverse cell types of three embryonic lineages, making them an excellent system for understanding the regulatory mechanism that maintains the balance of different cell types in embryogenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) proteins are endogenously expressed during differentiation, and their temporal expression contributes to the cell fate diversity in mesoderm differentiation. Small molecule LY294002 inhibits the IGF pathway to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation while suppressing epicardial and noncardiac cell fates. LY294002-induced cardiomyocytes demonstrate characteristic cardiomyocyte features and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac differentiation. We further show that LY294002 induces cardiomyocytes through CK2 pathway inhibition. This study elucidates the crucial roles of endogenous IGF in mesoderm differentiation and shows that the inhibition of the IGF pathway is an effective approach for generating cardiomyocytes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Using a TNF-α<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model, the present study aimed to test the causal role of TNF-α in mediating the promotion of tumorigenic Wnt signaling by high-fat diet-induced obesity. A 2×2 factorial study was performed with wild-type and TNF-α<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a 60 kcal% high-fat diet or a 10 kcal% low-fat diet. The inflammatory cytokine profile and genes within the Wnt signaling pathway were measured by electrochemiluminescence assay, real-time PCR, Western blotting or immunohistochemistry. The high-fat diet increased body weights in both wild-type and TNF-α<sup>-/-</sup> animals (P&lt;.05), but males were more sensitive to high-fat diet-induced weight gain and increases of colonic TNF-α than females (P&lt;.05). Genetic ablation of TNF-α suppressed the obesity-promoted elevation of Wnt signaling, as indicated by decreased levels of phospho-GSK3β and active β-catenin, two key components within the Wnt pathway (P&lt;.05). The transcriptional expression of several Wnt signaling targets (C-myc, Cyclin D1 and Axin 2) and cell proliferation, as indicated by Ki-67 staining, were attenuated by the deletion of TNF-α in the high-fat-fed TNF-α<sup>-/-</sup> animals comparing with the wild-type animals (P&lt;.05). Our data collectively showed that the genetic deletion of TNF-α attenuated the tumorigenic Wnt signaling, which was otherwise elevated by high-fat diet-induced obesity, and demonstrated a causal role of TNF-α in mediating obesity-associated Wnt signaling, which indicates a potential mechanism of inflammation-driven Wnt signaling for obesity-associated colorectal carcinogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

PEX9 has been suggested to be more selectively targeted than MMP9's catalytic domain in a degrading extracellular matrix under some pathologic conditions, especially in cancer. In this study, we aim to synthesize and evaluate 10 arylamide compounds as MMP9 inhibitors through an enzymatic assay as well as a cellular assay. The mechanism of inhibition for the most active compounds was investigated via molecular dynamics simulation (MD). Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock4.0 with PEX9 as the protein model to predict the binding of the designed compounds. The synthesis was carried out by reacting aniline derivatives with 3-bromopropanoyl chloride using pyridine as the catalyst at room temperature. The MMP9 assay was conducted using the FRET-based MMP9 kits protocol and gelatin zymography assay. The cytotoxicity assay was done using the MTT method, and the MD simulation was performed using AMBER16. Assay on MMP9 demonstrated activities of three compounds (<b>2</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b>) with more than 50% inhibition. Further inhibition on MMP9 expressed by 4T1 showed that two compounds (<b>7</b> and <b>9</b>) inhibited its gelatinolytic activity more than 50%. The cytotoxicity assay against 4T1 cells results in the inhibition of the cell growth with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 125 μM and 132 μM for <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>, respectively.

Our aim was to examine the associations between subjective memory and IADL impairments and all-cause mortality, as well as the mortality risk for reporting both memory and IADL impairments. <i>Methods:</i> Data from the 70-year-old and older cohort in the third survey of a population-based study, the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT3), were linked to the Norwegian Causes of Death Registry. A total of 5802 older adults had complete data from HUNT3 (70.8% of the 70+ cohort). The mean follow-up time was 8.0 years, and 1870 respondents had died. Associations between subjective memory and ADL impairments with mortality were analysed in Cox regression models adjusted for covariates with attained age as the timescale.

Fractional radiofrequency using microneedles or electrode pins was performed on the face, neck, and décolletage. There was heterogeneity in outcomes measurement, but the efficacy of FRF was confirmed in all relevant studies. Mainly, the improvement of rhytides and skin tightening were reported. Mild to moderate pain, transient erythema and edema were the commonest adverse events. Hyperpigmentation was also noted in some cases. There was no consistency in the protocols used and in the description of procedures. A clinical impact score was created to assess the studies and to aid the generation of an evidence-based protocol for minimally invasive radiofrequency procedures.

The Q-LRT is based on a simplification of the quasi-maximum likelihood method for the estimation of model parameters. An empirical application of the Q-LRT is demonstrated for data in a study about aging in men.

The global burden of hypertension is increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity, and is estimated to affect one third of the world's population by 2025. Adverse outcomes in older adults are compounded by mechanical hemodynamic changes, arterial stiffness, neurohormonal and autonomic dysregulation, and declining renal function. This review highlights the current evidence and summarizes recent guidelines on hypertension, pertaining to older adults. Management strategies for hypertension in older adults must consider the degree of frailty, increasingly complex medical comorbidities, and psycho-social factors, and must therefore be individualized. Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions should be encouraged to mitigate the risk of developing hypertension, and as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the need for medications. Pharmacological therapy with diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in older patients. Given the economic and public health burden of hypertension in the United States and globally, it is critical to address lifestyle modifications in younger generations to prevent hypertension with age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In a healthy cardiovascular system, the elastic properties of the large arteries ensure that pulsations in pressure and flow generated by cyclic left ventricular contraction are dampened, so that less pulsatile pressure and flow are delivered at the microvascular level. However, in response to aging, hypertension, and other disease states, arterial stiffening limits the buffering capacity of the elastic arteries, thus exposing the microvasculature to increased pulsatile stress. This is thought to be particularly pertinent to high flow/low resistance organs such as the brain and kidney, which may be sensitive to excess pressure and flow pulsatility, damaging capillary networks, and resulting in target organ damage.

However, the anatomical and functional development of intracellular compartments during this phase of development remains unknown. Taking an organellogenesis point of view, we characterize the spatiotemporal adaptations of the mitochondrial network during zebrafish embryogenesis. Using state of the art microscopy approaches, we find that mitochondrial network follows three distinct distribution patterns during embryonic development. Despite of this constant morphological change of the mitochondrial network, electron transport chain supercomplexes occur at early stages of embryonic development and conserve a stable organization throughout development. The remodeling of the mitochondrial network and the conservation of its structural components go hand-in-hand with somite maturation; for example, genetic disruption of myoblast fusion impairs mitochondrial network maturation. Reciprocally, mitochondria quality represents a key factor to determine embryonic progression. Alteration of mitochondrial polarization and electron transport chain halts embryonic development in a reversible manner suggesting developmental checkpoints that depend on mitochondrial integrity. Our findings establish the subtle dialogue and co-dependence between organogenesis and mitochondria in early vertebrate development.

Age-related decline in fertility is strongly attributed to ovarian aging, diminished ovarian reserves, and decreased developmental competence of oocytes. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of age-related decline in oocyte quality, focusing on oxidative stress (OS) in oocytes. The primary cause is the accumulation of spontaneous damage to the mitochondria arising from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oocytes, generated by the mitochondria themselves during daily biological metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces ATP synthesis and influences the meiotic spindle assembly responsible for chromosomal segregation. Moreover, reproductively aged oocytes produce a decline in the fidelity of the protective mechanisms against ROS, namely the ROS-scavenging metabolism, repair of ROS-damaged DNA, and the proteasome and autophagy system for ROS-damaged proteins. Accordingly, increased ROS and increased vulnerability of oocytes to ROS lead to spindle instability, chromosomal abnormalities, telomere shortening, and reduced developmental competence of aged oocytes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Sasaki, Hamatani, Kamijo, Iwai, Kobanawa, Ogawa, Miyado and Tanaka.</CopyrightInformation>"}

New long-term integrated DH-care approaches, including rehabilitation, are warranted to address these concerns. <b>Methods:</b> The Human Empowerment Aging and Disability (HEAD) rehabilitation program, a new long-term integrated care including DH-care system, was evaluated in terms of efficiency and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in 107 CND patients (30 with Parkinson's Disease, PD; 32 with Multiple Sclerosis, MS; 45 with stroke in chronic stage). All participants followed 1-month of HEAD rehabilitation in clinic (ClinicHEAD: 12 sessions, 3/week), then 1:3 patient was consecutively allocated to 3-months telerehabilitation at home (HomeHEAD: 60 sessions, 5/week). Efficiency (i.e., adherence, usability, and acceptability) and PROMs (i.e., perceived functioning in real-world) were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The rate of adherence to HEAD treatment in clinic (≥90%) and at home (77%) was high. Usability of HEAD system was judged as good (System Usability Scale, median 70.00) in clinic and even more at home (median 80.00).

We performed an assessment of the RNFL thickness in a group of HSP patients, including a longitudinal follow-up in a subgroup. Our aim was to measure and compare the changes and correlate them to clinical progression. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Twenty-three HSP patients were recruited and studied with the SD-OCT including papillary and macular scan by Spectralis.

Thinning correlated with age and disease duration, but not with clinical severity. The longitudinal study (<i>n</i> = 9) showed no significant change compared to the baseline data for the period of observation (mean 10.7 months). <b>Conclusions:</b> RFNL is frequently thinned in HSP with no specific recognizable pattern of quadrants involved and SPG types. The small sample size and the short follow-up time showed no clear progression.

Psychiatrists have been reporting worsened depression symptoms and prognosis by comorbid anxiety symptoms. However, it is still unclear how anxiety affects the course of depression in the elderly. The aims of this study are (1) to identify the symptom network in late-life depression (LLD), and (2) to examine the role of anxiety in LLD with a network perspective. <b>Methods:</b> The study analyzed 776 community-based participants who were clinically diagnosed with depression and enrolled in Suwon Geriatric Mental Health Center. Network analysis was used to investigate the relationships between the symptoms of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The depression sample was divided into groups of low and high anxiety according to the Beck Anxiety Index. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize the effects of depression severity on the network. Network comparison test (NCT) were carried out to compare the global connectivity, global strength, and specific edge strength between the two subgroups. <b>Results:</b> Reported sadness, pessimistic thinking, and suicidal ideation are the core symptoms of LLD in terms of node strength. The MADRS sum score [mean (SD) 28.10 (9.19) vs 20.08 (7.11); <i>P</i> &lt; .01] was much higher in the high anxiety group. The NCT before PSM showed the high anxiety group had significantly higher global strength (<i>P</i> &lt; .01). However, the NCT after PSM did not reveal any statistical significance both in global structure (<i>P</i> = .46) and global strength (<i>P</i> = .26). A comparison between centrality indices showed a higher node strength of vegetative symptoms in the high anxiety group and this also remained after PSM. <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on the statistical analysis, anxiety worsens the severity of depression in the elderly. However, NCT after PSM revealed comorbid anxiety does not change the global structure and strength of the depression symptom network. Therefore, anxiety may affect LLD in a way of worsening the severity, rather than changing psychopathology. Additionally, the study revealed the centrality of vegetative symptoms was low in LLD but increased substantially in patients with comorbid anxiety.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 An, Park, You, Park, Park, Woo, Kim and Son.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although, like many other immune molecules, ICAM-1 plays only a limited role in the abundant concert of the immune response, it may be more important than we realize. In the central nervous system (CNS), ICAM-1 is expressed in microglial cells and astrocytes and in endothelial cells in the white and gray matter of the human forebrain. It is of particular interest in psychiatric disorders for two reasons: It has a key function for the blood-brain barrier, which plays an important role in the biology of psychiatric disorders, and it is a marker for inflammation. Although the blood level of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) might be lower in acute unmedicated schizophrenia, it has been reported to be increased in many other psychiatric conditions, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and dementia. In bipolar disorder, high sICAM levels were found during both the depressed and the manic states and also during the euthymic phase (the free interval), possibly indicating that sICAM is a trait marker. High sICAM-1 blood levels have also been found in depression comorbid to a somatic disease state. Interestingly, sICAM-1 levels also increase during aging. Some studies investigated sICAM-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of psychiatric disorders and ICAM-1 expression in postmortem CNS tissue of psychiatric patients and found that the overall duration and duration of the chronic phase of the psychiatric disorder seem to play a role in both. Moreover, confounders, such as antipsychotic and antidepressive medication, have to be considered. sICAM-1 levels seem to be associated with hypopermeability or hyperpermeability of the blood-brain barrier and thus to influence the communication between the CNS immune system, represented by glia cells, and the peripheral immune system. The balance between the influx and efflux of immune molecules into and out of the CNS may be one of the pinpoints in psychiatric disorders, in particular in the chronic phase, e.g., in schizophrenia. This aspect, however, needs further intense research, in particular to enable researchers to develop therapeutic principles based on an immune/inflammatory approach.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Müller.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Since we previously described the presence of tau mRNA in the somatodendritic compartment, including the postsynapse, and demonstrated that it could be locally translated in response to glutamate, it appears that the regulated translation of synaptic tau can have a direct impact on synaptic function. Using SH-SY5Y cells, we herein confirm that glutamate dose-dependently regulates the translation of tau protein without altering tau mRNA levels. This is supported by the finding that cycloheximide blocks glutamate-stimulated increases in tau protein levels.

Recent studies indicate that motor training closely followed by sleep may result in better engagement of procedural ('how to') memory consolidation processes in the elderly. Nevertheless, elderly individuals are mostly morning oriented and a common practice is to time rehabilitation programs to morning hours. Here, we tested whether the time-of-day wherein training is afforded (morning, 8-10:30 a.m., or evening, 6-9 p.m.) affects the long-term outcome of a multi-session motor practice program (10 sessions across 3-4 weeks) in healthy elderly participants. Twenty-nine (15 women) older adults (60-75 years) practiced an explicitly instructed five-element key-press sequence by repeatedly generating the sequence 'as fast and accurately as possible.' The groups did not differ in terms of sleep habits and quality (1-week long actigraphy); all were morning-oriented individuals. All participants gained robustly from the intervention, shortening sequence tapping duration and retaining the gains (&gt; 90%) at 1-month post-intervention, irrespective of the time-of-day of training. However, retesting at 7-months post-intervention showed that the attrition of the training induced gains was more pronounced in the morning trained group compared to the evening group (76 and 56.5% loss in sequence tapping time; 7/14 and 3/14 participants showed a &gt; 5% decline in accuracy relative to end of training, respectively). Altogether, the results show that morning-oriented older adults effectively acquired skill in the performance of a sequence of finger movements, in both morning and evening practice sessions. However, evening training leads to a significant advantage, over morning training, in the long-term retention of the skill. Evening training should be considered an appropriate time window for motor skill learning in older adults, even in individuals with morning chronotype. The results are in line with the notion that motor training preceding a sleep interval may be better consolidated into long-term memory in the elderly, and thus result in lower forgetting rates.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gal, Gabitov, Maaravi-Hesseg, Karni and Korman.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from <i>Drosophila</i> to humans, here we took advantage of a recently developed tau-deficient <i>Drosophila</i> line to show that loss of tau promotes dysregulation of daily circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Strikingly, tau deficiency dysregulates the structural plasticity of the small ventral lateral circadian pacemaker neurons by disrupting the temporal cytoskeletal remodeling of its dorsal axonal projections and by inducing a slight increase in the cytoplasmic accumulation of core clock proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of tau function participates in the regulation of circadian rhythms by modulating the correct operation and connectivity of core circadian networks and related behavior.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Arnes, Alaniz, Karam, Cho, Lopez, Javitch and Santa-Maria.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore associated with various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), wherein accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria has been reported as an early symptom further contributing to disease progression. In AD, impairment of mitochondrial function causes bioenergetic deficiency, intracellular calcium imbalance and oxidative stress, thereby aggravating the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies, leading to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and memory loss. Although there are reports suggesting intricate parallelism between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation, the factors that drive the pathogenesis of either are unclear. In addition, emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial quality control (QC) mechanisms such as mitophagy are impaired in AD. As an important mitochondrial QC mechanism, mitophagy plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function. Studies show that various proteins involved in mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis are affected in AD. Compromised mitophagy may also be attributed to impairment in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and defects in lysosomal acidification. Therapeutic interventions aiming to restore mitophagy functions can be used as a strategy for ameliorating AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence implicates the role of microglial activation via mitophagy induction in reducing amyloid plaque load.

Twenty-one healthy and independently living older adults were included (11 female, 74.4 ± 7.0 years, range: 65-92 years) and performed 24 trainings sessions (each 40 min) over eight weeks. The first part was conducted in a living lab (home-like laboratory environment), the second part at participants' home. The multicomponent exergame included Tai Chi-inspired exercises, dance movements and step-based cognitive games to train strength, balance and cognition. Attendance and attrition rates were calculated and safety during training was evaluated to determine feasibility. Participants rated the usability of the exergame (System Usability Scale) and reported on their game experience (Game Experience Questionnaire). Physical and cognitive functions and cortical activity (resting state electroencephalopathy) were assessed pre and post intervention. Results showed a high training attendance rate for the living lab and the home-based setting (91.7 and 91.0%, respectively) with a rather high attrition rate (28.6%, six drop-outs). Half of the drop-out reasons were related to personal or health issues. System usability was rated acceptable with a mean score of 70.6/100. Affective game experience was rated favorable. Significant improvements were found for minimal toe clearance, short-term attentional span, and information processing speed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). No significant pre-post differences were found for cortical activity. To summarize, the exergame is generally feasible and usable for healthy older adults applied in an in-home setting and provides an overall positive emotional game experience. Nevertheless, flawless technical functionality should be a mandatory consideration. Additionally, the training might have potential positive influence on specific functions in older adults. However, the efficacy has to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled trial assessing the behavioral and neuroplastic changes in a larger population after a longer training period.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Adcock, Thalmann, Schättin, Gennaro and de Bruin.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, only few studies have examined this link in a longitudinal setting. These investigations have been limited to the correlation of simultaneous changes in WM microstructure and processing speed. Still little is known about the nature of age-related changes in WM microstructure, i.e., regionally distinct vs. global changes. In the present study, we addressed these open questions by exploring whether previous changes in WM microstructure were related to subsequent changes in processing speed: (a) 1 year later; or (b) 2 years later. Furthermore, we investigated whether age-related changes in WM microstructure were regionally specific or global. We used data from four occasions (covering 4 years) of the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project (<i>N</i> = 232; age range at baseline = 64-86). As a measure of WM microstructure, we used mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 10 major WM tracts averaged across hemispheres. Processing speed was measured with four cognitive tasks. Statistical analyses were conducted with bivariate latent change score (LCS) models. We found, for the first time, evidence for lagged couplings between preceding changes in FA and subsequent changes in processing speed 2 years, but not 1 year later in some of the WM tracts (anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus). Our results supported the notion that FA changes were different between regional WM tracts rather than globally shared, with some tracts showing mean declines in FA, and others remaining relatively stable across 4 years.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Oschwald, Mérillat, Liem, Röcke, Martin and Jäncke.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We report a case of hepatic encephalopathy with transaminitis in the setting of hyperammonemia clinically mimicking acute dominant middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome. A 59-year-old right-handed woman had new-onset expressive aphasia, left gaze deviation, and right hemiparesis consistent with MCA stroke. Her symptoms began 12 h after transarterial chemoembolization, a procedure to embolize blood supply and provide cytotoxic agents to a hepatocellular carcinoma tumor. Thrombocytopenia and age-indeterminate hypodensities on brain CT precluded intravenous thrombolytic administration. MRI revealed predominantly dominant hemisphere subcortical restricted diffusion with no cortical involvement. Due to a mismatch between the MRI findings and the neurological symptoms, she underwent digital subtraction cerebral angiography to assess candidacy for intra-arterial thrombectomy, which revealed completely patent MCAs with intact filling of the distal branches. Liver enzymes and ammonia were elevated. The patient was treated with lactulose and intravenous fluids. After normalization of liver enzymes, the patient's neurological deficits resolved. Reversal of this patient's focal symptoms with medical management could potentially be explained by the recovery of blood flow-metabolic demand mismatch caused by worsening liver dysfunction and hyperammonemia. As acute stroke therapies and interventions increase in utility for large artery acute ischemic stroke, it is vital to recognize hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure as part of the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with MCA syndrome.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by S.

Patient care costs continue to rise each year, because there is currently no cure or disease modifying treatments for these diseases. Numerous efforts have been made to understand the molecular interactions governing the disease development. These efforts have revealed that the phosphorylation of proteins by kinases may play a critical role in the aggregation of disease-associated proteins, which is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. Interestingly, a molecular chaperone complex consisting of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) and Cell Division Cycle 37 (Cdc37) has been shown to regulate the maturation of many of these kinases as well as regulate some disease-associated proteins directly. Thus, the Hsp90/Cdc37 complex may represent a potential drug target for regulating proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases, through both direct and indirect interactions. Herein, we discuss the broad understanding of many Hsp90/Cdc37 pathways and how this protein complex may be a useful target to regulate the progression of neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Gracia, Lora, Blair and Jinwal.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The existence of numerous, naturally occurring <i>shaker1</i> mice harboring variable <i>MYO7A</i> mutations on different genetic backgrounds has complicated the characterization of MYO7A knockout (KO) and heterozygote mice. We generated a novel MYO7A KO mouse (<i>Myo7a</i><sup>-</sup><i> <sup>/</sup> </i><sup>-</sup>) that is easily genotyped, maintained, and confirmed to be null for MYO7A in both the eye and inner ear.

In the clinic, many patients who experience an ischemic stroke often further suffer from retinal ischemia, which can inhibit their ability to make a functional recovery and may diminish their overall quality of life. Despite this, no treatments for retinal ischemia have been developed. In both cases, ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction initiates a cell loss cascade and inhibits endogenous brain repair. Stem cells have the ability to transfer healthy and functional mitochondria not only ischemic neurons, but also to similarly endangered retinal cells, replacing their defective mitochondria and thereby reducing cell death. In this review, we encapsulate and assess the relationship between cerebral and retinal ischemia, recent preclinical advancements made using in vitro and in vivo retinal ischemia models, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal ischemia pathology, and the therapeutic potential of stem cell-mediated mitochondrial transfer. Furthermore, we discuss the pitfalls in classic rodent functional assessments and the potential advantages of laser Doppler as a metric of stroke progression. The studies evaluated in this review highlight stem cell-derived mitochondrial transfer as a novel therapeutic approach to both retinal ischemia and stroke.

Previous studies indicate that oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a key brainstem region that regulates sympathetic outflow to peripheral tissues, plays a pathogenic role in obesity-mediated sympathoexcitation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not clear. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory genes and confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress. The present study was designed to investigate whether Nrf2 dysfunction was associated with obesity-induced oxidative stress in the RVLM and sympathoexcitation. C57BL/6J mice were fed with chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Blood pressure parameters were assessed by radiotelemeters in conscious freely moving mice. SNA was measured by heart rate variability analysis and also through assessment of depressor response to ganglionic blockade. RVLM was micro-dissected for gene expression and protein analysis (western blotting and activity assay) related to Nrf2 signaling. Our results showed that HFD-induced obesity resulted in significant increases in SNA, although we only observed a mild increase in mean arterial pressure. Obesity-induced oxidative stress in the RVLM was associated with impaired Nrf2 signaling marked by decreased Nrf2 activity, downregulation of Nrf2 target genes (NQO1 and SOD2) and inflammation. Our findings suggest that obesity results in Nrf2 dysfunction which likely causes maladaptation to oxidative stress and inflammation in the RVLM. These mechanisms could potentially contribute to obesity-induced sympathoexcitation.</AbstractText>"}

However, rapamycin did lead to a persistent increase in abundance of electron transport chain (ETC) complex components, most of which belonged to Complex I. Although ETC protein abundance and Complex I activity were each differentially affected in males and females, the ratio of Complex I activity to Complex I protein abundance was equally and persistently reduced after rapamycin treatment in both sexes. Thus, rapamycin treatment in the aged mice persistently improved diastolic function and myocardial stiffness, persistently altered the cardiac proteome in the absence of persistent metabolic changes, and led to persistent alterations in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. These observations suggest that an optimal translational regimen for rapamycin therapy that promotes enhancement of healthspan may involve intermittent short-term treatments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

While many studies have taken this as evidence to support the notion of age-related deficits in cognitive processing, Ramscar, Hendrix, Shaoul, Milin, and Baayen (Topics in Cognitive Science, 6(1), 5-42) and Ramscar, Sun, Hendrix, and Baayen (Psychological Science, 28(8), 1171-1179, 2017) posit that the decline in performance on various cognitive tasks can be explained by the accumulation of linguistic knowledge over time. To demonstrate this, Ramscar et al. (2017) found that older bilingual participants outperformed monolingual counterparts on a verbal PAL task, proposed to be due to bilinguals having accumulated less information about the words used in the study. However, comparing bilinguals to monolinguals introduces confounding factors. For example, bilingual's better performance may be due to superior executive functioning. To minimize these between-subject confounds, the current study used a within-subject design in order to examine the influence of linguistic experience on paired associate learning in younger and older adults. Linguistic experience was modeled using a semantic diversity measure of word strength (Jones, Johns, &amp; Recchia, 2012). When frequency is controlled for, high semantic diversity words are associated to a greater number of words and have a higher average strength of association. In the current study, PAL performance of older adults was significantly lower for word pairs involving high semantic diversity words, while their performance did not differ for low semantic diversity words, consistent with the information accumulation perspective of aging.</AbstractText>"}

Although therapy leads to virologic suppression and prolonged life expectancies, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains prevalent. While various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, a growing body of literature explores the neurotoxic effects of antiretroviral therapy. Research to date brings into question the potential role of such medications in neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment seen in HIV-positive patients. This review highlights recent findings and controversies in cellular, molecular, and clinical neurotoxicity of antiretrovirals. It explores the pathogenesis of such toxicity and relates it to clinical manifestations in each medication class. The concept of accelerated aging in persons living with HIV (PLWH) as well as potential treatments for HAND are also discussed. Ultimately, this article hopes to educate clinicians and basic scientists about the neurotoxic effects of antiretrovirals and spur future scientific investigation into this important topic.

Chronic inflammation, the principle hallmark of PD, forms the basis of neurodegeneration. Aging in association with activation of glia due to neuronal injury, perhaps because of immune alterations and genetic predispositions, leads to deregulation of inflammatory pathways premising the onset of PD. A family of inducible transcription factors, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is found to show expression in various cells and tissues, such as microglia, neurons, and astrocytes which play an important role in activation and regulation of inflammatory intermediates during inflammation. Both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways are involved in the regulation of the stimulated cells. During the prodromal/asymptomatic stage of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., PD and AD), chronic neuroinflammation may act silently as the driver of neuronal dysfunction. Though research has provided an insight over age-related neurodegeneration in PD, elaborative role of NF-κB in neuroinflammation is yet to be completely understood and thus requires more investigation. Polyphenols, a group of naturally occurring compound in medicinal plants, have gained attention because of their anti-oxidative and anti-neuroinflammatory properties in neurodegenerative diseases. In this aspect, this review highlights the role of NF-κB and the possible therapeutic roles of polyphenols in NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation in PD.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this multitracer PET study was to evaluate the regional expression and co-expression of the transporter proteins for serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Voxel-wise binding potentials (BP<sub>ND</sub>) for SERT and DAT were determined in 27 patients with SAD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, using the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB (3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile) and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I (N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)nortropane). Results showed that, within transmitter systems, SAD patients exhibited higher SERT binding in the nucleus accumbens while DAT availability in the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen correlated positively with symptom severity. At a more lenient statistical threshold, SERT and DAT BP<sub>ND</sub> were also higher in other striatal and limbic regions in patients, and correlated with symptom severity, whereas no brain region showed higher binding in healthy controls. Moreover, SERT/DAT co-expression was significantly higher in SAD patients in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and posterior ventral thalamus, while lower co-expression was noted in the dorsomedial thalamus. Follow-up logistic regression analysis confirmed that SAD diagnosis was significantly predicted by the statistical interaction between SERT and DAT availability, in the amygdala, putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Thus, SAD was associated with mainly increased expression and co-expression of the transporters for serotonin and dopamine in fear and reward-related brain regions. Resultant monoamine dysregulation may underlie SAD symptomatology and constitute a target for treatment.</AbstractText>"}

BrainAGE has been proposed as a biomarker of age-related deterioration of the brain. Having an older brainAGE has been linked to Alzheimer's, dementia, and mortality. However, these findings are largely based on cross-sectional associations which can confuse age differences with cohort differences. To illuminate the validity of brainAGE as a biomarker of accelerated brain aging, a study is needed of a large cohort all born in the same year who nevertheless vary on brainAGE. In the Dunedin Study, a population-representative 1972-73 birth cohort, we measured brainAGE at age 45 years, as well as the pace of biological aging and cognitive decline in longitudinal data from childhood to midlife (N = 869). In this cohort, all chronological age 45 years, brainAGE was measured reliably (ICC = 0.81) and ranged from 24 to 72 years. Those with older midlife brainAGEs tended to have poorer cognitive function in both adulthood and childhood, as well as impaired brain health at age 3. Furthermore, those with older brainAGEs had an accelerated pace of biological aging, older facial appearance, and early signs of cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. These findings help to validate brainAGE as a potential surrogate biomarker for midlife intervention studies that seek to measure dementia-prevention efforts in midlife. However, the findings also caution against the assumption that brainAGE scores represent only age-related deterioration of the brain as they may also index central nervous system variation present since childhood.</AbstractText>"}

We examined the association of cerebral hemodynamics with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and pulse pressure (PP) in 61 older adults with prevalent cardiometabolic risk but no history of cerebrovascular disease. We calculated pulsatility index (PI) and hypercapnic reactivity of the middle cerebral artery, as well as global blood flow through the extracranial arteries. The dominant effects were related to hemodynamic pulsatility. In adults with metabolic syndrome, PI was related to IMT (r = 0.48, P = 0.003) after adjustment for age and sex. Without metabolic syndrome, PI was directly related to PP (r = 0.63, P = 0.003). Across the whole cohort, PP [β (95%CI) = 0.42 (0.18, 0.67), P = 0.001] and IMT [0.42 (0.18, 0.67), P &lt; 0.001] remained significant predictors of PI, after accounting for individual cardiometabolic risk factors. The independent and combined effects of IMT and PP were tested by binarizing PP and IMT at the sample median. Participants with both IMT and PP above their respective medians had elevated PI compared with those with both vascular markers below the median [median (interquartile range) = 1.06 (0.22) vs. 0.84 (0.14), P = 0.003)]. PI was not different from the low risk group if only one of IMT or PP were above the median.

Plasma transthyretin (TTR) levels were measured by ELISA. Survival analysis with time to AD conversion as an outcome variable was calculated with the multivariable Cox proportional hazards models using TTR as a continuous variable with adjustment for other covariates and bootstrapping resampling analysis. In total, 184 MCI subjects and 40 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited at baseline. At baseline, MCI patients had higher TTR levels compared with the control group.

Maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and 4 adiposity markers in children at age 8 (6-11) years were assessed: BMI, fat mass, waist circumference, and skinfold thickness. Relative LTL was obtained. Associations of LTL with each adiposity marker were calculated using linear mixed models with a random cohort effect. For each 1 kg/m² increment in maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, the child's LTL was 0.23% shorter (95%CI: 0.01,0.46%). Each unit increase in child BMI z-score was associated with 1.21% (95%CI: 0.30,2.11%) shorter LTL.

Recombinant SIRT6 displays catalytic efficiencies two orders of magnitude greater for long-chain deacylation than deacetylation against peptide substrates; however, deacetylation can be enhanced by allosteric small molecule activators. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of activated lysine deacetylation and enhanced long-chain acyl-group removal by SIRT6. Activity-based screening identified compounds that activated histone peptide deacetylation 18-48 fold. Chemical optimization based on structure-activity relationships yielded an activator with improved potency and selectivity for SIRT6. Using this novel activator, we conducted biochemical and kinetic analyses revealing that SIRT6 is activated via acceleration of a catalytic step occurring after substrate binding but before NAD<sup>+</sup> cleavage. We identified a SIRT6 variant R65A that maintains basal deacetylase activity, but cannot be activated, and failed to enhance long-chain deacylation. Additional biochemical studies reveal that R65 is critical for activation by facilitating a conformational step that initiates chemical catalysis. This work suggests that SIRT6 activation of deacetylation involves a similar mechanism to improved catalysis as that of long-chain deacylation. The identification of novel SIRT6 activators and the molecular insights into activation and catalysis presented here provide a foundational understanding for physiological SIRT6 activation and for rational design of activating molecules.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Age-associated thymic involution increases the risk of infectious diseases, which results in the immunosenescence and leads to a poor immune function. d-galactose (d-gal) can cause damages that resemble accelerated aging in mice. Gallic acid (GA), as one of the natural phenolic compounds, has been demonstrated to act in antioxidant and anti-tumor effects. In this study, we explored the effects of GA in preventing the age-related thymic involution and the alterations of the forkhead box protein N1 (FoxN1) in d-gal induced accelerated aging mice. The accelerated aging mice model was established by intraperitoneal injection d-gal for eight weeks and given GA with 200, 250, 500 mg/kg body weight per day, respectively, for six weeks. It showed that the d-gal-treated mice developed structural changes in the thymi compared to normal control mice. With supplement of GA, the mice restored the normal thymic anatomy, including the thickening cortex compartment and clearer cortico-medullary junction. The d-gal-treated mice showed a severe reduction in the number of thymocytes, GA mice also displayed the increased numbers of CD4 + T cells through flow cytometric analysis. GA treatment increased the proliferative cells by BrdU incorporation assay and reduced the numbers of apoptotic cells with FITC-12-dUTP labeling (TUNEL). The expression of FoxN1 was also found increased in GA treated mice by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Taken together, our results suggested that the administration of GA opposed the involution of thymus via stimulation of FoxN1 expression and proliferation of cells in a dose-dependent manner.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we discuss converging data, which indicate that one mode by which aberrant DNA methylation can affect ageing is via CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ). This basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factor is controlled by the lifespan regulator mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and plays an important role in energy homeostasis and adipose tissue differentiation. Emerging evidence indicates that access of C/EBPβ proteins to cognate binding sites is regulated by DNA demethylation via ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenases and their adaptor proteins growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 45 alpha (GADD45α) and inhibitor of growth 1 (ING1).

However, there are many ways to be 'well-connected' and it is unclear which aspects of sociality drive fitness benefits. Being well-connected can be conceptualized in four main ways: individuals can be socially integrated by engaging in a high rate of social behaviour or having many partners; they can have strong and stable connections to favoured partners; they can indirectly connect to the broader group structure; or directly engage in a high rate of beneficial behaviours, such as grooming. In this study, we use survival models and long-term data in adult female rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) to compare the fitness outcomes of multiple measures of social connectedness. Females that maintained strong connections to favoured partners had the highest relative survival probability, as did females well-integrated owing to forming many weak connections. We found no survival benefits to being structurally well-connected or engaging in high rates of grooming. Being well-connected to favoured partners could provide fitness benefits by, for example, increasing the efficacy of coordinated or mutualistic behaviours.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we aimed to determine the patient and health-system level factors associated with all-cause and unplanned hospital readmission within 90 days after acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in Australia. Methods- We used person-level linkages between data from the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry (2009-2013), hospital admissions data and national death registrations from 4 Australian states. Time to first readmission (all-cause or unplanned) for discharged patients was examined within 30, 90, and 365 days, using competing risks regression to account for deaths postdischarge. Covariates included age, stroke severity (ability to walk on admission), stroke type, admissions before stroke/TIA and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (derived from <i>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision</i>, [Australian modified] coded hospital data in the preceding 5 years). Results- Among the 13 594 patients discharged following stroke/TIA (45% female; 65% ischemic stroke; 11% intracerebral hemorrhage; 4% undetermined stroke; and 20% TIA), 25% had an all-cause readmission and 15% had an unplanned readmission within 90 days. In multivariable analyses, the factors independently associated with a greater risk of unplanned readmission within 90 days were being female (subhazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.03-1.24]), greater Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (subhazard ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.09-1.12]) and having an admission ≤90 days before the index event (subhazard ratio, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.59-2.15]). Compared with being discharged to rehabilitation or aged care, those who were discharged directly home were more likely to have an unplanned readmission within 90 days (subhazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.33-1.55]). These factors were similar for readmissions within 30 and 365 days. Conclusions- Apart from comorbidities and patient-level characteristics, readmissions after stroke/TIA were associated with discharge destination. Greater support for transition to home after stroke/TIA may be needed to reduce unplanned readmissions.</AbstractText>"}

As such, policy-makers often assume that population ageing will result in unconstrained growth in health spending. However, by applying data on public health expenditure patterns by age from European Union (EU) countries to population projections for both the EU and Japan, we find that health spending growth attributable to population ageing will be marginal through 2060, adding less than 1 percentage point per year to per person annual growth. Applying the same public health expenditure by age data to population projections for Indonesia, we estimate the costs of “scaling-up” a health system to meet the care needs of an ageing population. We find that this too can be modest, especially if investments are made before a large share of the population is at older ages, and if scaling-up is spread out over time. In recognition that future expenditure patterns may vary due to a number of other factors that relate to changes in the age-mix, we develop a series of hypothetical scenarios where per person health expenditures are even higher for older people compared with their younger counterparts than the most recent EU health expenditure data suggest. However, even in the most “extreme” hypothetical scenario presented here, designed to be consistent with an increase in the volume, price, intensity and coverage of services for older people under the public health budget, population ageing only increases the overall EU health spending share of GDP in 2060 by 0.85 more percentage points than it would according to projections based on current expenditure by age patterns; 1.00 more percentage point for Japan; and 1.67 percentage points more for Indonesia, assuming that health spending is scaled-up to reach the EU average over 15 years. Taken together, these findings suggest that population ageing is not, and will not become, a major driver of growth in health expenditures. Policy choices still play an important role in determining the ways in which health spending trends will materialize. Such choices determine how health services are delivered, the prices paid for goods and services, and how coverage decisions are made. While ageing will not become the main driver of health expenditure growth, effective policy options can be implemented to moderate the growth in health expenditures as populations age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© World Health Organization 2019 (acting as the host organization for, and secretariat of, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies).</CopyrightInformation>"}

Increasing the pension age, without addressing the constraints older workers face when participating in the workforce, can have serious negative health consequences for this group of people. Pension ages have been increased in response to improvements in life expectancy, but these improvements have not always been accompanied by reduced disability rates, as people are living longer but not necessarily in better health. Poor mental health is a major source of disability, so improving the mental health of working populations remains a critical policy goal if we want future populations to reach older age in good health and to continue working. A strategy to improve the health capacity of older workers would need to combine three different types of policy and intervention:  workplace-based health and wellness interventions are promising and often underutilized strategies to promote health and increase the work capacity of older workers – not only to reduce health care expenses and injuries, but also to help workers maintain engagement and increase productivity in older age; employer accommodation practices have an important role to play in helping older workers with health problems to stay in work. The social protection system might be critical to ensuring that older workers who experience functional problems do not leave the labour force, for example, by ensuring that disability insurance/benefits policies support the integration of older people into the workforce. Prejudices and misconceptions about the productivity of older workers result in reduced investment in the older workforce, even though they have enormous potential to contribute to the economy. Interventions can support older workers to benefit from workplace programmes and policies to maintain productivity, while at the same time promoting their physical and mental health.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© World Health Organization 2019 (acting as the host organization for, and secretariat of, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies).</CopyrightInformation>"}

We find that:  For countries with a relatively younger population currently undergoing a rapid population age-structure transition, all revenue sources have the potential to grow considerably over the medium- to long-term. The challenge is to improve tax collection and the priority given to health to take advantage of this potential. For countries with a large share of the population at older ages, revenues from social contributions linked primarily to the labour market are expected to decline substantially as a result of population ageing. Three general policy options could address declining labour market-related social contributions due to population ageing. They include:  expanding the revenue base by increasing the number of contributors, such as by increasing migration rates or increasing the effective retirement age; increasing the contribution rate on social contributions; and diversifying the mix of financing sources. Simulations suggest that these strategies in isolation are unlikely to fully compensate for the shortfall in revenues in countries that depend heavily on the labour market to finance health. Health and long-term care financing systems that are heavily reliant on labour market-related contributions may need to be redesigned if they are to continue to generate sufficient, stable revenues in the context of population ageing. This will require political commitment and a willingness to prioritize health. This research underscores the importance of moving away from financing health through labour-related contributions and premiums and, as a result, de-linking entitlement to care from the payment of contributions. Taxation policies can ensure health financing is both sustainable and equitable.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© World Health Organization 2019 (acting as the host organization for, and secretariat of, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies).</CopyrightInformation>"}

A review of evidence and policy options","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aging, Healthy Aging, Health Care Costs - trends, Health Services for the Aged - economics, Health Policy - economics, Long-Term Care - economics","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Population ageing is raising concerns about how to cope with the expected greater cost of health and long-term care, and over the economic implications of having a comparatively smaller share of younger people at traditional working age. This rhetoric is often inspired by misleading metrics, such as the traditional old-age dependency ratio, which assume that people become dependent on society after reaching some pre-defined age. Yet, upon closer inspection, available evidence suggests that care and consumption of a growing older population may not be so costly to finance and that older people provide significant economic and societal benefits, especially when healthy and active:  Population ageing has a modest and very gradual effect on health expenditure forecasts, compared to traditional cost drivers such as price growth and technological innovation. Demand for long-term care is expected to increase substantially due to population ageing but it is coming from a low base currently and is not expected to have a large impact on spending forecasts. However, this does not account for the economic cost of informal long-term care, which is not captured in the international statistics (nor fully understood). Many older people continue to provide paid or unpaid work beyond official retirement age and continue to make a positive economic and societal contribution. The value of unpaid work provided by older people is considerable but difficult to monetize. While in Europe consumption of older people is mainly financed by public transfers, many older people pay for (part of) their consumption from private sources, including from incomes from their own continued work or accumulated assets. Accumulation of asset wealth also benefits the economy indirectly through its contribution to productivity growth and health is a key predictor of asset accumulation. Further, older people, even if not in paid employment, continue to pay consumption and other non-labour taxes, and thus contribute to public-sector revenues. Carefully crafted policies can reduce the costs of health and long-term care of older people, enhance their economic contribution through paid and unpaid work, and support acceptability of funding and income transfers:  Policies to promote cost-effective health and long-term care interventions include the use of technology, integration of health and long-term care, as well as other models of care delivery and supporting better treatment and care choices near the end of life. Keeping older people active in paid work is dependent on a number of factors, not least their health, and importantly the roles and incentives regarding employment and pensions. On the unpaid work side, policies may include support of informal carers through training or cash transfers and interventions that enable carers to combine unpaid care with paid employment. Health and long-term care financing systems may need to diversify their sources of revenue in order to continue to generate sufficient resources. Policies that are being explored include increasing reliance on general taxes or private sources in welfare systems that rely heavily on payroll contributions; the use of hypothecation and the introduction of mandatory long-term care insurance. Overall, acceptability of higher taxes and transfers will depend on the transparency of the process and perceived fairness of the rules. Policies to promote healthy and active ageing, which has an intrinsic value in itself, such as those that prevent or delay care dependency, will also indirectly (through enhanced health and functional ability) help achieve all the other policy goals outlined above. The forthcoming briefs in this series will look at the issues outlined above in more detail in an attempt to gauge how big a challenge population ageing actually is for the welfare states as we know them today.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© World Health Organization 2019 (acting as the host organization for, and secretariat of, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies).</CopyrightInformation>"}

The analysis showed that changes in walking duration during the first 2 years of retirement are directly associated with health change, health change has an effect on long-term QoL, and weight variation of 10 lb or more has an effect on health change and long-term QoL. Although QoL peaks for the sample of retirees at around age 75, people whose average walking duration increased, health improved, and weight did not increase substantially after retirement continued to experience high QoL for a longer time.

Most infections remain undetected but severe forms may develop in newborns and in immunocompromised patients. Moreover, HSV-1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which may include viral infection of the endothelium. Antiviral therapy is efficient to treat symptomatic patients. However, an increasing accumulation of resistance-associated mutations has been observed in the viral genome. Thus, new antiviral strategies are focused on host factors. Among others, signaling of bioactive sphingolipids seems to be important in mediating HSV-1 replication. With the present study, regulation and function of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-based signaling were analyzed in HSV-1-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Our data indicate that viral replication in endothelial cells relies on sphingosine kinase (SK) activity and S1P receptor (S1PR)<sub>1,3-5</sub> signaling, which involves the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and the small GTPase Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac-1). Inhibitor- or siRNA-meditated reduction of Rac-1 activity decreased HSV-1 replication. In general, targeting S1P-related signaling may be a successful strategy to establish new anti-HSV-1 therapies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

As microstructural deterioration increases bone fragility disproportionate to the bone loss producing osteopenia/normal BMD, we hypothesized that the structural fragility score (SFS) of ≥70 units, a measure capturing severe cortical and trabecular deterioration, will identify these women. Distal radial images were acquired using high-resolution peripheral quantitative tomography in postmenopausal French women, mean age 67 years (range 42-96 years); 1539 women were followed for 4 years (QUALYOR) and 561 women followed for 8 years (OFELY). Women with osteopenia or normal BMD accounted for ~80% of fractures. Women ≥70 years, 29.2% of the cohort, accounted for 39.2% to 61.5% of fractures depending on follow-up duration. Women having fractures had a higher SFS, lower BMD, and a higher fracture risk assessment score (FRAX) than women remaining fracture-free. In each BMD category (osteoporosis, osteopenia, normal BMD), fracture incidence was two to three times higher in women with SFS ≥70 than &lt;70.

Orthostatic BP responses were recorded at each 10 second interval and were defined as OH (SBP drop ≥20mmHg or DBP drop ≥10mmHg) at the time-points 40, 90 and 110 seconds. We defined sustained OH (SOH) as a drop that exceeded consensus BP thresholds for OH at 40, 90 and 110 seconds after standing. Logistic regression analyses modelled associations between the candidate SNP alleles and OH. We report no significant associations between OH and measured SNPs after correction for multiple comparisons apart from the SNP rs5068 where proportions of the minor allele was significantly different between cases and controls for SOH 40 (p=0.002). After adjustment for covariates in a logistic regression, those with the minor G allele (compared to the A allele) had a decreased incidence rate ratio (IRR) for SOH 40 (IRR 0.45, p=0.001, 95% CI 0.29-0.72). Only one SNP linked with increased natriuretic peptide concentrations was associated with OH. These results suggest that genetic variants may have a weak impact on OH but needs verification in other population studies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

We used two tasks requiring either force maintenance (straight line target force) or force modulation (sine-wave target force) around different force levels and at different modulation frequencies. Force levels were defined relative the individual maximum voluntary contraction. A group of young adults (mean age ± SD = 25 ± 3.6 years) and a group of elderly (mean age = 77 ± 6.4 years) took part in the study. Age- and task-related effects were assessed through differences in: (i) force control accuracy, (ii) time-structure of force fluctuations, and (iii) the contribution of deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (noise-like) dynamic components to the expressed behavior. Performance-wise, the elderly showed a pervasive lower accuracy and higher variability than the young participants. The analysis of fluctuations showed that the elderly produced force signals that were less complex than those of the young adults during the maintenance task, but the reverse was observed in the modulation task. Behavioral complexity results suggest a reduced adaptability to task-constraints with advanced age. Regarding the dynamics, we found comparable generating mechanisms in both age groups for both tasks and in all conditions, namely a fixed-point for force maintenance and a limit-cycle for force modulation. However, aging increased the stochasticity (noise-driven fluctuations) of force fluctuations in the cyclic force modulation, which could be related to the increased complexity found in elderly for this same task. To our knowledge this is the first time that these different perspectives to motor control are used simultaneously to characterize force control capacities. Our findings show their complementarity in revealing distinct aspects of sensorimotor adaptation to task constraints and age-related declines. Although further research is still needed to identify the physiological underpinnings, the used task and methodology are shown to have both fundamental and clinical applications.</AbstractText>"}

We genotyped 230 CRC cases and 230 healthy controls for 48 previously reported CRC-susceptibility SNPs. Only the rs6687758 in DUPS10 exhibited a statistically significant association with CRC risk based on the crude analysis. The rs6687758 AG genotype conferred about 2.13-fold increased risk for CRC compared to the AA genotype. Moreover, we found significant associations in cases between smoking status, physical activity, and the rs6687758 SNP. The results of a Genetic Risk Score (GRS) showed that the risk alleles were more frequent in cases than controls and the score was associated with CRC in crude analysis. In conclusion, we have confirmed a CRC susceptibility locus and the existence of associations between modifiable factors and the rs6687758 SNP; moreover, the GRS was associated with CRC. However, further experimental validations are needed to establish the role of this SNP, the function of the gene identified, as well as the contribution of the interaction between environmental factors and this locusto the risk of CRC.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, bioinformatic analysis identified a dysregulated circRNA termed circPTPRA in bladder cancer (BC). By using qRT-PCR analysis, we verified that circPTPRA is down-regulated in clinical BC specimens compared with the matched non-tumor samples, while correlation analyses showed that low circPTPRA expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stage and larger tumor size. Based on these findings, we conducted functional assays and revealed that circPTPRA inhibits BC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In addition, RNA pull-down, miRNA capture, FISH, and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that circPTPRA can directly sponge miR-636. Cell transfection experiments showed that miR-636 promotes the proliferation of BC cells by decreasing the expression of Krüppel Like Factor 9 (KLF9) upon binding to the 3'UTR of its mRNA.Further analysis confirmed that circPTPRA competitively sponges miR-636 to upregulate the KLF9 expression, leading to decreased proliferation of BC cells. Our investigation indicates that circPTPRA acts as a tumor suppressor in BC, and suggests that this circRNA may be a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in BC.</AbstractText>"}

Older drivers are at risk for age-related cognitive and visual dysfunction, which may reduce mobility and increase errors that lead to crashes. Understanding patterns of real-world behavior, exposure, and cognitive-perceptual processes underlying risk in environmental context and in older drivers requires new approaches.<b>Methods:</b> We assessed patterns of objective, real-world driver risk exposure and vehicle control related to steering, braking, and accelerating in older adults with a range of cognitive and visual functional abilities. Real-world driver behavior was collected from passive-monitoring systems installed in 77 drivers' vehicles and analyzed across 242,153 km (150,467 miles) driven. Driver behavior was assessed cross-sectionally in relationship to driver functional abilities and safety-critical environmental contexts (roadway type and visibility condition).<b>Results:</b> Results suggest that cognitive dysfunction impairs vehicle control across wide-ranging environments. Drivers with greater cognitive dysfunction showed more erratic braking and accelerating during daytime commercial and interstate driving. Drivers with less cognitive dysfunction showed more erratic braking and accelerating on residential roadways regardless of visibility condition. Greater cognitive dysfunction predicted more erratic steering on commercial and interstate roadways and less erratic steering on residential roadways. Greater visual dysfunction impaired braking and accelerating during nighttime and interstate driving, but not on residential or commercial roadways. Steering behavior was unaffected by visual abilities. Drivers with greater cognitive dysfunction did not appear to reduce driving frequency in higher-risk environments. Visually impaired drivers drove more on residential roadways and less on commercial roadways, but did not reduce driving on interstates, where they showed the greatest risk per mile driven.<b>Conclusions:</b> Results successfully mapped driver cognitive and visual profiles onto contemporaneous, real-world behavior and risk loci. Results link age-related dysfunction to real-world vehicle control and show that drivers may not sufficiently reduce exposure to higher-risk driving environments. Employing naturalistic observation to monitor and measure patterns of driver behavior can inform methods for early detection of age-related risk, fitness-to-drive assessments, and interventions to preserve safety, mobility, and quality of life in aging or other at-risk populations.</AbstractText>"}

Engineering these carriers at micro- or nanoscales makes them potentially useful for broad clinical applications ranging from vascular diseases to tumor theranostics.

We have investigated the circulation dynamics of micro (∼4.95 μm diameter) and nano (∼91 nm diameter) erythrocyte-derived carriers in real time using near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and evaluated the effectiveness of such carrier systems in mediating photothermolysis of cutaneous vasculature in mice. Fluorescence emission half-lives of micro- and nanosized carriers in response to a single intravenous injection were ∼49 and ∼15 min, respectively. A single injection of microsized carriers resulted in a 3-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio that remained nearly persistent over 1 h of imaging time. Our results also suggest that a second injection of the carriers 7 days later can induce a transient inflammatory response, as manifested by the apparent leakage of the carriers into the perivascular tissue. The administration of the carriers into the mice vasculature reduced the threshold laser fluence to induce photothermolysis of blood vessels from &gt;65 to 20 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.

Across repeated mating tests (2-12 months of age), female rats spent more time with the male, displayed more solicitation behaviors, were less likely to leave the male after mounts, but visited both stimulus animals less frequently. Comparing a separate group of age-matched, hormone-yoked female rats mated for the first time at 12 months of age to female rats mated for the first time at 2 months of age showed that the 12 month rats visited both stimulus animals less, were less likely to leave the male after mounts, took longer to return to the male after mounts, and displayed fewer solicitation behaviors than their younger counterparts. Relative to middle-aged female rats once they were sexually experienced, 12 month naïve rats spent less time with the male, were more likely to leave the male after mounts, and displayed fewer solicitation behaviors. Furthermore, 12 month naïve rats failed to discriminate between the stimulus animals, visiting both stimulus animals at the same rate unlike 2 month naïve or 12 month experienced rats.

Typically, this amino acid, which is produced by the intestinal mucosa cells, circulates in the blood at a physiological level of ∼40  μM.

While many factors related to the changes of morphological and structural properties in muscle fibers and the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been considered as possible reasons for causing age-related force reduction, it is still not fully understood why the decrease in force generation under eccentric contraction (lengthening) is much less than that under concentric contraction (shortening). Biomechanically, it was observed that connective tissues (endomysium) stiffen as ages, and the volume ratio of connective tissues exhibits an age-related increase. However, limited skeletal muscle models take into account the microstructural characteristics as well as the volume fraction of tissue material. This study aims to provide a numerical investigation in which the muscle fibers and the ECM are explicitly represented to allow quantitative assessment of the age-related force reduction mechanism. To this end, a fiber-level honeycomb-like microstructure is constructed and modeled by a pixel-based Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM), which allows modeling of smooth transition in biomaterial properties across material interfaces. The numerical investigation reveals that the increased stiffness of the passive materials of muscle tissue reduces the force generation capability under concentric contraction while maintains the force generation capability under eccentric contraction. The proposed RKPM microscopic model provides effective means for the cellular-scale numerical investigation of skeletal muscle physiology. NOVELTY STATEMENT: A cellular-scale honeycomb-like microstructural muscle model constructed from a histological cross-sectional image of muscle is employed to study the causal relations between age-associated microstructural changes and age-related force loss using Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM). The employed RKPM offers an effective means for modeling biological materials based on pixel points in the medical images and allow modeling of smooth transition in the material properties across interfaces. The proposed microstructure-informed muscle model enables quantitative evaluation on how cellular-scale compositions contribute to muscle functionality and explain differences in age-related force changes during concentric, isometric and eccentric contractions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The project design features multiple experimental replicates collected by three different laboratories. Our initial effort employed fully manual survival assays. With an interest in increasing throughput, we explored automation with flatbed scanner-based Automated Lifespan Machines (ALMs). We used ALMs to measure survivorship of 22 Caenorhabditis strains spanning three species. Additionally, we tested five chemicals that we previously found extended lifespan in manual assays. Overall, we found similar sources of variation among trials for the ALM and our previous manual assays, verifying reproducibility of outcome. Survival assessment was generally consistent between the manual and the ALM assays, although we did observe radically contrasting results for certain compound interventions. We found that particular lifespan outcome differences could be attributed to protocol elements such as enhanced light exposure of specific compounds in the ALM, underscoring that differences in technical details can influence outcomes and therefore interpretation. Overall, we demonstrate that the ALMs effectively reproduce a large, conventionally scored dataset from a diverse test set, independently validating ALMs as a robust and reproducible approach toward aging-intervention screening.</AbstractText>"}

The LTS continuously collected data from twins through 2000 after which the study closed indefinitely due to lack of funding. Now that the majority of the sample is age 40 or older (61.36%, N = 1770), the LTS childhood data can be linked to midlife cognitive functioning, among other physical, biological, social, and psychiatric outcomes. We report results from two pilot studies in anticipation of beginning the midlife phase of the LTS. The first pilot study was a participant tracking study, in which we showed that approximately 90% of the Louisville families randomly sampled (N = 203) for the study could be found. The second pilot study consisted of 40 in-person interviews in which twins completed cognitive, memory, biometric, and functional ability measures. The main purpose of the second study was to correlate midlife measures of cognitive functioning to a measure of biological age, which is an alternative index to chronological age that quantifies age as a function of the breakdown of structural and functional physiological systems, and then to relate both of these measures to twins' cognitive developmental trajectories. Midlife IQ was uncorrelated with biological age (- .01) while better scores on episodic memory more strongly correlated with lower biological age (- .19 to - .31). As expected, midlife IQ positively correlated with IQ measures collected throughout childhood and adolescence. Additionally, positive linear rates of change in FSIQ scores in childhood significantly correlated with biological age (- .68), physical functioning (.71), and functional ability (- .55), suggesting that cognitive development predicts lower biological age, better physical functioning, and better functional ability. In sum, the Louisville twins can be relocated to investigate whether and how early and midlife cognitive and physical health factors contribute to cognitive aging.</AbstractText>"}

Also, especially in men, androgen has beneficial effects on bone independent of estrogen. However, estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women increases the risk of developing breast cancer and endometrial cancer, and androgen replacement therapy for partial androgen deficiency of the aging male increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. Various mechanisms have been proposed on the effects of gonadal hormones on bone, such as effects through cytokines including IL-6 and effects on the OPG/RANKL ratio. In addition, large amounts of new information deriving from high-throughput gene expression analysis raise the possibility of multiple other effects on bone cells. Both estrogen and androgen exert their effects via the estrogen receptor (ER) or the androgen receptor (AR), which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Compounds such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) also bind ER and AR, respectively. However, SERMs and SARMs alter the ER or AR structure differently from estrogen or androgen, resulting in other downstream gene responses. As a result they can exert favorable effects on bone while suppressing the undesirable actions of estrogen and androgen. Elucidation of ER and AR ligand-specific and tissue-specific gene regulation mechanisms will also provide information on the signal transduction mechanisms of other nuclear receptors and will be valuable for the development of new therapeutic agents.</AbstractText>"}

Paediatric and adult practice varies around the world depending on geography, transplant allocation schemes and different emphases on living (versus deceased) donor renal transplantation. Internationally, paediatric patients often have priority in allocation schemes and younger donors are preferentially allocated to paediatric recipients. HLA matching can be difficult and may result in longer waiting times. Additionally, with improved surgical techniques and modern immunosuppressive regimens, how important is the contribution of HLA matching to graft longevity? In this review, we discuss the relative importance of HLA matching compared with donor quality; and long-term patient outcomes including re-transplantation rates. We share empirical evidence that will be useful for clinicians and families to make decisions about best donor options. We discuss why living donation still provides the best allograft survival outcomes and what to do in the scenario of a highly mismatched living donor.</AbstractText>"}

This double face is evident in the embryonic epidermis of zebrafish loss-of-function mutants in the cognate Matriptase inhibitor Hai1a (Spint1a). Mutant embryos display epidermal hyperplasia, but also apical cell extrusions, during which extruding outer keratinocytes carry out an entosis-like engulfment and entrainment of underlying basal cells, constituting a tumor-suppressive effect. These counteracting Matriptase effects depend on EGFR and the newly identified mediator phospholipase D (PLD), which promotes both mTORC1-dependent cell proliferation and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-dependent entosis and apical cell extrusion. Accordingly, hypomorphic hai1a mutants heal spontaneously, while otherwise lethal hai1a amorphs are efficiently rescued upon cotreatment with PLD inhibitors and S1P. Together, our data elucidate the mechanisms underlying the double face of Matriptase function in vivo and reveal the potential use of combinatorial carcinoma treatments when such double-face mechanisms are involved.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Armistead et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Most of the strategies employed for the control of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) involve synthetic chemicals. The indiscriminate use of synthetic chemicals has led to the development of resistance and is unsafe for human and environmental health. Therefore, there is a need to develop ecologically safe tactics, such as the use of the entomopathogenic fungus (EPF) Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff 1879) (Met-11.1). The following study investigated the effectiveness of EPF-Met-11.1 on different demographic parameters of Ae. albopictus. Mortality bioassays showed 92.5% mortality when adult Ae. albopictus were treated with M. anisopliae. Metarhizium anisopliae absorbs the hemolymph sugar which results in retarded development. Metarhizium anisopliae LC50 not only affected the parental generation (F0) but also affected the demographic parameters of the offspring (F1). Transgenerational results (F1) with Met-11.1 showed decreased net reproductive rates (Ro), intrinsic rates of increase (r), and mean generation times (T) compared to those of uninfected controls. The larval developmental duration in the treatment group was 8.22 d, compared to 8.00 d in the control. There was a significant decrease in mean fecundity in the treated group (208.87 eggs) compared to that of the control group (360.27 eggs), and adult longevity was also significantly reduced in the treated group. Therefore, it is concluded that M. anisopliae can have lasting effects on the developmental parameters of Ae. albopictus, indicating that it can be an integral part of mosquito control strategies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Advances in these models include the ability to skew differentiation to particular lineages, providing a useful tool to study cell type specific function/dysfunction in the context of the epithelium. Here, we use comprehensive profiling of mRNA, microRNA and long non-coding RNA expression to confirm that Paneth cell and goblet cell enrichment of murine small intestinal organoids (enteroids) establishes a physiologically accurate model. We employ network analysis to infer the regulatory landscape altered by skewing differentiation, and using knowledge of cell type specific markers, we predict key regulators of cell type specific functions: Cebpa, Jun, Nr1d1 and Rxra specific to Paneth cells, Gfi1b and Myc specific for goblet cells and Ets1, Nr3c1 and Vdr shared between them. Links identified between these regulators and cellular phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that global regulatory rewiring during or after differentiation of Paneth cells and goblet cells could contribute to IBD aetiology. Future application of cell type enriched enteroids combined with the presented computational workflow can be used to disentangle multifactorial mechanisms of these cell types and propose regulators whose pharmacological targeting could be advantageous in treating IBD patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.</AbstractText>"}

Identification of endogenous inflammasome activators is essential for the development of new anti-inflammatory treatment strategies. Here, we identified that apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in human monocytes by inducing an alternative NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-8 and dimerization of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Alternative inflammasome activation in human monocytes is mediated by the Toll-like receptor adapter protein SCIMP. This triggers Lyn/Syk-dependent calcium entry and the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to activation of caspase-8. In humanized mouse models, ApoC3 activated human monocytes in vivo to impede endothelial regeneration and promote kidney injury in an NLRP3- and caspase-8-dependent manner. These data provide new insights into the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the pathophysiological role of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins containing ApoC3. Targeting ApoC3 might prevent organ damage and provide an anti-inflammatory treatment for vascular and kidney diseases.</AbstractText>"}

However, the function of lncRNAs in cellular senescence remains largely unknown. Here we identify a novel long intergenic noncoding RNA Linc-ASEN expresses in prematurely senescent cells. We find that Linc-ASEN associates with UPF1 by RNA pulldown mass spectrometry analysis, and represses cellular senescence by reducing p21 production transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. Mechanistically, the Linc-ASEN-UPF1 complex suppressed p21 transcription by recruiting Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 to the p21 locus, and thereby preventing binding of the transcriptional activator p53 on the p21 promoter through histone modification. In addition, the Linc-ASEN-UPF1 complex repressed p21 expression posttranscriptionally by enhancing p21 mRNA decay in association with DCP1A. Accordingly, Linc-ASEN levels were found to correlate inversely with p21 mRNA levels in tumors from patient-derived mouse xenograft, in various human cancer tissues, and in aged mice tissues.

Aged rats received subcutaneous injections of TP (2 mg/kg/d, 84 days). Oxidative stress parameters and the expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b), Kelch-like ECH associating protein-1 (Keap1), Nrf2, haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) in liver tissues were examined to check whether the Nrf2-ARE pathway was involved in the age-related changes in liver. Our results showed that TP supplementation alleviated liver morphology, liver function and liver fibrosis; improved oxidative stress parameters; and increased the expression of STAT5b, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 and decreased the expression of Keap1 in the liver tissues of aged rats. These results suggested that TP increased the expression of STAT5b, and then activated the Nrf2-ARE pathway and promoted antioxidant mechanisms in aged rats. These findings may provide new therapeutic uses for TP in patients with age-related liver changes.</AbstractText>"}

However, CRISPR/Cas-based strategies designed to precisely edit the genome can often yield unintended outcomes. Here, we report the use of zygotic CRISPR/Cas9 injections to generate a knock-in GFP reporter mouse at the Gdf11 locus. Phenotypic and genomic characterization of founder animals from these injections revealed a subset that contained the correct targeting event and exhibited GFP expression that, within the hematopoietic system, was restricted predominantly to lymphoid cells. Yet, in another subset of founder mice, we detected aberrant integration events at the target site that dramatically and inaccurately shifted hematopoietic GFP expression from the lymphoid to the myeloid lineage. Additionally, we recovered multiple Gdf11 deletion alleles that modified the C-terminus of the GDF11 protein. When bred to homozygosity, most of these alleles recapitulated skeletal phenotypes reported previously for Gdf11 knockout mice, suggesting that these represent null alleles. However, we also recovered one Gdf11 deletion allele that encodes a novel GDF11 variant protein ('GDF11-WE') predicted to contain two additional amino acids (tryptophan (W) and glutamic acid (E)) at the C-terminus of the mature ligand. Unlike the other Gdf11 deletion alleles recovered in this study, homozygosity for the Gdf11<sup>WE</sup> allele did not phenocopy Gdf11 knockout skeletal phenotypes. Further investigation using in vivo and in vitro approaches demonstrated that GDF11-WE retains substantial physiological function, indicating that GDF11 can tolerate at least some modifications of its C-terminus and providing unexpected insights into its biochemical activities. Altogether, our study confirms that one-step zygotic injections of CRISPR/Cas gene editing complexes provide a quick and powerful tool to generate gene-modified mouse models. Moreover, our findings underscore the critical importance of thorough characterization and validation of any modified alleles generated by CRISPR, as unintended on-target effects that fail to be detected by simple PCR screening can produce substantially altered phenotypic readouts.</AbstractText>"}

Cdc7 is expressed at a high level and exhibits significant kinase activity not only during S-phase but also during G2/M-phases. A conserved mitotic kinase, Aurora B, is activated during M-phase by association with INCENP, forming the chromosome passenger complex with Borealin and Survivin. We show that Cdc7 phosphorylates and stimulates Aurora B kinase activity in vitro. We identified threonine-236 as a critical phosphorylation site on Aurora B that could be a target of Cdc7 or could be an autophosphorylation site stimulated by Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation elsewhere. We found that threonines at both 232 (that has been identified as an autophosphorylation site) and 236 are essential for the kinase activity of Aurora B. Cdc7 down regulation or inhibition reduced Aurora B activity in vivo and led to retarded M-phase progression. SAC imposed by paclitaxel was dramatically reversed by Cdc7 inhibition, similar to the effect of Aurora B inhibition under the similar situation. Our data show that Cdc7 contributes to M-phase progression and to spindle assembly checkpoint most likely through Aurora B activation.</AbstractText>"}

However, the mechanism by which the breast cancer cells are resistant to PAX remains unclear. Here, we identified a circular RNA of angiomotin-like 1 (circAMOTL1) as an important player which may be responsible for the adverse resistance against PAX in breast cancer cells. The circAMOTL1 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells via transfection of circAMOTL1 construct. Overexpression of circAMOTL1 caused significant increase of cell viability, reduction of apoptosis, and enhancement of invasion when MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to PAX compared to those cells with vector control. Moreover, these resistant effects could be blocked by the application of circAMOTL1 siRNA. In these circAMOTL1 overexpressing cells, we found notable increase of both phosphorylated and total AKT protein, which suggested that AKT might be the downstream factor mediating the resistant effects. Consequently, the gene and protein expression of AKT related pro-apoptotic (BAX and BAK) and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2) factors were significantly changed by circAMOTL1 as well. These results suggest circAMOTL1 may play an important role in the PAX resistance of breast cancer cells via regulation of AKT pathway, facilitation of anti-apoptotic protein and inhibition of pro-apoptotic protein. While providing a new mechanism of PAX resistance in breast cancer cells, our findings may lay groundwork for a novel therapeutic target of the breast cancer treatment in the future.</AbstractText>"}

In this study, we examined the function of mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the pathogenesis of AD. Compared to AppPs1 mice, Sirt3-haploinsufficient AppPs1 mice (Sirt3<sup>+/-</sup>AppPs1) exhibit early epileptiform EEG activity and Seizure. Both male and female Sirt3<sup>+/-</sup>AppPs1 mice were observed to die prematurely before five months of age. When comparing male mice among different genotypes, Sirt3 haploinsufficiency renders GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex vulnerable to degeneration and associated neuronal network hyperexcitability. Feeding Sirt3<sup>+/-</sup>AppPs1 AD mice with a ketone ester-rich diet increases SIRT3 expression and prevents seizure-related death and the degeneration of GABAergic neurons, indicating that the aggravated GABAergic neuron loss and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Sirt3<sup>+/-</sup>AppPs1 mice are caused by SIRT3 reduction and can be rescued by increase of SIRT3 expression. Consistent with a protective role in AD, SIRT3 levels are reduced in association with cerebral cortical Aβ pathology in AD patients. In summary, SIRT3 preserves GABAergic interneurons and protects cerebral circuits against hyperexcitability, and this neuroprotective mechanism can be bolstered by dietary ketone esters.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>GABAergic neurons provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. By preserving mitochondrial function, SIRT3 protects parvalbumin and calretinin interneurons against Aβ-associated dysfunction and degeneration in AppPs1 AD mice, thus restraining neuronal network hyperactivity. The neuronal network dysfunction that occurs in AD can be partially reversed by physiological, dietary, and pharmacological interventions to increase SIRT3 expression and enhance the functionality of GABAergic interneurons.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We had no information on indoor air quality or personal exposures; our risk estimates should thus be regarded as characterizing the counties of residence rather than individual exposures of inhabitants. In addition to age, the strongest predictors of veterans' survival were residence in high-poverty zip-codes, smoking, and diastolic blood pressure, to all of which black veterans were less sensitive than whites. Black veterans had significantly lower mortality risks from aging, smoking, and elevated diastolic blood pressure, but larger risks from excessive body-mass index. They were less at risk from living a high-poverty zip-code than whites. We assumed these risk factors to be stable during follow-up and thus applicable to chronic health effects. After controlling for them, the all-cause mortality risk for black veterans was 10% lower than whites. In an effort to reduce random scatter we computed mean risks associated with overlapping groups of similar pollutants. These means were statistically significant for both black and white veterans for traffic-related, gaseous, and NO<sub>x</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> pollutants, for which the overall mean relative risk was 1.076 (1.057-1.090). Grouped mean risks for particulate pollutants, sulfur compounds, and non-traffic pollutants were not significant for either race. Black veterans carried more of the traffic-related risks than whites because of their greater exposures and risk coefficients. PM<sub>2.5</sub> risk estimates were negative for black veterans (0.82 [0.75-0.89]) but positive for whites (1.05 [1.005-1.10]) which is consistent with regional differences in overall mortality. The temporal analyses compared mortality rates by follow-up subperiod for the pollutants measured at enrollment. We expected increasing (cumulative) risks for chronic effects and decreasing risks for delayed acute effects, but found no significant trend for either race. We concluded that the higher exposures and mortality risks associated with vehicular traffic posed environmental injustice for the black veterans.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Frequency of flare-ups, development of complications, and response to treatment collectively determine the effect on a patient's quality of life, which can vary from minimal disruption to profound disability or death. Despite recent advances in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis, including for Crohn's disease, management decisions are still typically made using a one-size-fits-all approach. Indeed, the inability to reliably predict clinical outcomes in a way that could guide future therapy represents a major unmet need. Recently, several important insights have been made into the biology underlying outcomes in Crohn's disease. In this Review, we will summarise these insights and discuss how greater understanding of these disease mechanisms can be used to develop clinically useful biomarkers, identify novel approaches to optimise disease control, and help deliver the goal of personalised medicine.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, primary age-related tauopathy (PART) has been described as a new anatomopathological disorder where NFTs are the main feature in the absence of neuritic plaques. However, since PART has mainly been studied in post-mortem patient brains, not much is known about the clinical or neuroimaging characteristics of PART. Here, we studied the clinical brain imaging characteristics of PART focusing on neuroanatomical vulnerability by applying a previously validated multiregion visual atrophy scale. We analysed 26 cases with confirmed PART with paired clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. In this selected cohort we found that upon correcting for the effect of age, there is increased atrophy in the medial temporal region with increasing Braak staging (r = 0.3937, p = 0.0466). Upon controlling for Braak staging effect, predominantly two regions, anterior temporal (r = 0.3638, p = 0.0677) and medial temporal (r = 0.3836, p = 0.053), show a trend for increased atrophy with increasing age. Moreover, anterior temporal lobe atrophy was associated with decreased semantic memory/language (r = - 0.5823, p = 0.0056; and r = - 0.6371, p = 0.0019, respectively), as was medial temporal lobe atrophy (r = - 0.4445, p = 0.0435). Overall, these findings support that PART is associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy and predominantly affects semantic memory/language. These findings highlight that other factors associated with aging and beyond NFTs could be involved in PART pathophysiology.</AbstractText>"}

Due to the increase in population and longevity, incidence will triple by the middle of the twenty-first century. So far, no treatment has prevented or reversed the disease. More than 20 years of multidisciplinary studies have shown that brain zinc dyshomeostasis may play a critical role in AD progression, which provides encouraging clues for metal-targeted therapies in the treatment of AD. Unfortunately, the pilot clinical application of zinc chelator and/or ionophore strategy, such as the use of quinoline-based compounds, namely clioquinol and PBT2, has not yet been successful. The emerging findings revealed a list of key zinc transporters whose mRNA or protein levels were abnormally altered at different stages of AD brains. Furthermore, specifically modulating the expression of some of the zinc transporters in the central nervous system through genetic methods slowed down or prevented AD progression in animal models, resulting in significantly improved cognitive performance, movement, and prolonged lifespan. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it shed new light on the treatment or prevention of the disease. This review considers recent advances regarding AD, zinc and zinc transporters, recapitulating their relationships in extending our current understanding of the disease amelioration effects of zinc transport proteins as potential therapeutic targets to cure AD, and it may also provide new insights to identify novel therapeutic strategies for ageing and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Methods- Stroke survivors and their family caregivers (205 dyads) were enrolled from the national REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) into the CARES study (Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke) ≈9 months after a first-time ischemic stroke. Demographically matched stroke-free dyads (N=205) were also enrolled. Participants were interviewed by telephone, and depressive symptoms were assessed with the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Results- Significant elevations in depressive symptoms (<i>Ps</i>&lt;0.03) were observed for stroke survivors (M=8.38) and for their family caregivers (M=6.42) relative to their matched controls (Ms=5.18 and 4.62, respectively). Stroke survivors reported more symptoms of depression than their caregivers (<i>P</i>=0.008). No race or sex differences were found, but differential prediction of depressive symptom levels was found across patients and caregivers. Younger age and having an older caregiver were associated with more depressive symptoms in stroke survivors while being a spouse caregiver and reporting fewer positive aspects of caregiving were associated with more depressive symptoms in caregivers. The percentage of caregivers at risk for clinically significant depression was lower in this population-based sample (12%) than in previous studies of caregivers from convenience or clinical samples. Conclusions- High depressive symptom levels are common 9 months after first-time ischemic strokes for stroke survivors and family caregivers, but rates of depressive symptoms at risk for clinical depression were lower for caregivers than previously reported. Predictors of depression differ for patients and caregivers, and standards of care should incorporate family caregiving factors.</AbstractText>"}

However, the role of these cells and B lymphocytes in the human PvAT adjacent to unstable atherosclerotic plaques has not been investigated. Moreover, previous studies were inconclusive on whether PvAT inflammation was restricted to the surroundings of the atheroma plaque. Methods and Results Coronary arteries were freshly dissected with the surrounding PvAT. Atherosclerotic plaques were classified according to the internationally accepted anatomopathological criteria. Immune cells in the PvAT were detected using immunohistochemistry and then quantified. We used linear and logistic regressions with robust standard errors, adjusted for possible confounding factors. In 246 atherosclerotic plaques (205 stable and 41 unstable plaques) from 82 participants (mean age=69.0±14.4 years; 50% men), the percentage of arterial obstruction was positively correlated with the densities of CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<i>P</i>=0.003) and CD20<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes (<i>P</i>=0.03) in the periplaque PvAT. The number of cells was greater in the periplaque PvAT than in the distal PvAT (macrophages, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001; B lymphocytes, <i>P</i>=0.04).

Yet whether aging increases the risk of atherosclerosis independently of chronic hyperlipidemia is not known.<b>Objective:</b> To determine if vascular aging prior to the induction of hyperlipidemia enhances atherogenesis. <b>Methods and Results:</b> We analyzed the aortas of young and aged normolipidemic wild type (WT), disease free mice and found that aging led to elevated IL-6 levels and mitochondrial dysfunction, associated with increased mitophagy and the associated protein Parkin. In aortic tissue culture, we found evidence that with aging mitochondrial dysfunction and IL-6 exist in a positive feedback loop. We triggered acute hyperlipidemia in aged and young mice by inducing liver-specific degradation of the LDL receptor combined with a 10-week western diet and found that atherogenesis was enhanced in aged WT mice. Hyperlipidemia further reduced mitochondrial function and increased the levels of Parkin in the aortas of aged mice but not young mice. Genetic disruption of autophagy in smooth muscle cells of young mice exposed to hyperlipidemia led to increased aortic Parkin and IL-6 levels, impaired mitochondrial function, and enhanced atherogenesis. Importantly, enhancing mitophagy in aged, hyperlipidemic mice via oral administration of spermidine prevented the increase in aortic IL-6 and Parkin, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced atherogenesis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Prior to hyperlipidemia, aging elevates IL-6 and impairs mitochondrial function within the aorta, associated with enhanced mitophagy and increased Parkin levels. These age-associated changes prime the vasculature to exacerbate atherogenesis upon acute hyperlipidemia. Our work implies that novel therapeutics aimed at improving vascular mitochondrial bioenergetics or reducing inflammation before hyperlipidemia may reduce age-related atherosclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

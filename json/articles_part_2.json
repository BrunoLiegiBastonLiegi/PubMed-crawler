During cancer progression, EMT is found to be associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. In this review, we focus on the discussion of recent studies about the regulation of EMT by cigarette smoking. Various groups of active compounds found in cigarette smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), and reactive oxygen specicies (ROS) can induce EMT through different signaling pathways. The links between EMT and biological responses to cigarette smoke, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative damages, are also discussed. The effect of cigarette smoke on EMT is not only limited to cancer types directly related to smoking, such as lung cancer, but has also been found in other types of cancer. Altogether, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms of the induction of EMT by cigarette smoking and will help in identifying novel small molecules for targeting EMT induced by smoking. </AbstractText>"}

This is tragically inopportune as alcohol and tobacco have an established 'synergistic' effect on aerodigestive cancer risk. Moreover, even when patients successfully tackle their alcohol problems they remain at increased risk for developing these cancers, especially if they continue to smoke. A case series is presented together with a discussion on how service provision for co-misuse could be improved to obviate aerodigestive cancer risk.

Previous studies show that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) possess promising anti-inflammatory properties, therefore stabilization of EETs and other fatty acid epoxides through inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was investigated in mouse models of acute and sub-chronic inflammation caused by TS exposure. During the entire TS exposure, the potent sEH inhibitor 1-(1-methylsulfonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-urea (TUPS) was given via drinking water. To assess drug target engagement of TUPS, a tandem mass spectrometry method was used for bioactive lipid profiling of a broad range of fatty acid metabolites, including EETs, and their corresponding diols (DHETs) derived from arachidonic acid, as well as epoxides and diols derived from other fatty acids. Several, but not all, plasma epoxide/diol ratios increased in mice treated with sEH inhibitor, compared to non-treated mice suggesting a wider role for sEH involving more fatty acid precursors besides arachidonic acid. This study supports qualitative use of epoxide/diol ratios explored by bioactive lipid profiling to indicate drug target engagement in mouse models of TS exposure relevant to COPD, which may have ramifications for future therapeutic interventions of sEH.</AbstractText>"}

Flavonoids are plant polyphenolic compounds, studied extensively for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Q3G) is a flavonoid which is widely found in plants. Six novel long chain fatty acid [stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] derivatives of Q3G were evaluated for their potential in protecting human lung fibroblasts against cytotoxicity induced by selected cigarette smoke toxicants: 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone (NNK), benzo-α-pyrene (BaP), nicotine and chromium (Cr[VI]). Nicotine and Cr[VI] induced toxicity in fibroblasts and reduced the percentage of viable cells, while BaP and NNK did not affect cell viability. The fatty acid derivatives of Q3G provided protection against nicotine- and Cr[VI]-induced cell death and membrane lipid peroxidation. Based on the evaluation of inflammatory markers of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the fatty acid derivatives of Q3G were found to be effective in lowering the inflammatory response. Overall, these novel fatty acid esters of Q3G warrant further investigation as potential cytoprotective agents. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

BD levels in mainstream smoke (MSS) from international and Canadian cigarettes and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) were derived from scientific journals and international government reports. Dose-response analyses from toxicity studies from government reports were evaluated and the most sensitive cancer and noncancer endpoints were selected. The risks were evaluated by taking the ratio (margin of exposure, MOE) from the most sensitive toxicity endpoint and appropriate exposure estimates for BD in MSS and ETS. BD is a good choice for lowering given that MSS and ETS were at levels for cancer (leukemia) and noncancer (ovarian atrophy) risks, and the risks can be significantly lowered when lowering the BD concentrations in smoke. Several risk reduction strategies were analyzed including a maximum level of 125% of the median BD value per milligram nicotine obtained from international brands as recommended by the WHO TobReg, tobacco substitute sheets, dual and triple carbon filters, and polymer-derived carbon. The use of tobacco substitute sheet with a polymer-derived carbon filter resulted in the most significant change in risk for cancer and noncancer effects. Our results demonstrate that MOE analysis might be a practical way to assess the impact of risk reduction strategies on human health in the future. </AbstractText>"}

In a multivariable analysis, menthol use was associated with being younger, female and of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity. Among all adolescents, the percentage who smoked non-menthol cigarettes decreased from 2004-2010, while menthol smoking rates remained constant; among all young adults, the percentage who smoked non-menthol cigarettes also declined, while menthol smoking rates increased.

Although low levels of ROS can be beneficial, excessive accumulation can promote cancer. One characteristic of cancer cells that distinguishes them from normal cells is their ability to produce increased numbers of ROS and their increased dependence on an antioxidant defense system. ROS are produced as a byproduct intracellularly by mitochondria and other cellular elements and exogenously by pollutants, tobacco, smoke, drugs, xenobiotics, and radiation. ROS modulate various cell signaling pathways, which are primarily mediated through the transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, kinases, growth factors, cytokines and other proteins, and enzymes; these pathways have been linked to cellular transformation, inflammation, tumor survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer. ROS are also associated with epigenetic changes in genes, which is helpful in diagnosing diseases. This review considers the role of ROS in the various stages of cancer development. Finally, we provide evidence that nutraceuticals derived from Mother Nature are highly effective in eliminating cancer cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Lung cancer that develops in the absence of significant tobacco-smoke exposure appears to be a unique disease entity with novel genomic and epigenomic alterations and activation of molecular pathways that are not generally seen in tobacco-smoke-induced lung cancer. These molecular alterations are very likely responsible for the unique clinico-pathological features of lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS), and some of these molecular alterations - such as the activating EGFR TK mutations and EML4-ALK fusion - significantly influence therapeutic choices and treatment outcomes.

The lungs are exposed daily to oxidants generated either endogenously or exogenously (air pollutants, cigarette smoke, etc.). Cells in aerobic organisms are protected against oxidative damage by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Recent epidemiologic investigations have shown associations between increased incidence of respiratory diseases and lung cancer from exposure to low levels of various forms of respirable fibers and particulate matter (PM), at occupational or urban air polluting environments. Lung cancer increases substantially for tobacco smokers due to the synergistic effects in the generation of ROS, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation with high DNA damage potential. Physical and chemical characteristics of particles (size, transition metal content, speciation, stable free radicals, etc.) play an important role in oxidative stress. In turn, oxidative stress initiates the synthesis of mediators of pulmonary inflammation in lung epithelial cells and initiation of carcinogenic mechanisms. Inhalable quartz, metal powders, mineral asbestos fibers, ozone, soot from gasoline and diesel engines, tobacco smoke and PM from ambient air pollution (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅) are involved in various oxidative stress mechanisms. Pulmonary cancer initiation and promotion has been linked to a series of biochemical pathways of oxidative stress, DNA oxidative damage, macrophage stimulation, telomere shortening, modulation of gene expression and activation of transcription factors with important role in carcinogenesis. In this review we are presenting the role of ROS and oxidative stress in the production of mediators of pulmonary inflammation and mechanisms of carcinogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

PM induces oxidative stress via production of reactive oxygen species and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-8. In addition, the increased production of ROS such as superoxide and hydroxyl radical by PM exposure increases MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, resulting in the degradation of collagen. These processes lead to the increased inflammatory skin diseases and skin aging. In addition, environmental cigarette smoke, which is well known as an oxidizing agent, is closely related with androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Also, ultrafine particles (UFPs) including black carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enhance the incidence of skin cancer. Overall, increased PM levels are highly associated with the development of various skin diseases via the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs may be useful for treating PM-induced skin diseases. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Under homeostatic conditions, mutant macrophages accumulate undigested lysosomal material, which disrupts endocytic recycling and impairs their migration to, and thus engulfment of, dying cells. This causes a buildup of unengulfed cell debris. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages with lysosomal storage cannot migrate toward infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis in the tuberculous granuloma. The unengulfed apoptotic macrophages undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and increased mycobacterial growth. Macrophage lysosomal storage similarly impairs migration to newly infecting mycobacteria. This phenotype is recapitulated in human smokers, who are at increased risk for tuberculosis. A majority of their alveolar macrophages exhibit lysosomal accumulations of tobacco smoke particulates and do not migrate to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The incapacitation of highly microbicidal first-responding macrophages may contribute to smokers' susceptibility to tuberculosis. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may lead to direct activation of the insulin receptors on tumor cells and promote tumor growth. Other potential mechanisms include increased circulating, local or bioavailable insulin-like growth factor 1, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, increased circulating or local estrogen, adipokines and direct and indirect effects of inflammatory cytokines.

TrxR is a selenoenzyme with a selenocysteine (Sec) residue exposed on the enzyme's surface. This unique Sec residue is particularly susceptible to modification by numerous types of electrophiles, leading to inactivation of TrxR and consequent cytotoxicity. Cigarette smoke contains various electrophiles, and the present study showed that CSE could inhibit intracellular TrxR through causing crosslinking and alkylation of TrxR1. TrxR inhibitory capacities of various CSEs were evaluated by using mouse-liver homogenate. Among the CSEs prepared from 18 commercial cigarette brands, TrxR inhibitory capacities of the maximum and the minimum had a 2.5-fold difference. Importantly, CSE's inhibitory capacity greatly paralleled its cytotoxic potency in all cell lines used. Compared to cytotoxic assays, which have been widely used for evaluating cigarette toxicity but are not suitable for simultaneously examining a large number of cigarette samples, the present method was simple and rapid with a high-throughput feature and thus could be used as an auxiliary means to predict the cytotoxicity of a large number of cigarette samples, making it possible to extensively screen numerous agricultural and industrial measures that potentially affect cigarette safety. </AbstractText>"}

In the present studies, we demonstrated that the overexpression of mdig in A549 adenocarcinomic human alveolar type II epithelial cells decreases the heterochromatin conformation of the cells and de-represses the transcription of genes in the tandemly repeated DNA regions. Although mdig can only cause a marginal decrease of the total histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), a significant reduction of H3K9me3 in the promoter region of H19, the paternally imprinted but maternally expressed gene transcribing a large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA), was observed in the cells with mdig overexpression. Silencing mdig by either shRNA or siRNA not only increased the level of H3K9me3 in the promoter region of H19 but also attenuated the transcription of H19 long non-coding RNA. Demethylation assays using immunoprecipitated mdig and histone H3 peptide substrate suggested that mdig is able to remove the methyl groups from H3K9me3. Clinically, we found that higher levels of mdig and H19 expression correlate with poorer survival of the lung cancer patients. Taken together, our results imply that mdig is involved in the regulation of H3K9me3 to influence the heterochromatin structure of the genome and the expression of genes important for cell growth or transformation. </AbstractText>"}

Compared to those in the general population, they smoke more, die younger, and suffer disproportionately from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer, all diseases and conditions directly associated with, and exacerbated by, smoking. Despite strong evidence that tobacco cessation counseling by a health professional can approximately double patients' odds of quitting, clinicians across disciplines are reluctant to offer these individuals effective means by which to quit smoking. This disinclination is due, at least in part, to inadequate tobacco cessation training during degree education. The purpose of this qualitative study was to assess undergraduate nursing students' perceptions of a tobacco education intervention. Findings support the integration of tobacco education into undergraduate nursing curricula. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recent reports have demonstrated that NNK exposure may be associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance in certain cancers. However, the underlying NNK-induced mechanism contributing to the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we used HT29 cells treated with NNK to simulate the long-term exposure of cigarette smoke. A comparative analysis was performed to evaluate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and drug-resistance genes expression, cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, and anti-apoptotic activity. Signaling pathways related to chemoresistance were also investigated. As a result, NNK exposure dose-dependently stimulates cell proliferation, enhance abilities of migration and invasion, induce EMT phenomenon, and attenuate apoptosis. Furthermore, NNK exposure also promotes the capabilities of sphere formation, upregulation of Snail, and overexpression of CD133, Nanog, OCT4, and the drug-resistant genes. Knockdown of Snail results in upregulation of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), increased apoptosis, reversal of EMT phenomenon, and reducation of expression of CSC markers, all of which contribute to a decrease of chemoresistance. Our study demonstrates a number of related mechanisms that mediate the effect of NNK exposure on increasing CRC therapeutic resistance via the Snail signaling pathway. Targeting Snail may provide a feasible strategy for the treatment of CRC. </AbstractText>"}

In all vertebrates, they are composed of TTAGGG repeats coated with specific protecting proteins. Telomeres shorten with each mitotic cell division, but telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, elongate telomeres in very specific cells, such as embryonic and adult stem cells. Although telomere sequence is identical in mice and humans and telomeres serve the same role of protecting chromosomes and genetic information from damage and erosion in both species, abnormalities in telomere maintenance and in telomerase function do not coincide in phenotype in humans and mice. The telomeres of most laboratory mice are 5 to 10 times longer than in humans, but their lifespan is 30 times shorter. Complete absence of telomerase has little expression in phenotype over several generations in mice, whereas heterozygosity for telomerase mutations in humans is sufficient to result in organ regeneration defect and cancer development. Patients with telomerase deficiency and very short telomeres may develop aplastic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, or cirrhosis, whereas telomerase-null murine models display only modest hematopoietic deficiency and develop emphysema when exposed to cigarette smoke. In summary, telomerase deficiency in both humans and mice accelerate telomere shortening, but its consequences in the different organs and in the organism diverge, mainly due to telomere length differences.</AbstractText>"}

It is also present in cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust, and urban air, leading to widespread exposure of human populations. Upon entering the body, BD is metabolized to electrophilic epoxides, 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EB), diepoxybutane (DEB), and 3,4-epoxy-1,2-diol (EBD), which can alkylate DNA nucleobases. The most abundant BD epoxide, EBD, modifies the N7-guanine positions in DNA to form N7-(2, 3, 4-trihydroxybut-1-yl) guanine (N7-THBG) adducts, which can be useful as biomarkers of BD exposure and metabolic activation to DNA-reactive epoxides. In the present work, a capillary HPLC-high resolution ESI⁺-MS/MS (HPLC-ESI⁺-HRMS/MS) methodology was developed for accurate, sensitive, and reproducible quantification of N7-THBG in cell culture and in human white blood cells. In our approach, DNA is subjected to neutral thermal hydrolysis to release N7-guanine adducts from the DNA backbone, followed by ultrafiltration, solid-phase extraction, and isotope dilution HPLC-ESI⁺-HRMS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Following method validation, N7-THBG was quantified in human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells treated with micromolar concentrations of DEB and in DNA isolated from blood of smokers, nonsmokers, individuals participating in a smoking cessation program, and occupationally exposed workers. N7-THBG concentrations increased linearly from 31.4 ± 4.84 to 966.55 ± 128.05 adducts per 10⁹ nucleotides in HT1080 cells treated with 1-100 μM DEB. N7-THBG amounts in leukocyte DNA of nonsmokers, smokers, and occupationally exposed workers were 7.08 ± 5.29, 8.20 ± 5.12, and 9.72 ± 3.80 adducts per 10⁹ nucleotides, respectively, suggesting the presence of an endogenous or environmental source for this adduct. The availability of sensitive HPLC-ESI⁺-HRMS/MS methodology for BD-induced DNA adducts in humans will enable future population studies of interindividual and ethnic differences in BD bioactivation to DNA-reactive epoxides.</AbstractText>"}

While most sexually active people become infected, the majority with a healthy natural immunity control their infection. When the infection becomes persistent in cervical mucosa for instance, it is associated with nearly all cervical cancers. Fortunately cervical cancer screening is both sensitive and specific and when accessed has led to significant reductions of this disease. Despite this, cervical cancer still remains one of the leading causes of death from cancer. Oropharyngeal mucosa is becoming persistently infected with HPV in an increasing number of people leading to a potential epidemic of oropharyngeal carcinoma. While only 10% of new oropharyngeal infections persist, those in elderly men who smoke are more likely to do so. Some centres report more than 70% of oropharyngeal cancers are associated with HPV infection, which is different to cancers caused by alcohol and tobacco. Other centres report only a 20% association. Education against high-risk sexual behaviour has been met with limited success. Screening for oropharyngeal HPV infection has been disappointing with a pickup rate of only 40%. Some hope lies in detecting viral DNA in both the saliva and plasma. A HPV vaccine has been available since 2006 but is not yet routinely given to both sexes in many countries. Its effect on the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas is currently unknown. Vigilance by dental and medical colleagues in the meantime is essential. </AbstractText>"}

Solid-phase extraction on mixed mode reverse phase-anion exchange 96-well plates provided sufficient purification for LC-MS/MS analysis, which was performed by auto-injection using a 96-well format, and resulted in clean, readily interpretable chromatograms, with detection limits of 4.5pmol/mL urine for 3-HPMA and 3.5pmol/mL urine for HMPMA. Accuracy was 92% for 3-HPMA and 97% for HMPMA while inter-day precision was 9.1% (coefficient of variation) for 3-HPMA and 11.0% for HMPMA.

Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms by which continuous, long term exposure to tobacco smoke contributes to breast carcinogenesis because most previous studies have focused on short term treatment models. In this work we have set out to investigate the progressive transforming effects of tobacco smoke on non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells using in vitro and in vivo models of chronic cigarette smoke exposure.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>We show that both non-tumorigenic (MCF 10A, MCF-12A) and tumorigenic (MCF7) breast epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke acquire mesenchymal properties such as fibroblastoid morphology, increased anchorage-independent growth, and increased motility and invasiveness. Moreover, transplantation experiments in mice demonstrate that treatment with cigarette smoke extract renders MCF 10A cells more capable to survive and colonize the mammary ducts and MCF7 cells more prone to metastasize from a subcutaneous injection site, independent of cigarette smoke effects on the host and stromal environment. The extent of transformation and the resulting phenotype thus appear to be associated with the differentiation state of the cells at the time of exposure. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that treatment with CSE leads to the emergence of a CD44(hi)/CD24(low) population in MCF 10A cells and of CD44+ and CD49f + MCF7 cells, indicating that cigarette smoke causes the emergence of cell populations bearing markers of self-renewing stem-like cells.

The present study was aimed to prove that transgenic expression of human cytochrome P450 2A13 (CYP2A13), known to be selectively expressed in the respiratory tract and be the most efficient enzyme for NNK bioactivation in vitro, will enhance NNK bioactivation and NNK-induced tumorigenesis in the mouse lung. Kinetic parameters of NNK bioactivation in vitro and incidence of NNK-induced lung tumors in vivo were determined for wild-type, Cyp2a5-null and CYP2A13-humanized (CYP2A13-transgenic/Cyp2a5-null) mice. As expected, in both liver and lung microsomes, the loss of CYP2A5 resulted in significant increases in Michaelis constant (K m) values for the formation of 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanal, representing the reactive intermediate that can lead to the formation of O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)-mG) DNA adducts; however, the gain of CYP2A13 at a fraction of the level of mouse lung CYP2A5 led to recovery of the activity in the lung, but not in the liver. The levels of O(6)-mG, the DNA adduct highly correlated with lung tumorigenesis, were significantly higher in the lungs of CYP2A13-humanized mice than in Cyp2a5-null mice. Moreover, incidences of lung tumorigenesis were significantly greater in CYP2A13-humanized mice than in Cyp2a5-null mice, and the magnitude of the differences in incidence was greater at low (30mg/kg) than at high (200mg/kg) NNK doses. These results indicate that CYP2A13 is a low K m enzyme in catalyzing NNK bioactivation in vivo and support the notion that genetic polymorphisms of CYP2A13 can influence the risks of tobacco-induced lung tumorigenesis in humans. </AbstractText>"}

Such alloy is used for the fabrication of objects used for the personal protection of cancer patients subject to high energy treatment. The parameters taken into consideration for this study were sex, age and smoking habits. In the test subject's working cycle reported in our case, there were traces of smoke formation containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium. Cadmium is a substance considered by IARC to be cancerous and can be found in both work and living environments, therefore it is often difficult to establish rather its presence in the organism is due to working activities and/or the living environment. In these cases it is necessary to evaluate whether the work represents an added risk to develop neoplasia, compared to the consequences due to normal environmental exposure. The added risk linked to work is evaluated comparing the concentration of toxic substances found in the living environments (Environmental Reference Value) with the toxic and/or metabolite found in the working environment, and comparing the biological reports of the population not directly exposed by work (Biological Reference Value) and those exposed. We performed a biological monitoring for lead and cadmium on the workers examined. The Italian Legislature, aside from lead, has not yet issued guidelines pertaining to professional exposure to cadmium, and therefore it is mandatory to take reference to the American Hygienist's charts both for environmental exposure (TLVs) andfor biological monitoring (BEI). Biological monitoring, which allows to evaluate the absorption by both inhalation and gastrointestinally, was performed through measuring the levels of lend and cadmium in the bloodstream (PbB and CdB) and the Cd in urine (CdU). The results show that in no case the levels of lead in the bloodstream (PbB) were above the reference value and BEI. The levels of cadmium urine (CdU) weren't above the reference level and the BEI, while the haematic levels of cadmium (CdB) were higher than the reference value in 8 subjects, each long time smokers, each of about 20 cigarettes a day. This data shows how, in the evaluation of exposition to cadmium, aside from the exam of data pertaining to work, the study of ways of absorption and the interpretation of the results of environmental and biological monitoring, it is important to consider the possibility of intoxication outside of the workplace. Cigarette smoke, as already indicated by other authors, is also confirmed in our studies as one of the major fonts of non professionally linked inhalation of cadmium.</AbstractText>"}

Smoking causes DNA damage, including double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), that leads to carcinogenesis. To test the hypothesis that suboptimal DSB repair capacity is associated with risk of SCCHN, we applied a flow cytometry-based method to detect the DSB repair phenotype first in four EBV-immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines and then in human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (PBTLs). With this blood-based laboratory assay, we conducted a pilot case-control study of 100 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated SCCHN and 124 cancer-free controls of non-Hispanic whites. We found that the mean DSB repair capacity level was significantly lower in cases (42.1%) than that in controls (54.4%) (P&lt;0.001). When we used the median DSB repair capacity level in the controls as the cutoff value for calculating the odds ratios (ORs) with adjustment for age, sex, smoking and drinking status, the cases were more likely than the controls to have a reduced DSB repair capacity (adjusted OR=1.93; 95% confidence interval, CI=1.04-3.56, P=0.037), especially for those subjects who were ever drinkers (adjusted OR=2.73; 95% CI=1.17-6.35, P=0.020) and had oropharyngeal tumors (adjusted OR=2.17; 95% CI=1.06-4.45, P=0.035).

Findings revealed, among 254 practitioners surveyed, low referral rates to the SC clinic. Negative perceptions about cancer patients who smoke existed (e.g., patients needing smoking to control anxiety; patients' willpower sufficient for quitting; patients not wanting to quit and not needing more information). Substantial knowledge gaps were prevalent with regard to the detrimental outcomes associated with continued tobacco use after a cancer diagnosis and with regard to approved SC medication choices. Our results are useful in identifying topics that need to be highlighted during training and educational efforts in the region and also reinforce the need to avail such efforts in order to improve SC-related knowledge and perceptions.</AbstractText>"}

However, little is known concerning the molecular events preceding the development of lung cancer. In this study, we characterize a chemically induced lung cancer mouse model in which lung cancer developed in the presence of silicotic chronic inflammation. Silica-induced lung inflammation increased the incidence and multiplicity of lung cancer in mice treated with N-nitrosodimethylamine, a carcinogen found in tobacco smoke. Histologic and molecular analysis revealed that concomitant chronic inflammation contributed to lung tumorigenesis through induction of preneoplastic changes in lung epithelial cells. In addition, silica-mediated inflammation generated an immunosuppressive microenvironment in which we observed increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), transforming growth factor-β1, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), as well as the presence of regulatory T cells. Finally, the K-RAS mutational profile of the tumors changed from Q61R to G12D mutations in the inflammatory milieu. In summary, we describe some of the early molecular changes associated to lung carcinogenesis in a chronic inflammatory microenvironment and provide novel information concerning the mechanisms underlying the formation and the fate of preneoplastic lesions in the silicotic lung.</AbstractText>"}

We tested the hypothesis that effects of in utero SHS exposure on modulating physiological and transcriptome responses in BALB/c mouse lungs after ovalbumin (OVA) challenge extend well into adulthood, and that the responses show a sex bias. We exposed BALB/c mice in utero to SHS or filtered air (AIR), then sensitized and challenged all offspring with OVA from 19 to 23 weeks of age. At the end of the adult OVA challenge, we evaluated pulmonary function, examined histopathology, analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and assessed gene expression changes in the lung samples. All groups exhibited lung inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Pulmonary function testing (airway hyperresponsiveness [AHR], breathing frequency [f]) and BALF (cell differentials, Th1/Th2 cytokines) assessments showed significantly more pronounced lung responses in the SHS-OVA groups than in AIR-OVA groups (AHR, f; eosinophils, neutrophils; IFN-γ, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, KC/CXCL1, TNF-α), with the majority of responses being more pronounced in males than in females. SHS exposure in utero also significantly altered lung gene expression profiles, primarily of genes associated with inflammatory responses and respiratory diseases, including lung cancer and lung fibrosis. Altered expression profiles of chemokines (Cxcl2, Cxcl5, Ccl8, Ccl24), cytokines (Il1b, Il6, Il13) and acute phase response genes (Saa1, Saa3) were confirmed by qRT-PCR. In conclusion, in utero exposure to SHS exacerbates adult lung responses to OVA challenge and promotes a pro-asthmatic milieu in adult lungs; further, males are generally more affected by SHS-OVA than are females. </AbstractText>"}

Exposure to some of these chemicals may contribute to the etiology of several common types of human cancers. 2-Amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC) is the most abundant HAA formed in mainstream tobacco smoke: it arises in amounts that are 25-100 times greater than the levels of the arylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), a human carcinogen. 2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) is a prevalent HAA formed in cooked meats. AαC and MeIQx are rodent carcinogens; however, their carcinogenic potency in humans is unknown. A preliminary assessment of the carcinogenic potential of these HAAs in humans was conducted by examining the capacity of primary human hepatocytes to form DNA adducts of AαC and MeIQx, in comparison to 4-ABP, followed by the kinetics of DNA adduct removal by cellular enzyme repair systems. The principal DNA adducts formed were N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl) (dG-C8) adducts. Comparable levels of DNA adducts were formed with AαC and 4-ABP, whereas adduct formation was ∼5-fold lower for MeIQx. dG-C8-AαC and dG-C8-4-ABP were formed at comparable levels in a concentration-dependent manner in human hepatocytes treated with procarcinogens over a 10,000-fold concentration range (1 nM-10 μM). Pretreatment of hepatocytes with furafylline, a selective inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2, resulted in a strong diminution of DNA adducts signifying that P450 1A2 is a major P450 isoform involved in bioactivation of these procarcinogens. The kinetics of adduct removal varied for each hepatocyte donor. Approximately half of the DNA adducts were removed within 24 h of treatment; however, the remaining lesions persisted over 5 days. The high levels of AαC present in tobacco smoke and its propensity to form persistent DNA adducts in human hepatocytes suggest that AαC can contribute to DNA damage and the risk of hepatocellular cancer in smokers. </AbstractText>"}

We carried out a clinical trial to determine whether PEITC also inhibits the metabolic activation of NNK in smokers. Cigarette smokers were recruited and asked to smoke cigarettes containing deuterium-labeled [pyridine-D4]NNK for an acclimation period of at least 1 week. Then subjects were randomly assigned to one of two arms: PEITC followed by placebo, or placebo followed by PEITC. During the 1-week treatment period, each subject took PEITC (10 mg in 1 mL of olive oil, 4 times per day). There was a 1-week washout period between the PEITC and placebo periods. The NNK metabolic activation ratio [pyridine-D4]hydroxy acid/total [pyridine-D4]NNAL was measured in urine samples to test the hypothesis that PEITC treatment modified NNK metabolism. Eighty-two smokers completed the study and were included in the analysis. Overall, the NNK metabolic activation ratio was reduced by 7.7% with PEITC treatment (P = 0.023). The results of this trial, while modest in effect size, provide a basis for further investigation of PEITC as an inhibitor of lung carcinogenesis by NNK in smokers.

We observed a higher level of 8-OHdG expression and secretion in airways of lung cancer patients than that of noncancer controls. 8-OHdG expression was associated with the TNM stages. Additionally, cigarette smoke-induced oxidative DNA damage response was observed in bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. A statistical significance correlation was found between the levels of 8-OHdG and smoking index. With a cut-off value of 2.86 ng/ml, 8-OHdG showed a sensitivity and specificity of 70.0% and 73.7%, respectively, to identify a patient with lung cancer. These findings not only underscore the importance of smoking in oxidative DNA damage response of lung cancer patients, but also suggest 8-OHdG as a potential diagnostic biomarker for lung cancer. </AbstractText>"}

Development of newer tobacco products requires the use of quantitative toxicological assays. Recently, v-Ha-ras transfected BALB/c3T3 (Bhas 42) cell transformation assay was established that simulates the two-stage animal tumorigenesis model and measures tumor initiating and promoting activities of chemicals. The present study was performed to assess the feasibility of using this Bhas 42 cell transformation assay to determine the initiation and promotion activities of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and its water soluble fraction. Further, the modulating effects of selenium and arsenic on cigarette smoke-induced cell transformation were investigated. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water extracts of CSC (CSC-D and CSC-W, respectively) were tested at concentrations of 2.5-40 µg mL(-1) in the initiation or promotion assay formats. Initiation protocol of the Bhas 42 assay showed a 3.5-fold increase in transformed foci at 40 µg mL(-1) of CSC-D but not CSC-W. The promotion phase of the assay yielded a robust dose response with CSC-D (2.5-40 µg mL(-1)) and CSC-W (20-40 µg mL(-1)). Preincubation of cells with selenium (100 nM) significantly reduced CSC-induced increase in cell transformation in initiation assay. Co-treatment of cells with a sub-toxic dose of arsenic significantly enhanced cell transformation activity of CSC-D in promotion assay. The results suggest a presence of both water soluble and insoluble tumor promoters in CSC, a role of oxidative stress in CSC-induced cell transformation, and usefulness of Bhas 42 cell transformation assay in comparing tobacco product toxicities and in studying the mechanisms of tobacco carcinogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

To determine whether the lower exposures caused by second-hand smoke are deleterious, we administered tobacco smoke extract (TSE) to pregnant rats starting preconception and continued through the second postnatal week, corresponding to all 3 trimesters of fetal brain development. Dosing was adjusted to produce maternal plasma Nic concentrations encountered with second-hand smoke, an order of magnitude below those seen in active smokers. We then compared TSE effects to those of an equivalent dose of Nic alone, and to a 10-fold higher Nic dose. Gestational exposure to TSE and Nic significantly disrupted cognitive and behavioral function in behavioral tests given during adolescence and adulthood (postnatal weeks 4-40), producing hyperactivity, working memory deficits, and impairments in emotional processing, even at the low exposure levels corresponding to second-hand smoke. Although TSE effects were highly correlated with those of Nic, the effects of TSE were much larger than could be attributed to just the Nic in the mixture. Indeed, TSE effects more closely resembled those of the 10-fold higher Nic levels, but still exceeded their magnitude. In combination with our earlier findings, this study thus completes the chain of causation to prove that second-hand smoke exposure causes neurodevelopmental deficits, originating in disruption of neurodifferentiation, leading to miswiring of neuronal circuits, and as shown here, culminating in behavioral dysfunction. As low level exposure to Nic alone produced neurobehavioral teratology, 'harm reduction' Nic products do not abolish the potential for neurodevelopmental damage.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2016.

This study aimed to explore whether a focus on gender specific determinants of smoking among Indigenous Australians could be identified, thus providing a potentially novel approach to underpin future efforts at intervention. A qualitative research design was employed. Eighty-two participants, comprised of 43 Indigenous women (mean age 32.15, SD, 12.47) and 39 Indigenous men (mean age 34.91, SD, 11.26), participated in one of 12 focus groups held in metropolitan, regional and rural locations in South Australia. Facilitators prompted discussion in response to the question: 'What is it like being a smoker these days?' Two experienced coders assessed data for themes using Attride-Stirling's (2002) method of analysis. Two global themes emerged for men and women. The first theme, 'It's Harder to Smoke Nowadays', encompassed sub-themes capturing changed smoking practices in response to tobacco control strategies implemented in Australia. Sub-themes of 'smoking in secrecy' coupled with an 'awareness of the effects of passive smoking' were identified among women. Among men, sub-themes that depicted tension between 'a desire to be a role model' and 'guilt about smoking' emerged. The second theme, 'Push and Pull Factors', identified a range of gender specific determinants of smoking. While similar reasons for smoking ('pull factors') were identified in men and women (e.g. addiction, boredom, stress, pleasure, mood stabiliser), different 'push factors' (reasons for not wanting to smoke) emerged. For men, sport, fitness and children were identified as reasons for not wanting to smoke, whereas women identified factors such as respect for non-smokers, and body image concerns. The current findings suggest that there may be fundamental differences in the determinants of smoking (pull factors) as well as reasons for wanting to quit (push factors) between Indigenous men and women. A focus on interventions that target gender specific determinants, or motivators of smoking, offers a novel, and potentially efficacious approach to reduce smoking rates among Indigenous Australians. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

METHODS We evaluated participants of the cross-sectional, nation-wide, school-based Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA), which included 12- to 17-year-old adolescents from municipalities of over 100 thousand inhabitants. The study sample had a clustered, stratified design and was representative of the whole country, its geographical regions, and all 27 state capitals. The information was obtained with self-administered questionnaires. Tobacco experimentation was defined as having tried cigarettes at least once in life. Adolescents who had smoked on at least one day over the previous 30 days were considered current cigarette smokers. Having smoked cigarettes for at least seven consecutive days was an indicator for regular consumption of tobacco.

Adolescents aged 15 to 17 years had higher prevalences for all indicators than those aged 12 to 14 years. The prevalences did not differ significantly between sexes. The highest prevalences were found in the South region and the lowest ones, in the Northeast region. Regardless of sex, the prevalences were found to be higher for adolescents who had had paid jobs, who lived with only one parent, and who reported having been in contact with smokers either inside or outside their homes. Female public school adolescents were found to smoke more than the ones from private schools. CONCLUSIONS Tobacco use among adolescents is still a challenge. Intending to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among young people, especially the ones under socioeconomic vulnerability conditions, Brazil must consolidate and increase effective public health care measures. </AbstractText>"}

However, particularly in relation to SCLC there is not enough reliable information. All patients with lung cancer in follow-up for a period of three-months at the Pulmonology Unit of Coimbra University Hospital were retrospectively assessed. From a total of 303 patients, 35 had SCLC, 4 of which were never-smokers and their clinical cases are hereby presented. A detailed questionnaire was given to all patients, which excluded second-hand smoking or occupational hazards. They were all female with a mean age of 63.0 ± 15.7 years. The most frequent complaints were cough, dyspnoea, anorexia and significant weight loss. Diagnosis was obtained by transbronchial biopsies in all cases. Two patients had locally advanced disease and the other two had extensive-disease due to distant metastases. Treatment approaches included first-line chemotherapy with platin and etoposide duplet and partial remission was achieved in half the cases. All patients died; mean survival was 15.8 ± 3.8 months. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the pathogenicity of non-smoking related SCLC and we hope that this case series with its meticulous exclusion of potential risk factors will be a useful contribution.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although sulfation is classically considered as a detoxification event facilitating the excretion of more water soluble metabolites from the body, in some cases such bioconversion may also lead to bioactivation of promutagens, producing highly reactive intermediates which are capable of damaging DNA and promoting carcinogenesis. The most common polymorphism in SULT1A1 (Arg213His) has an important functional impact by affecting the capacity to sulfate diverse substrates and numerous case-control studies have shown associations between SULT1A1 variants and susceptibility to different malignancies. Several factors may significantly influence such relationships, including ethnicity, gender, parity, menopausal status, use of estrogen replacement therapy, exposure to tobacco smoke or occupational chemicals.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS AND CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>In this review article, we show that one more important determinant should be considered as a stratifying factor in studies of possible associations between SULT1A1 variants and cancer risk, i.e., the dietary intake of different flavonoids. As sulfation of bioactive plant polyphenols can change their potential anticancer activities and, on the other hand, these phytochemicals are capable to behave also as potent SULT1A1 inhibitors, the regular dietary exposure of humans to these compounds can make a great contribution to the impact of sulfation capacity on individual susceptibility to carcinogenesis. The effect of specific flavonoids as well as their interactions with other factors on associations between SULT1A1 alleles and cancer risk certainly needs further thorough studies.</AbstractText>"}

Epidemiological studies have shown that coexposure of BQ and cigarette smoke markedly increases the risk of cancer. We previously demonstrated that arecoline, the most abundant alkaloid in the areca nut, inhibits nucleotide excision repair through the repression of p53 activity. To investigate the combined potency of arecoline and BaP in carcinogenesis, we treated human epithelial HEp-2 cells with subcytotoxic doses of arecoline and BaP, alone or in combination, and examined the effects on DNA damage and repair. When exposed for 24h, BaP enhanced DNA repair and p53 transactivation activity. However, these enhancements were suppressed through concurrent treatment of the cells with arecoline. Using a Comet assay, we found that extended exposure to arecoline and BaP caused moderate-to-severe DNA damage in 60% of the cells. Expression of the XPD helicase was transcriptionally suppressed by 1 week of treatment with BaP. Our studies have revealed potential targets in the DNA repair pathway that are affected by BQ and tobacco components, as well as the effect of these components on carcinogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, more research is needed regarding those effects and the effects of alternative tobacco products and of secondhand smoke, the effects of cessation (before diagnosis, during treatment, or during survivorship), the biologic mechanisms, and optimal strategies for tobacco dependence treatment in oncology. Fundamentally, tobacco is an important source of variation in clinical treatment trials. Nevertheless, tobacco use assessment has not been uniform in clinical trials. Progress has been impeded by a lack of consensus regarding tobacco use assessment suitable for cancer patients. The NCI-AACR Cancer Patient Tobacco Use Assessment Task Force identified priority research areas and developed recommendations for assessment items and timing of assessment in cancer research. A cognitive interview study was conducted with 30 cancer patients at the NIH Clinical Center to evaluate and improve the measurement items. The resulting Cancer Patient Tobacco Use Questionnaire (C-TUQ) includes 'Core' items for minimal assessment of tobacco use at initial and follow-up time points, and an 'Extension' set. Domains include the following: cigarette and other tobacco use status, intensity, and past use; use relative to cancer diagnosis and treatment; cessation approaches and history; and secondhand smoke exposure. The Task Force recommends that assessment occur at study entry and, at a minimum, at the end of protocol therapy in clinical trials. Broad adoption of the recommended measures and timing protocol, and pursuit of the recommended research priorities, will help us to achieve a clearer understanding of the significance of tobacco use and cessation for cancer patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although activated modestly by oxidative stress alone, robust activation of the Nrf2 defense mechanism requires the additional presence of co-factors that facilitate electron exchange. Various molecules exhibit this co-factor function, including sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables. However, natural co-factors that are potent and widely available from dietary sources have not been identified previously. The objectives of this study were to investigate support of the Nrf2 cell defense pathway by the alkyl catechols: 4-methylcatechol, 4-vinylcatechol, and 4-ethylcatechol. These small electrochemicals are naturally available from numerous sources but have not received attention. Findings reported here illustrate that these compounds are indeed potent co-factors for activation of the Nrf2 pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Each strongly supports expression of Nrf2 target genes in a variety of human cell types; and, in addition, 4-ethylcatechol is orally active in mice. Furthermore, findings reported here identify important and previously unrecognized sources of these compounds, arising from biotransformation of common plant compounds by lactobacilli that express phenolic acid decarboxylase. Thus, for example, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus collinoides, which are consumed from a diet rich in traditionally fermented foods and beverages, convert common phenolic acids found in fruits and vegetables to 4-vinylcatechol and/or 4-ethylcatechol. In addition, all of the alkyl catechols are found in wood smoke that was used widely for food preservation. Thus, the potentially numerous sources of alkyl catechols in traditional foods suggest that these co-factors were common in ancient diets. However, with radical changes in food preservation, alkyl catechols have been lost from modern foods. The absence of alkyl catechols from the modern Western diet suggests serious negative consequences for Nrf2 cell defense, resulting in reduced protection against multiple chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress. </AbstractText>"}

In the present study, we found that exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induced proliferation and triggered the transition of normal human urothelial cells from G1 to S phase. Moreover, CSE exposure enhanced the expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and decreased the expression of p21 in SV-HUC-1 cells. Furthermore, the levels of nuclear NF-κB p65/p50 were significantly elevated by CSE. Pre-treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) reversed CSE-triggered cell proliferation.

The clinical reports of breast cancer patients with healthy twins and the development of disease in women without high penetrance mutations detected, warn the participation more factors in the transformation process. The high incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma in the modern woman and the urgent need for new methods of prevention and early detection have demanded more information about the role that environment and lifestyle have on the transformation of mammary gland epithelial cells. Obesity, alcoholism and smoking are factors that have shown a close correlation with the risk of developing breast cancer. And although these conditions affect different cell regulation levels, the study of its effects in the mechanisms of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation is considered critical for a better understanding of the loss of identity of epithelial cells during carcinogenesis of this tissue. The main objective of this review was to establish the importance of changes occurring to transcriptional level in the mammary gland as a consequence of acute or chronic exposure to harmful products such as obesity-causing foods, ethanol and cigarette smoke components. At analyze the main studies related to topic, it has concluded that the understanding of effects caused by the lifestyle factors in performance of the transcriptional mechanisms that determine gene expression of the mammary gland epithelial cells, may help explain the development of this disease in women without genetic propensity and different phenotypic manifestations of this cancer type. </AbstractText>"}

Household air pollution (HAP) resulting from the use of these solid fuels is of particular concern, given the overall prevalence as well as the intensity of exposure and the range of potential adverse health outcomes. Long term exposure to HAP is a major public health concern, particularly among women and children in low and middle income countries. In this study, we investigated the association between exposure to HAP resulting from combustion of biomass and lung cancer risk among Nepalese population. Using a hospital-based case-control study (2009-2012), we recruited 606 lung cancer cases and 606 healthy controls matched on age (±5 years), gender, and geographical residence. We used unconditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) for lung cancer risk associated with HAP exposures, adjusting for potential confounders (tobacco use, TB status, SES, age, gender, ethnicity, and exposure to second hand smoke. In our overall analysis, we observed increased risk of lung cancer among those who were exposed to HAPs (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.00-3.14). A more detailed analysis stratified by smoking status showed considerably higher risk of lung cancer associated with increasing duration of exposure to HAP from biomass combustion, with evidence of a borderline exposure-response relationship (Ptrend=0.05) that was more pronounced among never-smokers (Ptrend=0.01). Our results suggest that chronic exposure to HAP resulting from biomass combustion is associated with increased lung cancer risk, particularly among never-smokers in Nepal.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

At the relational level, peers kept smokers connected to pro-smoking norms. There was conflict in the home about smoking and failed cessation, but smokers recognized the benefits of cessation for family harmony and children's health. Physicians encouraged cessation but this tended to be insufficient to prompt action unless a smoker felt ill.

Despite nicotine being a major component of cigarette smoke, it is not carcinogenic when acting alone. Instead, it is believed to function as a tumor promoter. Due to the fatal consequences of lung cancer being primarily associated with the processes of invasion and metastasis, the present study aimed to determine the effect of nicotine on the migratory activity of lung cancer cells. The effect of nicotine on the migration of lung cancer A549 cells was evaluated by a wound healing assay. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was used as a pro-migratory stimulus. During several of the experiments, specific inhibitors of α7-nicotine acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAchR), phosphoinositide kinase-3 (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 were included. The phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK1/2 were examined using a cell-based protein phosphorylation assay. It was observed that nicotine did not induce cell migration by itself, but that it instead promoted HGF-induced cell migration. The effects of nicotine were inhibited by the pretreatment of the cells with the α7-nAchR inhibitor, methyllycaconitine, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase inhibitor exerted modest, but non-significant inhibitory activity on the effect of nicotine. Nicotine did not induce Akt phosphorylation by itself, but instead promoted the HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt. It was also observed that nicotine had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The results from the present study indicate that nicotine, when alone, does not have a pro-migratory function, but instead enhances responsiveness to the pro-migratory stimulus emitted by HGF. The current study provides an insight into the mechanism of tumor promotion by demonstrating that nicotine and α7-nAchRs act in synergy with the HGF-induced PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, increasing the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to HGF, and thereby promoting cell migration, a vital step in invasion and metastasis.</AbstractText>"}

Previously, we reported aggravated asthmatic responses in ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged adult mice that had been exposed in utero to second-hand smoke (SHS). Whether in utero SHS exposure dysregulates miRNA expression patterns in the adult asthma model has not been investigated. Pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed (days 6-19 of pregnancy) to SHS (10 mg/m(3)) or HEPA-filtered air. All offspring were sensitized and challenged with OVA (19-23 weeks) before sacrifice. RNA samples extracted from lung homogenates, were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq identified nine miRNAs that were most significantly up-regulated by in utero SHS exposure. Among these nine, miR-155-5p, miR-21-3p, and miR-18a-5p were also highly correlated with pro-asthmatic Th2 cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Further analysis indicated that these up-regulated miRNAs shared common chromosome locations, particularly Chr 11C, with pro-asthmatic genes. These three miRNAs have also been characterized as oncogenic miRNAs (oncomirs). We cross-referenced miRNA-mRNA expression profiles and identified 16 tumor suppressor genes that were down-regulated in the in utero-exposed offspring and that are predicted targets of the up-regulated oncomirs. In conclusion, in utero SHS exposure activates pro-asthmatic genes and miRNAs, which colocalize at specific chromosome locations, in OVA-challenged adult mice. The oncogenic characteristics of the miRNAs and putative miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks suggest that the synergistic effect of in utero SHS exposure and certain adult irritants may promote an oncogenic milieu in mouse lungs via inhibition of miRNA-regulated tumor suppressor genes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

A PubMed search was conducted to identify original and review articles containing information about these polymophic variants in different populations and according to their prevalence in bladder cancer patients. We noticed that some genotypes were found to be predisposing and some protective for bladder cancer development. The NAT2 slow genotype, together with GSTM1 null genotype facilitated the development of bladder cancer in almost all ethnic groups. The 213His allele of the SULT1A1 gene which is associated with lower enzyme activity and decreased mutagen activation was reported to protect from bladder cancer in almost all studies. </AbstractText>"}

Smoking accounts for approximately 70% of the cases of non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 90% of the cases of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some patients develop lung cancer without a history of smoking. Nicotine is the most active addictive component of tobacco smoke. It does not initiate tumorigenesis in humans and rodents, but it alters the pathophysiology of lung cells by inducing the secretion of growth factors, neurotransmitters and cytokines, and promotes tumour growth and metastases by inducing cell cycle progression, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and the evasion of apoptosis. Most of these effects are a result of nicotine binding and activation of cell-surface neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream intracellular signalling cascades, and many are blocked by nAChR subtype-selective antagonists. Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms of nAChR subunits that influence nicotine dependence and lung cancer. This review describes the molecular basis of nAChR structural and functional diversity in normal and cancer lung cells, and the genetic alterations facilitating smoking-induced lung cancers. It also summarises current knowledge concerning the intracellular pathways activated by nicotine and other compounds present in tobacco smoke.</AbstractText>"}

Contamination by PAHs is due to generation by direct pyrolysis of food nutrients and deposition from smoke produced through incomplete combustion of thermal agents. PAHs are ubiquitous compounds, well-known to be carcinogenic, which can reach the food in different ways. As an important human exposure pathway of contaminants, dietary intake of PAHs is of increasing concern for assessing cancer risk in the human body. In addition, the risks associated with consumption of barbecued meat may increase if consumers use cooking practices that enhance the concentrations of contaminants and their bioaccessibility. Since total PAHs always overestimate the actual amount that is available for absorption by the body, bioaccessibility of PAHs is to be preferred. Bioaccessibility of PAHs in food is the fraction of PAHs mobilized from food matrices during gastrointestinal digestion. An in vitro human digestion model was chosen for assessing the bioaccessibility of PAHs in food as it offers a simple, rapid, low cost alternative to human and animal studies; providing insights which may not be achievable in in vivo studies. Thus, this review aimed not only to provide an overview of general aspects of PAHs such as the formation, carcinogenicity, sources, occurrence, and factors affecting PAH concentrations, but also to enhance understanding of bioaccessibility assessment using an in vitro digestion model.</AbstractText>"}

Specifically, the health impact of emissions from domestic burning of biomass and coal is most relevant and is estimated to contribute to over 4 million premature deaths per year worldwide. Wood is the main fuel source for biomass combustion and the shift towards renewable energy sources will further increase emissions from wood combustion even in developed countries. However, little is known about the constituents of wood smoke and biological mechanisms that are responsible for adverse health effects. We exposed A549 lung epithelial cells to collected wood smoke particles and found an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species as well as a response to bioavailable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, cell vitality and regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 were not affected. Using a candidate approach, we could recapitulate WSP toxicity by the combined actions of its constituents soot, metals and PAHs. The soot fraction and metals were found to be the most important factors for ROS formation, whereas the PAH response can be mimicked by the model PAH benzo[a]pyrene. Strikingly, PAHs adsorbed to WSPs were even more potent in activating target gene expression than B[a]P individually applied in suspension. As PAHs initiate multiple adverse outcome pathways and are prominent carcinogens, their role as key pollutants in wood smoke and its health effects warrants further investigation. The presented results suggest that each of the investigated constituents soot, metals and PAHs are major contributors to WSP toxicity. Mitigation strategies to prevent adverse health effects of wood combustion should therefore not only aim at reducing the emitted soot and PAHs but also the metal content, through the use of more efficient combustion appliances, and particle precipitation techniques, respectively.</AbstractText>"}

The model is based on the previously developed SimSmoke simulation model of tobacco control policy, and uses population size, smoking rates and tobacco control policy data for Mexico. It assesses, individually, and in combination, the effect of six tobacco control policies on smoking prevalence and smoking-related deaths. Policies included: cigarette excise taxes, smoke-free laws, anti-smoking public education campaigns, marketing restrictions, access to tobacco cessation treatments and enforcement against tobacco sales youth. The model estimates that, if Mexico were to adopt strong tobacco control policies compared to current policy levels, smoking prevalence could be reduced by 30% in the next decade and by 50% by 2053; an additional 470,000 smoking-related premature deaths could be averted over the next 40 years. The greatest impact on smoking and smoking-related deaths would be achieved by raising excise taxes on cigarettes from 55% to at least 70% of the retail price, followed by strong youth access enforcement and access to cessation treatments. Implementing tobacco control policies in Mexico could reduce smoking prevalence by 50%, and prevent 470,000 smoking-related deaths by 2053.</AbstractText>"}

The percentage of five- to six-ring PAHs was high, indicating that PAHs found in indoor dust mainly originate from pyrolysis rather than a petrogenic source. Rooms were divided into three groups using cluster analysis on the basis of 16 PAH compositions, namely smoke-free homes, homes exposed to smoke and offices. Results showed that the source of PAHs in smoke-free residential homes is primarily the burning of fossil fuels. In addition to the burning of fossil fuels, biomass combustion and cooking contributed to PAHs in houses exposed to smoke (including kitchens). Motor vehicles are an additional source of PAHs in offices because of greater interactions with the outdoor environment. The results of health risk assessment showed that the cancer risk levels by dermal contact and ingestion are 10<sup>4</sup>- to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold higher than that by inhalation, suggesting that ingestion and dermal contact of carcinogenic PAHs in dust are more important exposure routes than inhalation of PAHs from air. Although the results showed high potential of PAH concentrations in indoor dust in Changchun for human health risk, caution should be taken to evaluate the risk of PAHs calculated by USEPA standard models with default parameters because habitation styles are different in various categories of rooms.</AbstractText>"}

Recent studies have suggested that nicotine may reduce inflammation and improve angiogenesis, so topical application may be beneficial for smokers. The electronic cigarette is increasing in popularity and more patients ask whether they can vape after operation. We investigated the effect of electronic cigarettes (of which half contained nicotine and half did not) on blood flow in the buccal mucosa in 10 volunteers immediately after vaping. Smokers were excluded as this was considered an additional variable in a small pilot study and our Trust has a no-smoking policy. After vaping for 5 minutes, capillary blood flow was measured in the buccal mucosa at 5-minute intervals using a laser Doppler probe, and the results were expressed as arbitrary perfusion units. There was a wide variation in results and a small but significant rise (p=0.008) as a result of nicotine vaping, but these fell to the same levels as before within 30 minutes. Electronic cigarettes may have an effect on blood flow to the oral mucosa, although further studies are needed to show whether they improve healing time after operation.

Creation of a total household smoking ban can reduce associated health conditions such as asthma, lung cancer, heart disease and stroke. This paper describes the results of a randomized control trial of a minimal intervention to create smoke-free homes. 2-1-1 callers were invited to participate in the trial and were randomized to an intervention (mailings and a coaching call) or a control group (no intervention). We assessed reach, dose, fidelity, and receptivity to the intervention through program records and a 3-month follow-up survey with intervention participants. For the intervention materials, materials were mailed to 244 participants (99.2%) and 227 participants (92.3%) received the coaching call intervention. 92.3% received all intervention components. Participants who had full household bans at 3 months were more likely to conduct behaviors leading to a smoke-free home (i.e., making a list of reasons, having a family talk, posting a pledge) than were those with no/partial ban. The intervention materials also were rated higher in relevance and usefulness by non-smokers than smokers. Results demonstrate that this minimal intervention had high fidelity to the delivery of components and relatively high receptivity. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that the defect is mediated via inhibition of sphingosine kinases and/or their subcellular mislocalization in response to cigarette smoke and can be normalized with exogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate or FTY720 (fingolimod), a modulator of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, which has been shown to be clinically useful in multiple sclerosis. Measurement of sphingosine kinase 1/2 activities by [(32)P]-labeled sphingosine-1-phosphate revealed a 30% reduction of sphingosine kinase 1 (P &lt; 0.05) and a nonsignificant decrease of sphingosine kinase 2 in THP-1 macrophages after 1 h cigarette smoke extract exposure. By confocal analysis macrophage sphingosine kinase 1 protein was normally localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm and sphingosine kinase 2 to the nucleus and cytoplasm but absent at the cell surface. Cigarette smoke extract exposure (24 h) led to a retraction of sphingosine kinase 1 from the plasma membrane and sphingosine kinase 1/2 clumping in the Golgi domain. Selective inhibition of sphingosine kinase 2 with 25 µM ABC294640 led to 36% inhibition of efferocytosis (P &lt; 0.05); 10 µM sphingosine kinase inhibitor/5C (sphingosine kinase 1-selective inhibitor) induced a nonsignificant inhibition of efferocytosis, but its combination with ABC294640 led to 56% inhibition (P &lt; 0.01 vs. control and &lt; 0.05 vs. single inhibitors).

However, addressing tobacco in patients being treated for comorbid conditions is not a consistent practice. Recognizing the need for a 'call-to-action' to address tobacco use in people with comorbid conditions, the Tobacco Treatment Network within the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) convened a Comorbidities Workgroup to explore the relationship between smoking and comorbid disease to identify common themes including: the harms associated with continued tobacco use, the frequency of comorbid disease and tobacco use, the potential effect of comorbid disease on the ability to quit tobacco use, the association between tobacco use and suboptimal disease-specific treatment response, and evidence regarding potential approaches to improve addressing tobacco use in patients with comorbid disease. Five candidate conditions (psychiatric, cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and human immunodeficiency virus infected patients) were explored. Across comorbid conditions, smoking adversely affects treatment efficacy and promotes other adverse health conditions. People with comorbid conditions who smoke are motivated to quit and respond to evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. However, tobacco cessation is not regularly incorporated into the clinical care of many individuals with comorbidities. Optimal strategies for addressing tobacco use within each comorbid disease are also not well defined.

Recent studies have also indicated that RNA-binding motif protein 5 (RBM5) can modulate apoptosis and suppress tumor growth. The present study focused on the role of RBM5 in the regulation of cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced transformation of bronchial epithelial cells into the cancerous phenotype and its mechanism of action. Herein, we exposed normal BEAS-2B cells for 8 days to varying concentrations of CSE or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), followed by a recovery period of 2 weeks. Next, the RBM5 protein was overexpressed in these transformed BEAS-2B cells though lentiviral infection. Later, the morphological changes, cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and migration were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the role of RBM5 in xenograft growth. The expression of RBM5 along with the genes related to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and invasion were also examined. Finally, our results revealed that BEAS-2B cells exposed to 100 µg/ml CSE acquired phenotypic changes and formed tumors in nude mice, indicative of their cancerous transformation and had reduced RBM5 expression. Subsequent overexpression of RBM5 in these cells significantly inhibited their proliferation, induced G1/S arrest, triggered apoptosis and inhibited their invasion and migration, including xenograft growth. Thus, we established an in vitro model of CSE-induced cancerous transformation and concluded that RBM5 overexpression inhibited the growth of these transformed cells through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Therefore, our study suggests the importance of RBM5 in the pathogenesis of smoking-related cancer.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated the effects of grilling procedures on the level of 4 PAHs; benzo[a]anthracene (B[a]A), chrysene (Chr), benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). PAHs were extracted and determined by gas chromatography with mass detection (GC-MS). With regard to barbecuing successive meat samples with the same batch of burning charcoal, it was observed that stable combustion contribute to reduction of PAHs. Significant reductions in the sum of the four PAHs were observed through treatments which removed meat drippings and smoke with alternative grilling apparatus. The sums of 4 PAHs were reduced 48-89% with dripping removed and 41-74% with the smoke removal treatment in grilled pork and beef meats than conventional grilling. We investigated the components of meats drippings. The major constituent of meat dripping was fat. The most important factor contributing to the production of PAHs in grilling was smoke resulting from incomplete combustion of fat dripped onto the fire. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article focuses on the first century of the global tobacco epidemic and its current status, reviewing the current and projected future of the global tobacco epidemic and the steps that are in progress to end it. In the United States and many countries of Western Europe, tobacco consumption peaked during the 1960s and 1970s and declined as tobacco control programs were initiated, motivated by the evidence indicting smoking as a leading cause of disease. Despite this policy advancement and the subsequent reductions in tobacco consumption, the global tobacco epidemic continued to grow exponentially in the later years of the twentieth century, as the multinational companies sought new markets to replace those shrinking in high-income countries. In response, between 2000 and 2004, the World Health Organization developed its first public health treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which entered into force in 2005. An accompanying package of interventions has been implemented. New approaches to tobacco control, including plain packaging and single representation of brands, have been implemented by Australia and Uruguay, respectively, but have been challenged by the tobacco industry. </AbstractText>"}

However, emerging data indicate that toxins in tobacco smoke cause cellular injury due to enhanced toxic/metabolic effects of metabolites, disruption of intracellular signaling mechanisms, and formation of DNA, protein, and lipid adducts that impair function and promote oxidative stress and inflammation. These effects of smoking, which are largely non-carcinogenic, can be produced by tobacco-specific nitrosamines and their metabolites. These factors could account for the increased rates of neurodegeneration and insulin resistance diseases among smokers. Herein, we review nicotine and tobacco-specific nitrosamine metabolism, mechanisms of adduct formation, DNA damage, mutagenesis, and potential mechanisms of disease. </AbstractText>"}

Many of the diseases associated with cigarette smoking are also associated with changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. In this study, we investigated the role of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) in IL-6 expression induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Treatment with CSE increased PLD1 and IL-6 expressions in human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. In addition, CSE treatment activated PLC, PKC, and MAPK pathway through the Gi protein-coupled receptor. Pertussis toxin (PTX, Gi protein-coupled receptor inhibitor), PAO (PLC inhibitor), Go6976 (PKC inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38MAPK inhibitor) decreased CSE-induced PLD1 expression. The results show that Gi protein, PLC, PKC, and p38MAPK act as upstream regulators of PLD1 in CSE-treated BEAS-2B cells. Moreover, PLD1 siRNA transfection decreased CSE-induced ATF2 phosphorylation and IL-6 expression. In addition, inhibitors of Gi protein, PLC, PKC, and p38MAPK, and ATF2 siRNA transfection decreased CSE-induced IL-6 expression, suggesting that CSE-induced IL-6 expression is regulated via Gi protein/PLC/PKC/p38MAPK/PLD1/ATF2 pathway. Taken together, the results suggest that PLD1 is an important regulator of IL-6 expression induced by CSE in BEAS-2B cells.</AbstractText>"}

The mevalonate pathway, through its modifying effects on innate immune responsiveness, may be involved in these processes providing a plausible pathogenic link between the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The mevalonate pathway, mediates these effects through important intra-cellular signalling molecules called guanine phosphate transferases (GTPases) such as Rho-A. Smoke exposure activates cell surface proteins which, through the mediating influence of GTPases, then modify the activation of NFkB and its downstream effects on genes underlying innate immunity, neutrophilic inflammation and carcinogenesis. The mevalonate pathway is readily and substantially modified by inhibition of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMGCo-A) reductase. This enzyme controls the rate limiting step of the mevalonate pathway and is subject to inhibition by statin drugs and small chain fatty acids derived from high dietary fibre intake. Thus inhibiting the mevelonate pathway, and dampening the innate immune response to smoking, may play a critical role in modifying pulmonary inflammation and lung remodelling. Such an action might slow the progression of COPD and reduce the tendency to the development of lung cancer. This review examines the pre-clinical and clinical data suggesting that HMGCoA-reductase inhibition and it's modification of the mevalonate pathway, may have a chemo-preventive effect on lung cancer, particularly in patients with COPD where pulmonary inflammation is increased and the risk of lung cancer is greatest.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</CopyrightInformation>"}

WTS prevalence has increased dramatically among youth in the United States within the past decade. Misperceived as less harmful than cigarette smoking, WTS is associated with many of the same chronic health effects such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, bronchitis, and asthma. Much of this risk is due to the fact that a single WTS session exposes users to large volumes of smoke that contain toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide, cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile aldehydes. Unlike cigarette smoking, WTS poses unique risks of acute negative health outcomes including carbon monoxide poisoning and the spread of communicable diseases such as herpes and tuberculosis. Because waterpipe tobacco smoke contains the addictive chemical nicotine, youth who smoke tobacco from a waterpipe may be at risk for dependence. As a result, many youth may initiate WTS and continue to use despite negative health effects. Considering many of the potential negative health effects associated with WTS affect the pulmonary system, pulmonologists and primary care providers may treat patients who are waterpipe tobacco smokers and should be aware of the risk associated with WTS. The purpose of this review is to describe a waterpipe, the prevalence and correlates of WTS, the toxicants found in waterpipe tobacco smoke, the health effects of WTS, and implications for pulmonologists and other clinicians.</AbstractText>"}

We have previously identified iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2) as an important COPD susceptibility gene and have shown that IRP2 protein is increased in the lungs of individuals with COPD. Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD. </AbstractText>"}

Here we employed a genetic animal model of early stages of PDAC that overexpresses oncogenic Kras in the pancreas to investigate the mechanisms of smoking-induced promotion of the disease in vivo. We confirmed the regulation of the interactions between the tumor microenvironment cells using in vitro cellular systems. Aerial exposure to cigarette smoke stimulated development of pancreatic intraepithelial neaoplasia (PanIN) lesions associated with a tumor microenvironment-containing features of human PDAC including fibrosis, activated stellate cells, M2-macrophages and markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The pro-cancer effects of smoking were prevented by Histone Deacetylase HDAC I/II inhibitor Saha. Smoking decreased histone acetylation associated with recruitment of and phenotypic changes in macrophages; which in turn, stimulated survival and induction of EMT of the pre-cancer and cancer cells. The interaction between the cancer cells and macrophages is mediated by IL-6 produced under the regulation of HDAC3 translocation to the nucleus in the cancer cells. Pharmacological and molecular inhibitions of HDAC3 decreased IL-6 levels in cancer cells. IL-6 stimulated the macrophage phenotype change through regulation of the IL-4 receptor level of the macrophage. This study demonstrates a novel pathway of interaction between cancer cells and tumor promoting macrophages involving HDAC3 and IL-6. It further demonstrates that targeting HDAC3 prevents progression of the disease and could provide a strategy for treating the disease considering that the HDAC inhibitor we used is FDA approved for a different disease.</AbstractText>"}

Carcinogenic nitroso compounds (NOC), such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), are present in tobacco and processed red meat, and NOC have been implicated in colon cancer. Azoxymethane (AOM), commonly used for experimental colon carcinogenesis, is an isomer of NDMA, and it produces the same DNA adducts as does NDMA. Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) formed during the combustion of tobacco and high-temperature cooking of meats are also associated with an elevated risk of colon cancer. The most abundant carcinogenic HAA formed in tobacco smoke is 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC), whereas 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) is the most potent carcinogenic HAA formed during the cooking of meat and fish. However, the comparative tumor-initiating potential of AαC, MeIQ, and AOM is unknown.

These were: N-acetyl-L-cysteine, vitamin C, A and E, beta-carotene, lycopene, andrographolide, farnesol, resveratrol, marigold and tea. These studies were carried out on experimental animals or animal or human cells, which were exposed to cigarette smoke or its extract, or components of tobacco smoke. The studies have shown that the mentioned compounds and raw materials have a protective effect against the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. Mechanisms of action were different--the increase of the level of glutathione and antioxidant enzymes, prevention DNA strand breakage and lipid peroxidation, increased accumulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 that controls the expression of antioxidant genes.

An increase in the levels of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), a multifaceted endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone, has been demonstrated in human smokers, presumably as a protective adaptation to cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. We found a similar increase in the levels of PDI in the murine model of COPD. We also found abnormally high levels (4-6 times) of oxidized and sulfenilated forms of PDI in the lungs of murine smokers compared with non-smokers. PDI oxidation progressively increases with age. We begin to delineate the possible role of an increased ratio of oxidized PDI in the age-related onset of COPD by investigating the impact of exposure to CS radicals, such as acrolein (AC), hydroxyquinones (HQ), peroxynitrites (PN), and hydrogen peroxide, on their ability to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) and their effects on the structure and function of PDIs. Exposure to AC, HQ, PN, and CS resulted in cysteine and tyrosine nitrosylation leading to an altered three-dimensional structure of the PDI due to a decrease in helical content and formation of a more random coil structure, resulting in protein unfolding, inhibition of PDI reductase and isomerase activity in vitro and in vivo, and subsequent induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Addition of glutathione prevented the induction of UPR, and AC and HQ induced structural changes in PDI. Exposure to PN and glutathione resulted in conjugation of PDI possibly at active site tyrosine residues. The findings presented here propose a new role of PDI in the pathogenesis of COPD and its age-dependent onset. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The association between the whole-gene deletion of CYP2A6 (CYP2A6*4) and a reduced risk of bladder cancer was suggested in Chinese Han smokers. However, there is no evidence for association between the risk of bladder cancer and CYP2A6 genotypes in the Japanese population. Using genomic DNA from smokers of the Japanese population (163 bladder cancer patients and 116 controls), we conducted a case-control study to assess the association between CYP2A6 polymorphisms and the risk of bladder cancer. Determination of CYP2A6 genotypes was carried out by amplifying each exon of CYP2A6 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. The CYP2A6*4 allele was identified by an allele-specific PCR assay. Bladder cancer risk was evaluated using the activity score (AS) system based on CYP2A6 genotypes. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the AS 0, AS 0.5, AS 1.0, and AS 1.5 groups were 0.46 (0.12-1.83), 0.43 (0.15-1.25), 0.86 (0.40-1.86), and 1.36 (0.60-3.06), respectively. In conclusion, although decreased CYP2A6 AS tended to reduce the risk of bladder cancer in Japanese smokers, no significant association was recognized in this population. However, given the relatively small size of the sample, further study is required to conclude the lack of a statistically significant association between CYP2A6 genotypes and the risk of bladder cancer. </AbstractText>"}

Optimization of a rigorously quantitative migration assay that is both easy to customize and cost-effective to perform is key to answering questions concerning alterations in cell migration in response to various stimuli. Current methods for quantifying cell migration, including scratch assays, trans-well migration assays (Boyden chambers), micropillar arrays, and cell exclusion zone assays, possess a range of limitations in reproducibility, customizability, quantification, and cost-effectiveness.

Smoking-induced oxidative stress is thought to contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and lung cancer through degenerative processes in the lung and other tissues. It is uncertain however whether smoking cessation lowers the burden of oxidative stress. We used data from a randomized controlled cessation trial of 434 current smokers for a post-hoc examination of the effects of smoking cessation on blood plasma levels of total glutathione (tGSH), the most abundant endogenous antioxidant in cells, and total cysteine (tCys), an amino acid and constituent of glutathione. Smoking status was validated based on serum cotinine levels. Multivariate linear mixed models were fitted to examine the association of smoking cessation and change in cigarette consumption with tGSH and tCys. After 12 months follow-up, quitters (n=55) had significantly increased levels of tGSH compared to subjects who continued to smoke (P&lt;0.01). No significant change in tGSH was found for subjects who continued to smoke but reduced their intensity of smoking. No significant effect of smoking cessation or reduction was observed on levels of tCys. These results suggest that smoking cessation but not smoking reduction reduces levels of oxidative stress. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Seventy-four pre-menopausal women from eastern India using biomass and 65 control women who cooked with cleaner liquefied petroleum gas were enrolled. PM10 and PM2.5 levels in their indoor air were measured with real-time aerosol monitors. The levels of membrane-bound RANKL on leukocytes and percentage CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes in the subjects' blood were assayed by flow cytometry. Soluble RANKL and OPG in serum were measured by ELISA. The results showed that PM10 and PM2.5 levels were significantly higher in the indoor air of biomass-using households. Compared with the control women, the levels of CD4(+) and CD19(+) lymphocytes and circulating granulocytes with elevated levels of membrane-bound RANKL were higher in biomass users. The serum levels of RANKL were increased by 41% whereas serum OPG was reduced by 22% among biomass users. The absolute number of CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes was significantly increased in biomass users than the control women. After controlling for potential confounders, PM10 and PM2.5 levels were found to be positively associated with leukocyte and serum RANKL and CD14(+) CD16(+) monocyte levels, but negatively with serum OPG. From these results, we can conclude that chronic exposure to biomass smoke increased membrane-bound and soluble RANKL and circulating osteoclast precursors but decreased OPG, suggesting an increased risk of bone resorption and consequent osteoporosis in biomass-exposed women of a child-bearing age.

Many studies have indicated that slow acetylation of NAT2 increases the risk of bladder cancer. The major risk factor is tobacco smoke; however, some studies have failed to prove this. This study attempted to explore the correlation between NAT2 slow acetylation and bladder cancer risk through a meta-analysis of published case-control studies. Studies detecting NAT2 gene status in bladder cancer patients and healthy controls were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane, EMchrane, CBM, and CNKI. We retrieved the data of cited articles and publications to identify and compare NAT2 gene in bladder cancer patients and healthy controls. The variables within and between the studies were also considered. The META module in the Stata v.6.0 software was used for data analysis. Twenty independent studies were enrolled in our meta-analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individual differences in the bladder cancer susceptibility were, in part, attributed to the effect of carcinogens. The merged odds ratio of the effect of slow acetylation on bladder cancer was 1.31 (95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.55). In conclusion, NAT2 slow acetylation state was associated with bladder cancer risk, and was shown to modestly increase the risk of bladder cancer. </AbstractText>"}

Oral cavity cancer is another debilitating and often fatal cancer closely linked to tobacco product use. While great strides have been made in decreasing tobacco use in the United States and some other countries, there are still an estimated 1 billion men and 250 million women in the world who are cigarette smokers and there are hundreds of millions of smokeless tobacco users, all at risk for cancer. Worldwide, lung cancer kills about three people per minute. This Account focuses on metabolites and biomarkers of two powerful tobacco-specific nitrosamine carcinogens, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), considered to be among the main causes of lung cancer and oral cavity cancer in people who use tobacco products. Three properties of NNK and NNN are critical for successful biomarker studies: they are present in all tobacco products, they are tobacco-specific and are not found in any other product, and they are strong carcinogens. NNK and NNN are converted in humans to urinary metabolites that can be quantified by mass spectrometry as biomarkers of exposure to these carcinogens. They are also metabolized to diazonium ions and related electrophiles that react with DNA to form addition products that can be detected and quantified by mass spectrometry. These urinary metabolites and DNA addition products can serve as biomarkers of exposure and metabolic activation, respectively. The biomarkers of exposure, in particular the urinary NNK metabolites 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and its glucuronides, have been extensively applied to document tobacco-specific lung carcinogen uptake in smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. Highly sensitive mass spectrometric methods have been developed for quantitative analysis of these NNK metabolites as well as metabolites of NNN in human urine, blood, and toenails. Urinary and serum NNAL have been related to lung cancer risk, and urinary NNN has been related to esophageal cancer risk in prospective epidemiology studies. These results are consistent with carcinogenicity studies of NNK, NNAL, and NNN in rats, which show that NNK and NNAL induce mainly lung tumors, while NNN causes tumors of the esophagus and oral cavity. Biomarkers of metabolic activation of NNK and NNN applied in human studies include the metabolism of deuterium labeled substrates to distinguish NNK and NNN metabolism from that of nicotine and the determination of DNA and hemoglobin adducts in tissues, blood, and oral cells from people exposed to tobacco products. As these methods are continually improved in parallel with the ever increasing sensitivity and selectivity of mass spectrometers, development of a comprehensive biomarker panel for identifying tobacco users at high risk for cancer appears to be a realistic goal. Targeting high risk individuals for smoking cessation and cancer surveillance can potentially decrease the risk of developing fatal cancers. </AbstractText>"}

Their irritant, toxic and carcinogenic potential has been well documented. Passive smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) in public places, including workplace, poses major medical problems. Owing to this fact there is a strong need to raise workers' awareness of smoking-related hazards through educational programs and to develop and implement legislation aimed at eliminating SHS exposure. This paper presents a review of reports on passive exposure to tobacco smoke and its impact on human health and also a review of binding legal regulations regarding smoking at workplace in Poland. It has been proved that exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy may lead to, e.g., preterm delivery and low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, lung function impairment, asthma and acute respiratory illnesses in the future. Exposure to tobacco smoke, only in the adult age, is also considered as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, acute and chronic respiratory diseases and cancer. Raising public awareness of tobacco smoke harmfulness should be a top priority in the field of workers' health prevention. Occupational medicine physicians have regular contacts with occupationally active people who smoke. Thus, occupational health services have a unique opportunity to increase employees and employers' awareness of adverse health effects of smoking and their prevention.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>This work is available in Open Access model and licensed under a CC BY-NC 3.0 PL license.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others.

Smoking increases lung cancer risk 5- to 10-fold with a clear dose-response relationship. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among nonsmokers increases lung cancer risk about 20%. Risks for marijuana and hookah use, and the new e-cigarettes, are yet to be consistently defined and will be important areas for continued research as use of these products increases. Other known environmental risk factors include exposures to radon, asbestos, diesel, and ionizing radiation. Host factors have also been associated with lung cancer risk, including family history of lung cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infections. Studies to identify genes associated with lung cancer susceptibility have consistently identified chromosomal regions on 15q25, 6p21 and 5p15 associated with lung cancer risk. Risk prediction models for lung cancer typically include age, sex, cigarette smoking intensity and/or duration, medical history, and occupational exposures, however there is not yet a risk prediction model currently recommended for general use.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected following exposure and analyzed for inflammatory mediators. Asbestos-exposed mice displayed an increased innate immune response consistent with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Compared to mice exposed only to asbestos, animals coexposed to CS + asbestos displayed attenuated levels of innate immune mediators and altered inflammatory cell recruitment. Histopathological changes in CS + asbestos-exposed mice correlated with attenuated fibroproliferative lesion development relative to their counterparts exposed only to asbestos. In vitro experiments using a human monocyte cell line (THP-1 cells) supported the in vivo results in that coexposure to cigarette smoke extract repressed NLRP3 inflammasome markers in cells treated with asbestos. These observations indicate that CS represses central components of the innate immune response to inhaled asbestos. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2015 The Authors.

Selected arylamines in cigarette smoke are recognized human bladder carcinogens and undergo biotransformation through several detoxification pathways, such as the glutathione S-transferases (GST), and uridine-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) pathways. GSTM1 deletion status and UGT1A1*28 rs8175347 genotypes were assessed in 189 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC) patients with pTa (77.2%) and pT1 (22.8%) tumors and a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, to investigate whether two common functional polymorphisms in GSTM1 and UGT1A1 genes and smoking history are associated with recurrence-free survival of patients with NMIBC. Most patients were current (48.7%) or previous (35.4%) cigarette smokers and 15.9% never smoked. Tumor recurrence occurred in 65.1% of patients, at a median time of 12.9 months. Upon multivariate analysis, previous and current smokers approximately tripled their risk of recurrences [HR = 2.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-7.40 and HR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.08-7.94, respectively].

{"PMID":26637246,"Title":"Second-hand smoke in Italy.","Journal":"European journal of paediatric dentistry","Date":"Dec 2015","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Second-hand smoke (SHS) has been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) [IARC, 2004]. Of the 5.7 million deaths attributable each year to tobacco smoking, more than 600,000 (i.e., around 1% of all deaths worldwide) refer to subjects who never smoked and that prematurely die due to their lifetime exposure to SHS [WHO, 2012]. Italy has been one of the pioneering countries - and the first large country worldwide - to enact a comprehensive smoke-free legislation in 2005. The law, introduced in order to reduce SHS exposure, banned smoking in indoor public places, including restaurants and bars, and in all workplaces [Gallus et al., 2006]. This legislation has had an undisputed success from a public health perspective: it was widely supported and strongly observed, restaurant and bar owners did not experience any dreaded decline in their business, and tobacco smoking (and its detrimental health effects) substantially decreased [Gallus et al., 2006; Gorini et al., 2007]. More importantly, the regulation has been effective in dramatically reducing SHS exposure [Gorini et al., 2007; Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2012]. Most high- income countries followed Italy in the adoption of similar comprehensive smoking ban legislations over the last decade [IARC, 2009]. These regulations and the information campaigns conducted for their enforcement had also the effect to increase the social unacceptability of SHS and consequently the adoption of voluntary home smoking bans [Ferketich et al., 2014; Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2014]. This notwithstanding, in 2010 specific Italian subpopulations were still frequently exposed to SHS, both in public and private places. In particular, 54% of the young (i.e., age 15-24 years) were still exposed to SHS in any settings, 27% in private houses, and 33% in private cars [Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2012]. The relatively high SHS exposure in private cars is of particular concerns. Inside vehicles, in fact, the smoke of one single cigarette causes concentrations of fine particulate matter three times higher than what is considered the threshold of hazard. According to surveys conducted by DOXA (an Italian statistical and opinion research company) in 2011-2012, two thirds of Italian smokers smoked in private cars [Martinez-Sanchez, Gallus et al., 2014]. Despite this, 80% of Italian adults (and 49% of current smokers) supported a smoking ban in private cars, and 93% (and 84% of current smokers) supported such a ban in cars carrying children [Martinez-Sanchez, Gallus et al., 2014]. We therefore welcome the incoming Minister's Decree banning tobacco smoking in private vehicles in presence of minors or pregnant women. The risk associated to SHS exposure is still largely underestimated. To give an idea of its harmful effect, we recommend viewing a video realised by colleagues at the National Cancer Institute of Milan, showing how the indoor air pollution generated by one single cigarette is 4 to 6 times higher than that produced by a diesel truck [Ruprecht et al., 2015]. There is a need to further inform the (Italian) population, including in particular smokers with young children, about the harmful effects of SHS, in order to increase the number of smoke-free homes and cars. In this sense, paediatricians or paediatric dentists have today the opportunity to give a major help. Their contribution can imply a minimum effort, e.g., providing informative leaflets, or making available, in the waiting rooms of their clinics, monitors showing informative videos, including the one previously described [Ruprecht et al., 2015].</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study was to identify factors significantly associated with smoking initiation and/or smoking cessation as well as the most important determinants of successful smoking cessation in a developed non-Western setting. Based on multiple logistic regression models, the odds ratios (ORs) for smoking initiation and cessation were estimated among males (N = 24,490) who had participated in the Health Examinees (HEXA) study. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association between selected predictors of smoking cessation and the likelihood of reaching this goal. Finally, Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to illustrate the distribution of time from age at smoking initiation to age at smoking cessation. We found that the ORs for successfully quitting smoking increased with age, married status, educational achievement, having a non-manual job, drinking cessation and disease morbidity. Those exposed to secondhand smoking showed less likelihood of quitting smoking. A continual decrease in the ORs for successfully quitting smoking was observed according to increased smoking duration, smoking dose per day and lifetime tobacco exposure (ptrend &lt;0.001). Among the selected predictors, lifetime tobacco exposure, educational attainment, alcohol drinking status and birth cohort were the major determinants in the success of smoking cessation. Our findings suggest that lifetime tobacco exposure, educational attainment, alcohol drinking status and birth cohort can determine success in smoking cessation. Public interventions promoting a smoke-free environment are needed to reinforce discouraging the initiation of, reducing, and quitting cigarette smoking. </AbstractText>"}

IREB2 is a gene that produces iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), which has a key role in iron homeostasis. This review addresses pathways involved in iron metabolism, particularly focusing on the role of IREB2. In addition to this, environmental factors also influence phenotypic variation in respiratory disease, for example inhaled iron from cigarette smoke is deposited in the lung and causes tissue damage by altering iron homeostasis. The effects of cigarette smoke are detailed in this article, particularly in relation to lung conditions that favour the upper lobes, such as emphysema and lung cancer. Clinical applications of iron homeostasis are also discussed in this review, especially looking at the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

In order to investigate such mechanisms, the present study aimed to systemically interrogate microarray datasets from tumor biopsies and matching normal tissues from stage I and II lung adenocarcinoma patients who had never smoked or were current smokers. The gene expression analysis identified 422 (99 upregulated and 323 downregulated) and 534 (174 upregulated and 360 downregulated) differentially-expressed genes from the never-smokers and current smokers, respectively, and the two groups shared 277 genes that exhibited similar trends of alteration. These genes encode regulators that are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including collagen metabolism and homeostasis of caveolae plasma membranes. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes characterization indicated that biological pathways, including extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and cell migration and proliferation, were all affected in the lung cancer patients regardless of the smoking status. However, smoking induced a unique gene expression pattern characterized by upregulation of cell cycle regulators (<i>CDK1</i>, <i>CCNB1</i> and <i>CDC20</i>), as well as significantly affected biological networks, including p53 signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest novel mechanistic insights, and provide an improved understanding of the smoking-induced molecular alterations that contribute to the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma.</AbstractText>"}

However, few studies have examined the sociodemographic factors associated with smoking in pregnancy or the predictors of antenatal-care attendance among Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian women who smoke. Data from the South Australian perinatal statistics collection of all births from 2000-2010 (n=197538) were analysed separately by Indigenous status to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with smoking in pregnancy and antenatal-care attendance by women who smoke. For Indigenous and non-Indigenous women, smoking in pregnancy was significantly independently associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, residing in regional or remote areas, increased parity, unemployment, being a public patient and attending fewer antenatal care visits. Smoking in pregnancy was associated with younger age and not being partnered only for non-Indigenous women. For Indigenous and non-Indigenous pregnant women who smoked, antenatal-care attendance was lower among women who were of younger age, higher parity, unemployed and not partnered. Differences in attendance within sociodemographic factors were greater for Indigenous women. Therefore, while sociodemographic correlates of smoking in pregnancy and antenatal-care attendance are largely similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous women, tailored cessation and antenatal-care programs that reflect the differences in sociodemographic groups most at risk may be beneficial.</AbstractText>"}

Breaking this cancer-promoting interaction poses an opportunity for cancer prevention. The tumor-promoting function of interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been documented; however, the underlying mechanisms of this function in lung carcinogenesis are not well elucidated. Here, we show that benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE, the active metabolite of cigarette smoke carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene)-induced human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) transformation was enhanced by IL-6 in vitro. The carcinogen/IL-6-transformed cells exhibited higher expression of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) when compared with cells transformed by BPDE alone. Constitutive STAT3 activation drove cell proliferation and survival through anti-apoptosis gene expression. We further show that quercetin, a dietary compound having preventive properties for lung cancer, decreased BPDE-stimulated IL-6 secretion from human lung fibroblasts through inhibition of the NF-κB and ERK pathways. The inhibition was accomplished at clinically achievable concentrations of the compound. Finally, quercetin blocked IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in HBECs, and IL-6 enhancement of HBEC transformation by BPDE was abolished by quercetin treatment. Altogether, our data reveal novel mechanisms for IL-6 in lung carcinogenesis and for the preventive role of quercetin in the process. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Chronic inflammation is the hallmark of COPD, involving the interplay of a wide variety of cells in the lung microenvironment. Cigarette smoke (CS) induces chronic lung inflammation and is considered a key etiological factor in the development and pathogenesis of COPD. Structural and inflammatory cells in the lung respond to CS exposure by releasing proinflammatory mediators that recruit additional inflammatory immune cells, which collectively contribute to the establishment of a chronic inflammatory microenvironment. Chronic inflammation contributes to lung damage, compromises innate and adaptive immune responses, and facilitates the recurrent episodes of respiratory infection that punctuate and further contribute to the pathological manifestations of the stable disease. A number of studies support the conclusion that immune dysfunction leads to exacerbations and disease severity in COPD. Our group has clearly demonstrated that CS exacerbates lung inflammation and compromises immunity to respiratory pathogens in a mouse model of COPD. We have also investigated the phenotype of immune cells in patients with COPD compared with healthy control subjects and found extensive immune dysfunction due to the presence and functional activity of T regulatory cells, CD4(+)PD-1(+) exhausted effector T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Manipulation of these immunosuppressive networks in COPD could provide a rational strategy to restore functional immune responses, reduce exacerbations, and improve lung function. In this review, we discuss the role of immune dysfunction in COPD that may contribute to recurrent respiratory infections and disease severity. </AbstractText>"}

Smokers with emphysema are at a much higher risk for accelerated loss of lung function, increased cardiovascular morbidity, and development of lung cancer. Recent evidence in human translational studies and animal models suggests that emphysema is associated with activation of specialized antigen-presenting cells and that cigarette smoke can disrupt the induction of immune tolerance in the lungs. Quantitative assessment of cytokines expressed by autoreactive T lymphocytes in response to human lung elastin fragments has shown a strong positive correlation between T helper Type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells' immune responses and emphysema. In search of factors that could reduce the threshold for induction of autoimmune inflammation, we have discovered that cleavage of complement protein 3 (C3) generates bioactive molecules (e.g., C3a) and activates lung antigen-presenting cells. The autocrine and paracrine function of C3a and its receptor are required in T cell-mediated inflammatory responses to cigarette smoke in both human and preclinical models of emphysema. Targeting upstream molecules that reduce the potential for generation of autoreactive T cells could lead to the development of novel therapeutics to prevent progression of emphysema in smokers. </AbstractText>"}

It is commonly accepted that CS contributes to the pathogenesis of oral cancer via reactive free radicals and volatile aldehydes. The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an intracellular receptor involved in proliferation and apoptosis, and has been linked to various types of cancer. The presence of TSPO in human saliva has been linked to oral cancer, and its binding affinity to its ligand is reduced following exposure to CS. In the present study we wished to further investigate the mechanism behind the CS-induced reduction of TSPO binding by exploring the possible mediatory role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and volatile aldehydes in this process. We first analyzed TSPO binding in control saliva and in saliva exposed to CS in the presence and absence of various antioxidants. These experiments found that TSPO binding ability was not reversed by any of the antioxidants added, suggesting that CS exerts its effect on TSPO via mechanisms that do not involve volatile aldehydes and free radicals tested. Next, we analyzed TSPO binding in saliva following addition of exogenous ROS in the form of H2O2. These experiments found that TSPO binding was enhanced due to the treatment, once again showing that the CS-induced TSPO binding reduction is not mediated by this common form of ROS. However, the previously reported CS-induced reduction in salivary TSPO binding together with the role of TSPO in cells and its link to cancer strongly suggest that TSPO has a critical role in the pathogenesis of CS-induced oral cancer. The importance of further elucidating the mechanisms behind it should be emphasized. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Adenocarcinoma, the most commonly diagnosed histologic type of lung cancer, is associated with smoking. Cigarette smoke promotes inflammation on the airways, which might be mediated by Th17 cells. This inflammatory environment may contribute to tumor development. In contrast, some reports indicate that tumors may induce immunosuppressive Treg cells to dampen immune reactivity, supporting tumor growth and progression. Thus, we aimed to analyze whether chronic inflammation or immunosuppression predominates at the systemic level in lung adenocarcinoma patients, and several cytokines and Th17 and Treg cells were studied. Higher proportions of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T-cells were found in smoking control subjects and in lung adenocarcinoma patients compared to nonsmoking control subjects. In addition, lung adenocarcinoma patients increased both plasma concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, and proportions of Latency Associated Peptide (LAP) TGF-β subset of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) Treg cells, which overexpressed LAP TGF-β.

In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province, the lung cancer incidence is among the highest in China, attributed to smoky coal combustion-generated PAH pollution. Here, we screened for abnormal inflammatory factors in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from Xuanwei and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used, and found that a chemokine CXCL13 was overexpressed in 63/70 (90%) of Xuanwei NSCLCs and 44/71 (62%) of smoker and 27/60 (45%) of non-smoker CR patients. CXCL13 overexpression was associated with the region Xuanwei and cigarette smoke. The key carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced CXCL13 production in lung epithelial cells and in mice prior to development of detectable lung cancer. Deficiency in Cxcl13 or its receptor, Cxcr5, significantly attenuated BaP-induced lung cancer in mice, demonstrating CXCL13's critical role in PAH-induced lung carcinogenesis. </AbstractText>"}

The composition of EVs is modified by various triggers to maintain physiological homeostasis. In response to cigarette smoke exposure, the lungs develop emphysema, myofibroblast accumulation and airway remodelling, which contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the lung disease pathogenesis through modified EVs in stress physiology is not understood. Here, we investigated an EV-mediated intercellular communication mechanism between primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and lung fibroblasts (LFs) and discovered that cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced HBEC-derived EVs promote myofibroblast differentiation in LFs. Thorough evaluations of the modified EVs and COPD lung samples showed that cigarette smoke induced relative upregulation of cellular and EV miR-210 expression of bronchial epithelial cells. Using co-culture assays, we showed that HBEC-derived EV miR-210 promotes myofibroblast differentiation in LFs. Surprisingly, we found that miR-210 directly regulates autophagy processes via targeting ATG7, and expression levels of miR-210 are inversely correlated with ATG7 expression in LFs. Importantly, autophagy induction was significantly decreased in LFs from COPD patients, and silencing ATG7 in LFs led to myofibroblast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that CSE triggers the modification of EV components and identify bronchial epithelial cell-derived miR-210 as a paracrine autophagy mediator of myofibroblast differentiation that has potential as a therapeutic target for COPD. Our findings show that stressor exposure changes EV compositions as emerging factors, potentially controlling pathological disorders such as airway remodelling in COPD. </AbstractText>"}

Random-effects meta-analyses were used to compute summary relative risks (SRR). Heterogeneity of results between studies was evaluated using the (I (2)) statistics. For ever active smoking, in 27 prospective studies, the SRR for breast cancer was 1.10 (95 % CI [1.09-1.12]) with no heterogeneity (I (2) = 0 %). In 44 retrospective studies, the SRR was 1.08 (95 % CI [1.02-1.14]) with high heterogeneity (I (2) = 59 %). SRRs for current active smoking were 1.13 (95 % CI [1.09-1.17]) in 27 prospective studies and 1.08 (95 % CI [0.97-1.20]) in 22 retrospective studies. The results were stable across different subgroup analyses, notably pre/post-menopause, alcohol consumption adjustments, including/excluding passive smokers from the referent group.

A growing body of evidence suggests that cigarette smoke impairs the antioxidant defense mechanisms, leading to oxidative damage. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the major antioxidant in the mitochondria, catalyzing the metabolism of superoxide radicals to form hydrogen peroxide. Since the identification of a well-characterized functional polymorphism, Ala-9Val of MnSOD, a number of studies have evaluated the association between Val-9Ala and schizophrenia or cancer. In this study, we hypothesized that the functional polymorphism of MnSOD Ala-9Val was associated with smoking in patients with schizophrenia. This polymorphism was genotyped in 666 chronic male schizophrenia patients (smoker/never-smoker = 507/159) and 660 male controls (smoker/never-smoker = 360/300) using a case-control design. The cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and smoking behaviors were evaluated by clinician-administered questionnaires and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). The results showed no significant differences in MnSOD Ala-9Val genotype and allele distributions between the patients and healthy controls or between smokers and never-smokers in either patients or healthy controls alone. The smokers with the Ala allele started smoking significantly earlier (19.9 ± 5.8 vs. 21.7 ± 6.5 years, P = 0.005) only in patients. These results suggest that the MnSOD Ala-9Val polymorphism may not influence smoking status in a Chinese male schizophrenia population, but may influence the age at which smoking is started among schizophrenia smokers.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Several lines of evidence have suggested that the promoting effect of cigarette smoking extract (CSE) on ESCC is mediated by upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of how CSE stimulates COX-2 expression and facilitates ESCC development are largely unknown. In the present study, we revealed microRNA (miR)-101-3p expression was downregulated upon exposure to low concentration of CSE in Eca109 cancer cells, and suppression of miR-101-3p was required for low CSE-induced cell proliferation, presenting as overexpression of miR-101-3p reversing CSE stimulated cancer cell growth. Luciferase assay revealed that COX-2 was a direct target for miR-101-3p and overexpression of miR-101-3p decreased cellular COX-2 protein expression. Furthermore, we found that COX-2 inhibitor and knockdown of COX-2 by siRNA interference could abolish CSE-induced cell proliferation, indicating that promotion of cancer cell proliferation by low concentration of CSE was dependent on COX-2 activity. Finally, downregulation of miR-101-3p expression and upregulation of COX-2 was found in ESCC specimens from patients with smoking history. Taken together, our findings revealed a new post-transcriptional mechanism by which CSE regulated COX-2 expression to favor cancer cell proliferation, suggesting miR-101-3p as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for smoke-related ESCC. </AbstractText>"}

We investigated functions of STAT3-regulated exosomal miR-21 derived from cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-transformed human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells in the angiogenesis of CSE-induced carcinogenesis. miR-21 levels in serum were higher in smokers than those in non-smokers. The medium from transformed HBE cells promoted miR-21 levels in normal HBE cells and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Transformed cells transferred miR-21 into normal HBE cells via exosomes. Knockdown of STAT3 reduced miR-21 levels in exosomes derived from transformed HBE cells, which blocked the angiogenesis. Exosomes derived from transformed HBE cells elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HBE cells and thereby promoted angiogenesis in HUVEC cells. Inhibition of exosomal miR-21, however, decreased VEGF levels in recipient cells, which blocked exosome-induced angiogenesis. Thus, miR-21 in exosomes leads to STAT3 activation, which increases VEGF levels in recipient cells, a process involved in angiogenesis and malignant transformation of HBE cells. These results, demonstrating the function of exosomal miR-21 from transformed HBE cells, provide a new perspective for intervention strategies to prevent carcinogenesis of lung cancer. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms for lncRNA regulation of genes induced by cigarette smoke. We recently found that, in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, the lncRNA, Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), is associated with changes in the cell cycle caused by cigarette smoke extract (CSE). In the present study, we report that increased expression of HOTAIR and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and tri-methylation of Lys 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), affect cell cycle progression during CSE-induced transformation of HBE cells. Inhibition of HOTAIR and EZH2 by siRNAs attenuated CSE-induced decreases of p21 levels. Further, ChIP assays verified that HOTAIR and EZH2 were needed to maintain the interaction of H3K27me3 with the promoter regions of p21; combined use of a HOTAIR plasmid and EZH2 siRNA supported this observation. Thus, HOTAIR epigenetic silencing of p21 via EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation contributes to changes in the cell cycle induced by CSE. These observations provide further understanding of the regulation of CSE-induced lung carcinogenesis and identify new therapeutic targets. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Heavy smoking and/or drinking is associated with the development of HNSCC. However, HNSCC also occurs in individuals that do not drink or smoke, possibly due to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV-16 has been shown to be closely associated with the occurrence of several types of cancers. However, its role in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of HPV-16 on hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and FaDu cells. Lentiviral vectors were used to establish FaDu cells that expressed the E6 and E7 proteins of HPV-16. We used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays and western blotting to detect and determine the levels of expression for E6-E7 mRNAs and proteins. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), Transwell assays, and flow cytometry were used to assess the effects of HPV-16 E6-E7 on the proliferation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis of FaDu cells. Expression of microRNAs was analyzed by qRT-PCR. We found that the expression levels of HPV-16 E6-E7 were increased in FaDu cells transfected with the lentiviral vector compared with that observed in the control cells. In addition, the rates of apoptosis were decreased in the transfected cells, while proliferation was increased. The average numbers of cells penetrating the Matrigel were significantly higher than those for the controls. We detected miR-363 and miR-15a, and their expression levels were significantly increased in the HPV-16-positive patients and in FaDu cells expressing HPV-16 E6-E7. We found that HPV-16 E6-E7 appeared to inhibit apoptosis, and to increase cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-363 and miR-15a were overexpressed in the hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples infected with HPV-16, and in FaDu cells stably expressing HPV-16 E6-E7. These findings may provide a new clue of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HPV-16-positive hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</AbstractText>"}

At a paper: DMEM ratio of 50 μg/ml, cell viability in both cell lines was normal, as measured by the MTT assay and markers of cytotoxicity, cell cycle, apoptosis and ROS production were normal as measured by quantitative immunofluorescence. Metabolomic analysis was performed on methanol extracts of GC-2 and TM-4 cells. Glutathione metabolism in GC-2 cells, and nucleic acid and ammonia metabolism in TM-4 cells, was changed significantly by THS treatment. RT-PCR analyses of mRNA for enzyme genes Gss and Ggt in GC-2 cells, and TK, SMS and Glna in TM-4 cells reinforced these findings, showing changes in the levels of enzymes involved in the relevant pathways.

Telehealth offers an opportunity to facilitate delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation services as well as incentive-based interventions to low-income populations. However, research is needed on effective strategies for linking smokers to services, how to couple financial incentives with telehealth, and on how to scale this to population-level practice. The current paper evaluates primary implementation and follow-up results of two strategies for connecting low-income, predominantly female smokers to a telephone tobacco quitline (QL). The population-based program consisted of participant-initiated phone contact and two recruitment strategies: (1) direct mail (DM) and (2) opportunistic telephone referrals with connection (ORC). Both strategies offered financial incentives for being connected to the QL, and all QL connections were made by trained patient navigators through a central call center. QL connections occurred for 97% of DM callers (N=870) and 33% of ORC callers (N=4550). Self-reported continuous smoking abstinence (i.e., 30 smoke-free days at seven-month follow-up) was 20% for the DM group and 16% for ORC. These differences between intervention groups remained in ordered logistic regressions adjusting for smoking history and demographic characteristics. Each recruitment strategy had distinct advantages; both successfully connected low-income smokers to cessation services and encouraged quit attempts and continuous smoking abstinence. Future research and population-based programs can utilize financial incentives and both recruitment strategies, building on their relative strengths. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In this study, when CT26 and LL2 mouse cancer cells were treated with 6-nm anatase titanium dioxide NPs (TDNPs) without ultraviolet irradiation, oxidative stress and induction of inflammatory cytokines were observed. Oxidative stress was further increased by disease-associated conditions such as high glucose concentrations and hypoxia. Inhaled or orally administered TDNPs generated granulomatous lesions in the lungs and colon of the rodent models tested, with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were also found in cancer cells treated with gold or carbon black NPs. Treatment of CT26 cells with 10- to 70-nm rutile TDNPs showed that smaller NPs produced more oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines than larger ones did. To avoid diffusion of TDNPs and to minimize toxicity, 10-nm TDNPs were suspended in a collagen gel inserted into a subcutaneous tumor in a CT26 mouse. A single TDNP treatment via this method inhibited tumor growth in a size- and dose-dependent manner, and resulted in lower levels of urinary 8-OHdG when compared to systemically administered TDNPs. These findings suggest that TDNPs might be useful for the local treatment of tumors. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.</CopyrightInformation>"}

While the elevated disease risk in this population has been linked to the usage of smoky (bituminous) coal as compared to smokeless (anthracite) coal, the underlying molecular changes associated with this exposure remains unclear. To understand the physiologic effects of smoky coal exposure, we analyzed the genome-wide gene-expression profiles in buccal epithelial cells collected from healthy, non-smoking female residents of Xuanwei and Fuyuan who burn smoky (n = 26) and smokeless (n = 9) coal. Gene-expression was profiled via microarrays, and changes associated with coal type were correlated to household levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Expression levels of 282 genes were altered with smoky versus smokeless coal exposure (P &lt; 0.005), including the 2-fold increase of proinflammatory IL8 and decrease of proapoptotic CASP3. This signature was more correlated with carcinogenic PAHs (e.g. Benzo[a]pyrene; r = 0.41) than with non-carcinogenic PAHs (e.g. Fluorene; r = 0.08) or PM2.5 (r = 0.05). Genes altered with smoky coal exposure were concordantly enriched with tobacco exposure in previously profiled buccal biopsies of smokers and non-smokers (GSEA, q &lt; 0.05).

Comparing male mortality RRs in the first study (mid-year 1995) versus those in the second study (mid-year 2010), the proportional excess risk among smokers (RR-1) approximately doubled over this 15-year period (urban: RR 1·32 [95% CI 1·24-1·41] vs 1·65 [1·53-1·79]; rural: RR 1·13 [1·09-1·17] vs 1·22 [1·16-1·29]), as did the smoking-attributed fraction of deaths at ages 40-79 years (urban: 17% vs 26%; rural: 9% vs 14%). In the second study, urban male smokers who had started before age 20 years (which is now typical among both urban and rural young men) had twice the never-smoker mortality rate (RR 1·98, 1·79-2·19, approaching Western RRs), with substantial excess mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD RR 9·09, 5·11-16·15), lung cancer (RR 3·78, 2·78-5·14), and ischaemic stroke or ischaemic heart disease (combined RR 2·03, 1·66-2·47). Ex-smokers who had stopped by choice (only 3% of ever-smokers in 1991, but 9% in 2006) had little smoking-attributed risk more than 10 years after stopping.

Due to the crucial role played by smoke-related chronic inflammation in lung carcinogenesis, of special interest are extensively used pharmacological agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We evaluated the ability of aspirin and naproxen, inhibitors of both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase -2, to modulate environmental cigarette smoke (ECS)-induced lung carcinogenesis in A/J mice of both genders. Based on a subchronic toxicity study in 180 postweaning mice, we used 1600 mg/kg diet aspirin and 320 mg/kg diet naproxen. In the tumor chemoprevention study, using 320 mice, exposure to ECS started soon after birth and administration of NSAIDs started after weaning. At 10 weeks of life, the NSAIDs did not affect the presence of occult blood in feces. As assessed in a subset of 40 mice, bulky DNA adducts and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were considerably increased in ECS-exposed mice and, irrespective of gender, both NSAIDs remarkably inhibited these nucleotide alterations. After exposure for 4 months followed by 5 months in filtered air, ECS induced a significant increase in the yield of surface lung tumors, the 43.7% of which were adenomas and the 56.3% were adenocarcinomas. Oct-4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4), a marker of cell stemness, was detected in some adenocarcinoma cells. The NAIDs attenuated the yield of lung tumors, but prevention of ECS-induced lung adenomas was statistically significant only in female mice treated with aspirin, which supports a role for estrogens in ECS-related lung carcinogenesis and highlights the antiestrogenic properties of NSAIDs.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2015.

Acetaldehyde is an environmental pollutant present in tobacco smoke, vehicle exhaust and several food products. Formation of DNA adducts has been regarded as a critical factor in the mechanisms of acetaldehyde mutagenicity and carcinogenesis. Acetaldehyde reacts with 2'-deoxyguanosine in DNA to primarily form N(2)-ethylidene-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-ethylidene-dGuo). The subsequent reaction of N(2)-ethylidene-dGuo with another molecule of acetaldehyde gives rise to 1,N(2)-propano-2´-deoxyguanosine (1,N(2)-propanodGuo). In this study, on-line reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation with tandem mass spectrometry detection was utilized for the accurate quantification of 1,N(2)-propanodGuo and 1,N(2)-etheno-2'-deoxyguanosine (1,N(2)-edGuo) in tissues of rats exposed to 12 ppb, 33 ppb and 96 ppb acetaldehyde in atmospheric air for 50 days. A significant increase in the levels of 1,N(2)-propanodGuo was observed in lung tissues of rats exposed to 12 ppb (7.8/10(8) dGuo); 33 ppb (8.9/10(8) dGuo) and 96 ppb (11.6/10(8) dGuo) compared to controls (4.2/10(8) dGuo). For comparative purposes, the levels of 1,N(2)-etheno-2'-deoxyguanosine (1,N(2)-edGuo), which is produced from a,b-unsaturated aldehydes formed during the lipid peroxidation process were also measured. Elevated levels of 1,N(2)-edGuo were observed only in lung tissues of animals exposed to 96 ppb acetaldehyde. 1,N(2)-propanodGuo also differed quantitatively in liver but not in brain. The monitoring of 1,N(2)-propanodGuo levels in tissues provides important information on acetaldehyde genotoxicity and may contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms associated with acetaldehyde exposure and cancer risk.

Affected patients usually present with features that are characteristic of certain subsites. The larynx is oncologically divided into three: supraglottis, glottis and subglottis. Studies from Western countries have shown that the glottis is the commonest subsite to harbour laryngeal malignancy. However, the supraglottis has been reported to be the commonest subsite in developing countries, including examples in the Indian subcontinent. To our knowledge, no study has been carried out in western Nepal about the epidemiology of laryngeal cancer to date. The purpose of this study was to analyse the epidemiology of laryngeal cancer in relation to its risk factors, age distribution,and preferred subsites and to see if there is any recent change in the subsite wise distribution of laryngeal malignancy in western Nepal.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='MATERIALS AND METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>Patients of all ages and both sexes with suspected laryngeal malignancy were enrolled in the initial study. Detailed history taking and clinical examination was performed to find out the involved subsite in relation to the clinical features. Direct laryngoscopy was performed to further confirm the subsite and to take biopsy from the growth under general anesthesia. After confirmation of malignancy from the biopsy report, patients were finally included in the study. Data were analysed and observations were made to find out the distribution of laryngeal malignancy in different subsites.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>The supraglottic larynx was the commonest subsite to harbor laryngeal malignancy. Smoking and alcohol were found to be the common risk factors.

Supraglottic laryngeal malignancy is the commonest laryngeal malignancy in people who smoke and drink alcohol in Nepal. Avoidance of alcohol use and smoking will be a milestone to reduce the incidence of laryngeal cancers and associated mortality.</AbstractText>"}

Some 700,000 out of 5.4 million deaths due to tobacco use were from India. The era of global modernization has led to an increase in the involvement of women in tobacco consumption in the low income and middle-income countries.

Descriptive epidemiological data on primary lung cancer in women is scarce in Morocco. The aim of this study, conducted in the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, was to describe the epidemiological profiling especially for the smoking status, to determine the most frequent type of lung cancer, and to analyse the survival of Moroccan women with lung cancer diagnosis.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>We found 101 women among 1680 (male and female) cases of lung cancer.

The proportion of adenocarcinoma among never and passive smokers was higher than that of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (69.4 versus 30.6 %), while among women who were smokers, the most frequent histological type was SCC (63.6 %). The Cox regression analysis showed that smoking and passive smoking were not significantly associated with survival [HR: 0.62 (95 % CI 0.31, 1.30); p = 0.19] [HR: 0.56 (95 % CI 0.29, 1.08); p = 0.08] respectively.

Environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, hormonal factors, and viral infection may all play a role in lung cancer in this category. The relation between histological type and tobacco found in our series concurred with those reported in the literature--adenocarcinoma appears to be the most frequent cell type affecting never and passive smokers.

However, the effects of linalool on cigarette smoke (CS)-induced acute lung inflammation have not been reported. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of linalool on CS-induced acute lung inflammation in mice. Linalool was given i.p. to mice 2h before CS exposure daily for five consecutive days. The numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. The production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and MCP-1 were detected by ELISA. The expression of NF-κB was detected by Western blotting. Our results showed that treatment of linalool significantly attenuated CS-induced lung inflammation, coupled with inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and MCP-1 production. Meanwhile, treatment of linalool inhibited CS-induced lung MPO activity and pathological changes. Furthermore, linalool suppressed CS-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that linalool protected against CS-induced lung inflammation through inhibiting CS-induced NF-κB activation. </AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It has been suggested that diabetic people are at increased risk of cognitive decline, since the metabolic and vascular disturbances of the disease affect brain function. Additionally, prolonged exposure to olther potential detrimental factors leads to irreversible cognitive decrements over time due to the aging process. Neurocognitive impairment signifies decreased performance in cognitive domains such as verbal and nonverbal memory, both immediate and delayed memory, executive function, attention, visuospatial and psychomotor performance, information processing speed, semantic knowledge, and language abilities. The aim of the present article is to review the existing literature on the issue of the neurocognitive decline in type 2 diabetes. A literature search of databases was performed, using as keywords 'diabetes' and 'cognitive impairment,' and the reference list of papers so identified were examined, with only English language papers being used. Understanding and preventing diabetes-associated cognitive deficits remains a key priority for future research. It is important to ascertain whether interventions to delay diabetes onset or better control of established disease could prevent some of its adverse effects on cognitive skills.</AbstractText>"}

Currently available fluid biomarkers of AD provide indications of the disease stage; however, these are measured in the cerebrospinal fluid, requiring invasive procedures, which are not applicable at the population level. Thus, gene expression profiling of blood provides a viable alternative as a way to screen individuals at risk of AD. Previous studies have shown that despite the limited permeability of the blood-brain barriers, expression profiles of blood genes can be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of several brain disorders. Here, we propose a new approach to pathway analysis of blood gene expression profiles to classify healthy (control [CTL]), mildly cognitively impaired (mild cognitive impairment [MCI]; preclinical stage of AD), and AD subjects. In the pathway analysis, gene expression data are mapped to pathway scores according to a predefined gene set instead of considering each gene separately. The robustness of the analysis enables detection of weak differences between groups owing to the inherent dimension reduction. Our proposed method for pathway analysis takes advantage of linear discriminant analysis for identifying a linear combination of features best separating groups of subjects within each gene set. The gene expression data were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (batch 1: GSE63060; batch 2: GSE63061). Predefined gene sets for pathway analysis were obtained from the Broad Institute Collection of Curated Pathways. The method achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 for classification of AD versus CTL and 0.80 for classification of mild cognitive impairment versus CTL. These results reveal the good potential of blood-based biomarkers for assisting early diagnosis and disease monitoring of AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we used two different biochars, apple tree branch biochar and maize stalk biochar, and simulated the aging process by using freeze-thaw cycles, dry-wet cycles, and chemical oxidation methods. We investigated the changes in the physicochemical properties and Pb adsorption behavior of the biochars before and after aging treatments. The characterization results showed that the biochar surface structure changed after aging treatments. In general, the specific surface areas (SSAs) of the two biochars increased after chemical oxidation treatment but decreased after the other two treatments. The elemental content analyses indicated a decrease in the C content and increase in O content after artificial aging. In addition, the content of oxygen-containing functional groups in most biochars is increasing after treatment. The increase or decrease in SSA resulted in an increase or decrease in adsorption sites, respectively, thereby enhancing or reducing the adsorption capacity of the biochar. Furthermore, oxygen-containing functional groups enhanced the Pb adsorption capacity of biochar by complexation of free carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups with Pb. Our research indicated that aging can lead to changes in the Pb adsorption capacity of biochar and that these changes vary depending on the type of aging and biochar. Our results will help to provide a better understanding of the changes in physicochemical properties and Pb adsorption capacity of biochar during the aging process in soil toward making full use of biochar for soil amendment.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The morphology of this brain region changes with age. However, there are few quantitative magnetic resonance imaging studies of ERC morphology across the healthy adult lifespan. In this study, we quantified ERC volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature in a large number of subjects spanning seven decades of life. Using structural MRI data from 563 healthy subjects ranging from 19 to 86 years of age, we explored the adult lifespan trajectory of ERC volume, thickness, surface and curvature. ERC volume, thickness, and surface area initially increased with age, reaching a peak at about 32 years, 40 years, and 50 years of age, respectively, after which they decreased with age. ERC volume and surface area were hemispherically leftward asymmetric, whereas ERC thickness was hemispherically rightward asymmetric, with no gender differences. The direction of asymmetry differed across the measures. This informs previous inconsistencies in reports of ERC asymmetry. ERC aging began in mid-adulthood. At this stage of life, it may be important to adopt some strategies to reduce the effects of aging on cognition.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The Bader charge redistribution calculations between different types of silicon carbide and XLPE suggest that SiC fillers have the ability of capturing hot electrons to suppress the accumulation of space charges because of their unsaturated electronic structures and magnetism on the Si- or C-terminated surfaces. The interfacial behavior between SiC and XLPE was investigated based on the physical interaction and chemical reactivity.

We hypothesized that in vivo mechanical loading would further augment the bone formation response in Dkk1 KO mice, comparable to results from Sost KO mice. A cyclic loading protocol was applied to Dkk1 KO mice, wild type mice (WT; Dkk1<sup>+/+</sup>:Wnt3<sup>+/+</sup>), and Wnt3 heterozygote (Wnt3<sup>+/-</sup>; Dkk1<sup>+/+</sup>:Wnt3<sup>+/-</sup>) controls. The left tibiae of 10-week-old female mice were dynamically loaded in vivo with 7N maximum compressive force 5 days/week for 2 weeks. Dkk1 KO bones were significantly stiffer, and so an additional group of Dkk1 KO received 12N maximum compressive force to achieve an equivalent +1200με strain at the mid-diaphysis. MicroCT and bone histomorphometry analyses were subsequently performed. All groups responded to tibial loading with increased mid-diaphyseal bone volume. The largest effect size was in the Dkk1 KO -12N group. Thus, Dkk1 KO animals had enhanced sensitivity to mechanical loading. Increases in cortical bone volume reflected increased periosteal bone formation. Bone volume and formation were not altered between WT and Wnt3<sup>+/-</sup> controls. These data support the concept that agonists of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can act synergistically with load-bearing exercise. Notably, Sost expression decreased with loading in Dkk1 KO and WT mice, independent of genotype. These data suggest that a compensatory downregulation of Sost in Dkk1 KO mice is not likely the primary mechanism for the augmented response to mechanical load.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Crown Copyright © 2019.

Drugs that modulate the cAMP/cGMP levels in the brain might therefore provide new therapeutic options for the treatment of cognitive impairment in aging and elderly with dementia. Phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A), which is highly expressed in the forebrain, is one of the key phosphodiesterase enzymes that hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP. In this study, we investigated the effects of PDE2A inhibition on the cognitive functions associated with aging, such as spatial learning, episodic memory, and attention, in rats with a selective, brain penetrant PDE2A inhibitor, N-{(1S)-1-[3-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-2-methoxyethyl-7-methoxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine-4(1H)-carboxamide (TAK-915). Repeated treatment with TAK-915 (3 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 4 days) significantly reduced escape latency in aged rats in the Morris water maze task compared to the vehicle treatment. In the novel object recognition task, TAK-915 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently attenuated the non-selective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine-induced memory deficits in rats. In addition, oral administration of TAK-915 at 10 mg/kg significantly improved the attentional performance in middle-aged, poorly performing rats in the 5-choice serial reaction time task.

The mechanisms underlying this variation in effect are still not well characterised. Splicing regulatory factors have been implicated in the pathways linked with DR-induced longevity in C. elegans and are associated with lifespan itself in mice and humans. We used qRT-PCR to measure the expression levels of a panel of 16 age- and lifespan-associated splicing regulatory factors in brain, heart and kidney derived from three recombinant inbred strains of mice with variable lifespan responses to short-term (2 months) or long-term (10 months) 40% DR to determine their relationship to DR-induced longevity. We identified 3 patterns of association; i) splicing factors associated with DR alone, ii) splicing factors associated with strain alone or iii) splicing factors associated with both DR and strain. Tissue specific variation was noted in response to short-term or long-term DR, with the majority of effects noted in brain following long-term DR in the positive responder strain TejJ89. Association in heart and kidney were less evident, and occurred following short-term DR. Splicing factors associated with both DR and strain may be mechanistically involved in strain-specific differences in response to DR. We provide here evidence concordant with a role for some splicing factors in the lifespan modulatory effects of DR across different mouse strains and in different tissues.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epigenetic dysfunction is tightly related with various diseases such as cancer and aging related degeneration, potentiating epigenetics modulators as important therapeutics targets. Indeed, inhibitors of histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase have been approved for treating blood tumor malignancies, whereas inhibitors of histone methyltransferase and histone acetyl-lysine recognizer bromodomain are in clinical stage. However, it remains a great challenge to discover potent and selective inhibitors by targeting catalytic site, as the same subfamily of epigenetic enzymes often share high sequence identity and very conserved catalytic core pocket. It is well known that epigenetic modifications are usually carried out by multi-protein complexes, and activation of catalytic subunit is often tightly regulated by other interactive protein component, especially in disease conditions. Therefore, it is not unusual that epigenetic complex machinery may exhibit allosteric regulation site induced by protein-protein interactions. Targeting allosteric site emerges as a compelling alternative strategy to develop epigenetic drugs with enhanced druggability and pharmacological profiles. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the development of allosteric inhibitors for epigenetic complexes through targeting protein-protein interactions. We also summarized the status of clinical applications of those inhibitors.

Although the lifeexpectancy of HIV+ individuals is comparable to that of the uninfectedsubjects paradoxically, there is increased prevalence ofage-associatedcomorbidities such asatherosclerosis, diabetes, osteoporosis &amp; neurological deficits in the context of HIV infection. Drug abuse is a commoncomorbidityofHIV infection andis often associated withincreased neurological complications. Chronic neuroinflammation (abnormal microglial and astrocyte activation) and neuronal synaptodendritic injury are the features of CNS pathology observed inHIV (+) individualsthat are takingcART &amp; that abuse drugs. Neuroinflammation is thedrivingforceunderlying prematureaging associated with HIV (+) infection, cART and drugs of abuse. Autophagy is a highly conserved process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulated autophagyhas been shown to be linked with abnormal immune responses &amp; aging. Recent emerging evidence implicatesthe role ofHIV/HIV proteins, cART, &amp; abused drugsin disrupting theautophagy process in brain cells such as microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. It can thus be envisioned that co-exposure of CNS cells to HIV proteins, cART and/or abused drugs couldhavesynergistic effects on theautophagy process, thereby leading to exaggerated microglial/astrocyte activation, ultimately, promotingthe aging process. Restoration of autophagic functioncould thusprovide an alternative therapeuticstrategy formitigating neuroinflammation &amp; ameliorating the premature aging process. The current review aims to unravel the role of dysregulated autophagy in the context of single or co-exposure of microglia, astrocytes, and neurons to HIV/HIV proteins, drugs of abuse &amp;/or cART and will also discuss the pathways involved in dysregulated autophagy-mediated neuroinflammation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we review the recent evidence highlighting the impact of vascular mineralocorticoid receptor activation in pathological situations, including kidney injury, vascular injury associated with metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, cerebral vascular injury during hypertension, vascular stiffening and aging, pulmonary hypertension, vascular calcification, cardiac remodeling, wound healing, inflammation, thrombosis, and disorders related to angiogenic defects in the eye. The possible mechanisms implicating mineralocorticoid receptor activation in various vascular disorders are discussed. Altogether, recent evidence points towards pharmacological mineralocorticoid receptor inhibition as a strategy to treat diseases in which overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor in endothelial and/or smooth muscle cells may play a pivotal role.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

There is no single solution to combat the complexity of issues concerning the health care system; however, there are potential solutions, such as expanding the role of pharmacists, in efforts to alleviate some stress. Advancing the scope of pharmacy practice with the inclusion of autonomous prescribing authority may enhance access to health care if barriers to pharmacist-provided patient care are removed.

As with any major change, it will take time to implement proper structures and processes, with continuous revisions to address barriers and challenges that may arise. There will be a need for training as well as educating various stakeholders about the changes in the scope of pharmacy practice. Leveraging the experience of states that already have prescriptive authority protocols in place can aid in this endeavor.

Neurology","Date":"Sep 11 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder for which both rare and common genetic variants contribute to disease risk, onset, and progression. Mutations in more than 20 genes have been associated with the disease, most of which are highly penetrant and often cause early onset or atypical symptoms. Although our understanding of the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease has advanced considerably, much remains to be done. Further disease-related common genetic variability remains to be identified and the work in identifying rare risk alleles has only just begun. To date, genome-wide association studies have identified 90 independent risk-associated variants. However, most of them have been identified in patients of European ancestry and we know relatively little of the genetics of Parkinson's disease in other populations. We have a limited understanding of the biological functions of the risk alleles that have been identified, although Parkinson's disease risk variants appear to be in close proximity to known Parkinson's disease genes and lysosomal-related genes. In the past decade, multiple efforts have been made to investigate the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease, and emerging technologies, such as machine learning, single-cell RNA sequencing, and high-throughput screens, will improve our understanding of genetic risk.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic acid while α-linolenic acid is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic acid from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in ω-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier ω-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on lipid metabolism of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease. From the public health viewpoint worldwide the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

Few data are available that quantify feed and water consumption, as well as growth, in healthy versus non-healthy calves-the objective of this study. A database of Holstein calves (&lt;1 wk of age; n = 313) was developed to compare calves that developed diarrhea in the first 21 d after arrival from commercial farms to the research facility versus calves that remained healthy. Individual calf data from 4 experiments included daily intake of milk replacer, free water, electrolyte solution, and starter grain, as well as weekly body weight (BW) and frame measures for 21 d after arrival. Calves with a fecal score of &gt;2 for ≥3 consecutive days over the first 21 d of each experiment were retrospectively classified as diarrheic (DIA; n = 96); the remainder were classified as healthy (HEA; n = 217). Other health issues were minimal. The likelihood of elevated fecal score occurrence and the cumulative number of days with an elevated score were greater for DIA calves than for HEA calves. The initial total protein concentration in blood did not differ between classifications. Cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake (DMI) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves, because DIA calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer. Cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves. As a result, cumulative total DMI was significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves. Cumulative free water intake did not differ between classifications. The DIA calves were more likely to receive electrolyte solution and have more days given electrolyte solution than HEA calves. As a result, total cumulative intake of electrolyte solution was greater in DIA calves than in HEA calves. Cumulative total water intake did not differ between classifications. Initial BW did not differ between classifications; however, a classification × time interaction for BW indicated that HEA calves were heavier than DIA calves and had greater ADG. Significant classification × time interactions for hip height and heart girth revealed that HEA calves had a larger frame size. Gain-feed ratios for both milk replacer intake and total DMI differed between classifications: DIA calves were less feed-efficient than HEA calves. In conclusion, diarrhea in young calves decreases DMI, BW gain, and feed efficiency relative to HEA calves within 21 d of arrival.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

These diseases were selected based on their economic impact. Ketosis, metritis, and retained placenta were scored dichotomously. Mastitis was scored as absent, a single occurrence during the lactation, or more than 1 occurrence. Ketosis and metritis were recorded during the first 21 d after calving, retained placenta during the first 5 d after calving, and mastitis up to 305 d in milk. The effects of herd-year-season, calving age, month of calving, gestation length, and occurrence of dystocia were included in the first-parity analysis models. All effects were significant for metritis and retained placenta. For ketosis, all effects were significant, except for gestation length. For mastitis, only the effects of herd-year-season and calving age were significant. Variance components were computed by the multitrait animal model. The 4 diseases were analyzed jointly based on first-parity records, and each disease was analyzed separately for parities 1 to 3 with the different parities considered separate traits. The 4 disease traits in first parity were also analyzed jointly with the 6 major traits included in the Israeli breeding index: milk, fat, and protein production; somatic cell score; female fertility; and longevity. Heritability was highest for metritis and lowest for mastitis, but all heritabilities were &lt;0.07, similar to previous studies. For all 4 diseases, genetic correlations among the first 3 parities were &gt;0.65, and all residual correlations were &lt;0.07. Selection of herd-years assumed to have more accurate recording of mastitis did not result in higher heritability estimates. Genetic correlations between the disease traits and milk, fat, and protein production were economically unfavorable, while correlations between the disease traits and somatic cell score, female fertility, and longevity were economically favorable. Expected genetic changes in the disease traits after 10 yr of selection with the current Israeli breeding index were all &lt;1%, except for ketosis, which was predicted to increase by 1.5%. Inclusion of these traits in a proposed index with the disease traits constituting 7% of the index would result in only marginal improvements for the disease traits and adversely affect genetic gain for fat and protein production. Thus, inclusion of these traits in the breeding index cannot be justified economically.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Healthy APOE-ε4 carriers display decreased T1w/T2w ratios in extensive regions in a dose-dependent manner. These differences were found to interact with age, suggesting faster changes in individuals with more ε4 alleles. These results obtained with T1w/T2w ratios, confirm the increased vulnerability of WM tracts in APOE-ε4 healthy carriers. Early alterations of myelin content could be the result of the impaired function of the ε4 isoform of the APOE protein in cholesterol transport. These findings help to clarify the possible interactions between the APOE-dependent non-pathological burden and age-related changes potentially at the source of the AD pathological cascade.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

In a group of cognitively normal, 'biomarker-negative' older men and women, we investigated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels and memory measured with the ModRey, a list-learning task designed to assess memory in preclinical and cognitively normal adults.

Polysaccharide (PS) extracted from Ganoderma lucidum exhibits a variety of immunomodulatory activities and has the ability to induce strong immune responses.

Here, PS and inactivated porcine circovirus type II (PCV-II) were encapsulated into Lip as a vaccine and inoculated into mice. The magnitude and kinetics of adjuvant activity were investigated. Polysaccharide-loaded liposomes (Lip-PS) could induce more efficient PCV-II-specific immune responses than other single-component formulations. The Lip-PS group displayed robust and higher titers of PCV-II-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies and IgG subtypes as well as higher cytokine levels, furthermore, splenocytes were activated by Lip-PS. Thus, Lip-PS formulation produced vigorous humoral and cellular immune responses, with a mixed T-helper (Th)1/Th2/Th17 immune response and slight Th1 polarized cellular immune response.

The aquatic environment of the Morris water maze (MWM) implies a stressful condition for mice leading to cognitive performances with presence of other behaviors related to emotionality. This can be critical in models such as the 3xTg-AD mice that exhibit a noticeable BPSD-like profile. The present work is aimed to provide a quantitative (number of episodes and duration) and qualitative (prevalence) analysis of flotation and circling, the most common 'non-searching behaviors' elicited in the MWM. We studied the expression of these behaviors in 6-month-old gold-standard wildtype C57BL/6 mice (genetic background) and 3xTg-AD mice (onset of disease) and when both genotypes were submitted to chronic d-galactose induced accelerated aging. Elicitation of floating and circling was recorded during three standard MWM paradigms: visual perceptual learning, place task for spatial reference memory and a final probe trial for short-term memory. In view of the results, we demonstrate that the index of 'flotation', characteristic of non-transgenic performance, is sensitive (reduction) to accelerated aging and AD. Conversely, circling behavior, characteristic of 3xTg-AD mice, can be an additional tool for evaluating BPSD-like symptoms in AD-models while its index unveils bizarre behavior induced by d-galactose induced aging. These results can be useful in relation to preventive and/or therapeutical interventions targeting AD but they may also be suitable in the evaluation of the potential risk factors in animals with normal aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Osteoporosis is often diagnosed only after patients have a fracture that causes a severe decline in ability to perform activities of daily life. Although the current criterion standard for diagnosing osteoporosis is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), this modality remains less prevalent among general practitioners in geriatric medicine. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of visual inspection of lumbar radiography in detecting bone mineral density (BMD) decline. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical data of 78 patients who underwent both lateral lumbar radiography and DXA. Board-certified radiologists determined the clinical grade of each patient's condition according to the semiquantitative (SQ) method of lumbar fracture assessment. We compared the grades and young adult means of BMD in the lumbar spine and hips as measured using DXA. RESULTS BMD of the femoral neck was significantly lower in patients with severe osteoporosis (grades 2 and 3 as classified using the SQ method) than in those with mild osteoporosis (grades 0 and 1; P&lt;0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the SQ method can help predict the decrease in BMD (young adult mean score of &lt;70%) in the femoral neck with moderate accuracy (sensitivity, 0.621; specificity, 0.829; area under the curve, 0.742). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that lateral lumbar radiography can provide useful information about bone mineral status and can serve as a tool for osteoporosis screening by general practitioners.</AbstractText>"}

To this end, we cultivated human embryonic lung fibroblasts in nutrient solution with or without tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) to establish an inflammaging model in vitro. The cells were preincubated with or without PQQ to determine if PQQ had any anti-inflammaging effect. More senescent cells were detected with the addition of TNF-α than without (P &lt; .01). The ratio of senescent cells to non-senescent cells in the TNF-α group was greater than that in the control group (P &lt; .01).

Differentiation status and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were determined by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and Seahorse assay, respectively. Data are mean ± SEM except Seahorse (mean ± SD); P &lt; 0.05, considered significant. In vitro, statins concentration-dependently de-differentiated the myofibroblasts.

While ToM difficulties appear to abate with age in older autistic populations, this has yet to be explored in the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP). The current study examined ToM performance among younger (n = 49, aged 18-46) and older adults (n = 47, aged 60-91) who were classified as on the BAP (younger n = 18; older n = 21) or not (younger n = 31; older n = 26) using the BAP Questionnaire. ToM was assessed using the ecologically valid Strange Stories Film Task (SSFT) and the dynamic Happé-Frith Triangle Animations task (TA). A 2 × 2 analysis of variance examined the effects of autistic traits (BAP vs. non-BAP) and age (young vs. old). For both SSFT and TA, results showed autistic trait main effects on task performance (non-BAP &gt; BAP). Age main effects were observed for some but not all metrics on TA (younger better than older), with no differences in SSFT. An interaction of autistic traits and age was observed in TA Intentionality, with younger non-BAP and younger BAP performing similarly but older non-BAP performing better than older BAP. Results show that younger and older adults with elevated autistic traits show poorer ToM performance. Despite ToM difficulties being common in later life in the general population, this effect was not observed when using a ToM task designed to reflect real-world scenarios. However, results suggest that autistic traits and age could interact to increase risk for poor ToM performance in older adults who endorse elevated autistic traits.

We assembled this information, in silico, for the human renin gene (REN). We searched for chromatin contacts and boundaries and the locations of super-enhancers that are involved in cell specific differentiation. The REN promoter was connected via RNA polymerase II binding to promoters of 12 neighboring genes on chromosome 1q32.1 over a distance of 762,497 bp. This constitutes a regulatory archipelago. The genes formed 3 topologically associated domains (TADs), as follows: TAD1: ZC3H11A, SNRPE, LINC00303; SOX13; TAD2: ETNK2, REN, KISS1, GOLT1A; TAD3: PLEKHA6, LINC00628, PPP1R15B, PIK3C2B, MDM4. REN in TAD2, was isolated from its neighboring genes in TAD1 and TAD3 by CTCF-binding sites that serve as insulators. TAD1 and TAD3 genes SOX13 and LINC00628 overlapped super-enhancers, known to reside near nodes regulating cell identity, and were co-expressed in various tissues, suggesting co-regulation. REN was also connected with 62 distant genes genome-wide, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene. The findings lead us to invoke the following novel hypothesis. While the REN promoter is isolated from neighboring super-enhancers in most cells by insulators, these insulators break down with cell age to permit the inappropriate expression of REN in non-kidney cells by using the neighboring super-enhancers, resulting in expression in a wider spectrum of tissues, contributing to aging-related immune system dysregulation, cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Research is needed to confirm this hypothesis experimentally.</AbstractText>"}

Failure of the inflammasomes to rapidly clear the insults or restore tissue homeostasis can result in chronic inflammation. Recurring inflammation is also provoked by mutations that cause the constitutive assembly of the components of these protein platforms. Evidence suggests that chronic inflammation is a shared mechanism in bone loss associated with aging, dysregulated metabolism, autoinflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Mechanistically, inflammatory mediators promote bone resorption while suppressing bone formation, an imbalance which over time leads to bone loss and increased fracture risk. Thus, while acute inflammation is important for the maintenance of bone integrity, its chronic state damages this tissue. In this review, we discuss the role of the inflammasomes in inflammation-induced osteolysis.</AbstractText>"}

We tested the hypothesis that ageing influences the scope for phenotypic flexibility in the mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus), an amphibious fish that transitions between two vastly different environments, water and land. We found that older fish (4-6 years old) exhibited marked signs of ageing; older fish were reproductively senescent, had reduced fin regenerative capacity and body condition, and exhibited atrophy of both oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers relative to younger adult fish (1-2 years old). However, age did not affect routine O<sub>2</sub> consumption. We then acclimated adult fish (1-6 years) to water (control) or air for 10 days to assess the scope for phenotypic flexibility in response to terrestrial exposure. In support of our hypothesis, we found that older air-acclimated fish had a diminished scope for gill remodeling relative to younger fish. We also found that older fish exhibited poorer terrestrial locomotor performance relative to younger adult fish, particularly when acclimated to air. Our results indicate that ageing diminishes skeletal muscle integrity and locomotor performance of amphibious fishes, and may, therefore, impair terrestrial foraging ability, predator avoidance, or dispersal across the terrestrial environment. Remarkably, older fish voluntarily left water to a similar degree as younger fish despite the age-related deterioration of traits important for terrestrial life.</AbstractText>"}

Dementia is one of the most-commom neurodegenerative aging diseases, in which inflammation-related Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia. Amyloid accumulation in the brain, which occurs before any clinical presentations, might be the first and key step in the development of AD. However, many clinical trials have attempted to remove amyloid from brains of AD patients, but none has so far been successful. Negatively charged plasmon-activated water (PAW) is created by resonantly illuminated gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs), which reduce the hydrogen-bonded (HB) structure of water. PAW was found to possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, we report on an innovative strategy to retard the progression of AD by the daily consumption of PAW instead of normal deionized (DI) water. APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were treated with PAW or DI water from the age of 5 months for the next 9 months. Encouragingly, compared to DI water-treated mice, mice treated with PAW presented better memory performance on a test of novel object recognition and had a significantly lower amyloid burden according to 18F-florbetapir amyloid-PET and phosphorylated (p)-tau burden according to Western blotting and immunohistochemistry measurements. There were no obvious side effects in PAW-treated mice. Collectively, our findings support that PAW was able to reduce the amyloid and p-tau burden and improve memory in an AD mouse model. However, the protein levels of molecules involved in amyloid metabolism and oligomeric amyloid did not change. We propose that the effects of PAW of reducing the amyloid burden and improving memory function cannot be attributed to synthesis/degradation of amyloid-βprotein but probably in preventing aggregation of amyloid-β proteins or other mechanisms, including anti-inflammation. Further applications of PAW in clinical trials to prevent the progression of AD are being designed.</AbstractText>"}

Centrosome abnormalities are frequently observed in cancer, but little is known of their origin and about pathways affecting centrosome homeostasis. Here we show that autophagy preserves centrosome organization and stability through selective turnover of centriolar satellite components, a process we termed doryphagy. Autophagy targets the satellite organizer PCM1 by interacting with GABARAPs via a C-terminal LIR motif. Accordingly, autophagy deficiency results in accumulation of large abnormal centriolar satellites and a resultant dysregulation of centrosome composition. These alterations have critical impact on centrosome stability and lead to mitotic centrosome fragmentation and unbalanced chromosome segregation. Our findings identify doryphagy as an important centrosome-regulating pathway and bring mechanistic insights to the link between autophagy dysfunction and chromosomal instability. In addition, we highlight the vital role of centriolar satellites in maintaining centrosome integrity.</AbstractText>"}

We recently found that ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO) mice exhibit earlier aging-associated muscle weakness, and that A1-7 alleviates muscle weakness in aging mice. In the present study, we investigated the role of the A1-7-Mas pathway in the effect of ACE2 on physiological aging. Male wild-type, ACE2KO, and Mas knockout (MasKO) mice were subjected to periodical grip strength measurement, followed by administration of A1-7 or vehicle for 4 weeks at 24 months of age. ACE2KO mice exhibited decreased grip strength after 6 months of age, while grip strength of MasKO mice was similar to that of wild-type mice. A1-7 improved grip strength in ACE2KO and wild-type mice, but not in MasKO mice. Muscle fibre size was smaller in ACE2KO mice than that in wild-type and MasKO mice, and increased with A1-7 in ACE2KO and WT mice, but not in MasKO mice. Centrally nucleated fibres (CNFs) and expression of the senescence-associated gene <i>p16INK4a</i> in skeletal muscles were enhanced only in ACE2KO mice and were not altered by A1-7. ACE2KO mice, but not MasKO mice, exhibited thinning of peripheral fat along with increased adipose expression of <i>p16INK4a</i> A1-7 significantly increased bone volume in wild-type and ACE2KO mice, but not in MasKO mice. Our findings suggest that the impact of ACE2 on physiological aging does not depend on the endogenous production of A1-7 by ACE2, while overactivation of the A1-7-Mas pathway could alleviate sarcopenia and osteoporosis in aged mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).

Re-configured INs were hot-spots of differential interactions, whereby MYOD binding to highly constrained sequences at IN boundaries and/or inside INs led to alterations of promoter-enhancer interactions to repress cell-of-origin genes and to activate muscle-specific genes. Functional evidence shows that MYOD-directed re-configuration of chromatin interactions temporally preceded the effect on gene expression and was mediated by direct MYOD-DNA binding.

Stroke results in robust activation of central and peripheral immune responses which contributes to functional outcome. Aging is associated with increased low-grade chronic inflammation known as 'inflammaging' that renders aged males and females more susceptible to poor outcomes after ischemic stroke. Despite the fact that sex differences are well-documented in immunity and inflammation, few studies have focused on sex differences in inflammatory responses after ischemic stroke and even fewer have been performed in the context of aging. The role of T cell responses in ischemic stroke have gained increasing attention over the past decade as data suggest a major role in the pathophysiology/recovery after ischemic injury. T cells offer an attractive therapeutic target due to their relatively delayed infiltration into the ischemic brain. This review will focus on T cell immune responses in ischemic stroke, highlighting studies examining the effects of aging and biological sex.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Psychological symptoms are one potential moderator of MT outcomes, as they occur frequently in MT patients. Therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from a multi-site study which compared MT to simple touch in 380 adults with advanced cancer. We examined whether the presence of depression or baseline psychological symptom frequency moderated outcomes of change in pain, interference of pain, quality of life, 60-second heart and respiratory rates, and physical distress. We found significant main effects of depression and baseline psychological symptom frequency on changes in pain, 60-second heart and respiratory rates, quality of life, and physical distress for both MT and simple touch, but did not find differential responses between groups in moderator analyses. Results imply that psychological interventions could be targeted to patients with cancer who are receiving any type of touch therapy to improve outcomes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few insect GPCRs have been functionally characterized. Here, we cloned the full length of a methuselah-like GPCR gene (Ldmthl1) from the Asian gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. We then characterized the secondary and tertiary structures of Ldmthl1. We also predicted the global structure of this insect GPCR protein which is composed of three major domains. RNA interference of Ldmthl1 resulted in a reduction of gypsy moths' resistance to deltamethrin and suppressed expression of downstream stress-associated genes, such as P450s, glutathione S transferases, and heat shock proteins. The function of Ldmthl1 was further investigated using transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila with overexpression of Ldmthl1 showed significantly longer lifespan than control flies. Taken together, our studies revealed that the physiological functions of Ldmthl1 in L. dispar are associated with longevity and resistance to insecticide stresses. Potentially, Ldmthl1 can be used as a target for new insecticide discovery in order to manage this notorious forest pest.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Relationships between plasma cortisol and the neuroimaging biomarkers were assessed. Across the entire cohort, higher plasma cortisol levels were associated with lower glucose metabolism in lateral and medial parietal regions. Higher plasma cortisol was also related to lower gray matter volume in temporal-parietal-occipital regions and in the hippocampus. There were no significant group differences in these relationships with adjustment for covariates.

Further, foot lesions compromise dairy cow welfare. Despite this knowledge, foot lesions remain a large problem in many dairy herds woldwide. Therefore, there is potential for dairy farmers to make changes to their current management practices of foot lesions. This study used the social-psychology framework, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), to explore dairy farmers' intentions to make improvements to their current management practices of foot lesions in their dairy cows and to identify the underlying behavioral, normative and control beliefs facilitating and constraining this behavior. In accordance with the theoretical framework, Australian dairy farmers were invited to participate in an online questionnaire which included questions regarding intentions, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Fifty-six dairy farmers completed the questionnaire. The overall intention of these dairy farmers to make improvements to their management practices of foot lesions in the next year was moderate. Dairy farmers believed improving their current management practices of foot lesions would improve animal welfare, increase milk production and was worth the cost involved (behavioral beliefs). They indicated that the opinions of consumers, staff, and animal welfare groups were important in their decision to make improvements (normative beliefs). Better equipment and facilities, improved knowledge and training, and a favorable cost-benefit ratio were perceived as factors that would enable dairy farmers to improve their management practices (control beliefs). While all of these beliefs may be considered as potential drivers to facilitate dairy farmers to change their management practices, the behavioral beliefs were identified as the priority beliefs that industry should target in the development of strategies to increase dairy farmer intentions to make improvements to their management practices of foot lesions.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

S1QELs are small molecules that suppress superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production at Complex I without affecting forward electron transport. Their mechanism of action is disputed. To test different mechanistic models, we compared the effects of two inhibitors of Complex I electron transport (piericidin A and rotenone) and two S1QELs from different chemical families on superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production and electron transport by Complex I in isolated mitochondria. Piericidin A and rotenone (and S1QEL1.1 at higher concentrations) prevented superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production from sites I<sub>Q</sub> and I<sub>F</sub> in Complex I by inhibiting reverse electron transport into the complex. S1QELs decreased the potency of electron transport inhibition by piericidin A and rotenone, suggesting that S1QELs bind directly to Complex I. S1QEL2.1 (and S1QEL1.1 at lower concentrations) suppressed site I<sub>Q</sub> without affecting reverse electron transport or site I<sub>F</sub>, showing that sites I<sub>Q</sub> and I<sub>F</sub> are distinct, and that S1QELs do not work simply by decreasing reverse electron transport to site I<sub>F</sub> (or site I<sub>Q</sub>). S1QELs did not affect the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> or the rate of site I<sub>F</sub> driven by reverse electron transport, therefore they do not alter the driving forces for reverse electron transport and that is not how they suppress site I<sub>Q</sub>.

While human WRN has both an exonuclease and helicase domain, Drosophila WRNexo has high genetic and functional homology to only the exonuclease domain of WRN. Like WRN-deficient human cells, Drosophila WRNexo null mutants (WRNexo<sup>Δ</sup>) are sensitive to replication stress, demonstrating mechanistic similarities between these two models.

Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the inflammation in diabetic and hypertensive elderly women, and their association with fat mass. It comprised the evaluation of 144 women aged between 60 and 80 years old, diagnosed with SAH and T2DM, assisted by Family Health Units in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil. According to body mass index (BMI), these women were classified as either eutrophic or overweight. In the eutrophic females, the IL-10 / IL-17A ratio was increased when compared to those overweight. In addition, IL-17 correlated negatively with HDL and positively with total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, VLDL, and glucose in the eutrophic ones, but not in the overweight individuals. IL-10 also showed differences in the correlation pattern observed between the groups, since for this eutrophic cytokine, it presented positive correlation with the waist circumference, waist/height ratio, and negative association with IL-17, while in overweight elderly women, it was not observed such pattern. Hence, this work demonstrates how the amount of fat mass interferes with the balance of cytokines, especially IL-10 and IL-17, and how it may exert an effect on biochemical parameters and risk factors associated with T2DM and SAH.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Symptoms can include night sweats, hot flushes, poor concentration, tiredness, poor memory and lowered confidence. The workplace can exacerbate these symptoms and for some women can influence their decision to stop working earlier than previously intended. The need for support and understanding from managers is crucial and can make a major difference to how a woman deals with her menopause. Many women enter the menopause at the peak of their productive lives. These women have valuable skills, knowledge and experience that employers need to retain, so they should be developing resources to help navigate this normal and natural stage of the ageing process.</AbstractText>"}

This article explores how old wounds get reactivated in current relationships and contribute to the intergenerational transmission of painful legacies and trauma. Building on intergenerational family theory and interpersonal neurobiology, the dynamics of reactivity and pathways for growth are explored. While much of the time the human brain is on autopilot, driven by habits and emotional reactivity, we are capable of bringing prefrontal thoughtfulness and choice to close relationships. Rather than being victims of parents or our past, we can become authors of our own relational life. Interventions are offered to help adult clients 'wake from the spell of childhood,' heal intergenerational wounds, and 'grow up' relationships with family of origin. The damage caused by parent-blaming in therapy is explored and contrasted with Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy's emphasis on rejunctive action and cultivating resources of trustworthiness in intergenerational relationships. The family is considered both in its cultural context-including stressors and resources for resilience-and in its life cycle context. Aging in the intergenerational family is discussed, focusing on ways adult children and their parents can grow and flourish with the challenges at this time of life. Throughout, the theme of relational ethics-how we can live according to our values and 'reach for our best self' in intergenerational relationships-informs the discussion.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Family Process Institute.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the presence of oxidative and electrophilic insults, the thiols of cysteine residues in KEAP1 are modified, and subsequently stabilized NRF2 activates its target genes that are involved in detoxification and cytoprotection. A myriad of recent studies have revealed the broad range of contributions of the KEAP1-NRF2 system to physiological and pathological processes. However, its functions during gametic and embryonic development are still open for investigation. Although oxidative stress is harmful for embryos, Nrf2-/- mutants do not show any apparent morphological abnormalities during development, probably because of the compensatory antioxidant functions of NRF1. It can also be considered that the antioxidant system is essential for protecting germ cells during reproduction. The maturation processes of germ cells in both sexes are affected by Nrf2 mutation. Hence, in this review, we focus on the stress response system related to reproduction and embryonic development through the functions of the KEAP1-NRF2 system.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Our fund of knowledge of the foundational genetics in disease has never been as great. There is a clear path forward to the resolution of the genetic architecture toward a point at which we will saturate the biological understanding of disease through genetics. This understanding continues to provide fundamental insights into disease biology and, with the advent of new data and methodologies, the path from gene to function is becoming clearer and cleaner. In this opinion piece, we discuss progress in the genetics of Parkinson disease. We explore what genetics has revealed thus far in the context of disease biology. We highlight mitophagy/autophagy, dopamine metabolism and the adaptive immune system. We try and link these findings together to give a holistic view of pathogenesis with the underlying theme that disease pathogenesis relates to a failure of damage response pathways. In the 1990s, Parkinson's disease was regarded a non-genetic disorder. Since that time, however, a huge number of Mendelian loci and risk loci have been identified by positional cloning and by genome-wide association studies. In this review, it is not our intent to list each gene and locus and review their identification [Hernandez, D.G., Reed, X. and Singleton, A.B. (2016) Genetics in Parkinson disease: Mendelian versus non-Mendelian inheritance. J. Neurochem., 139 Suppl 1, 59-74] but rather to outline the pathogenetic mechanisms that these analyses are revealing and then, given the large number of loci already identified, to lay out what we hope future analyses may help us understand, both in terms of disease mechanisms and for risk prediction for the syndrome.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Additionally, telomere dysfunction resulting from telomerase gene mutation can lead to premature aging, such as apparent skin atrophy and hair loss. However, the molecular signaling linking telomere dysfunction to skin atrophy remains elusive. Here we show that dysfunctional telomere disrupts BMP/pSmad/P63 signaling, impairing epidermal stem cell specification and differentiation of skin and hair follicles. We find that telomere shortening mediated by Terc loss up-regulates Follistatin (Fst), inhibiting pSmad signaling and down-regulating P63 and epidermal keratins in an ESC differentiation model as well as in adult development of telomere-shortened mice. Mechanistically, short telomeres disrupt PRC2/H3K27me3-mediated repression of Fst.

Two different molecular mechanisms are possible; the Knudson's 'two hits' or the gene haploinsufficiency. Etiology of sporadic breast carcinoma (SBC) is not known, although data support the possible role of the betaretrovirus Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). This study analyzes the presence of MMTV exogenous sequences in two representative groups of HBC and SBC, excluding any contamination by murine and retroviral material and endogenous betaretroviruses. The 30.3% of 56 SBC contained MMTV sequences, against the 4.2% of 47 HBC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Cases positive for viral sequences showed the presence of p14, signal peptide of the MMTV envelope precursor. This result was expected based on the fact that HBCs, having a specific genetic etiology, do not need the action of a carcinogenetic viral agent. Moreover, the striking results obtained by comparing two groups of vastly different tumors represent an additional element of quality control: the distinction between HBC and SBC is so well-defined that results cannot be ascribed to mere coincidence.

Our results demonstrated that knockdown of NF-κB with P65-siRNA can significantly decrease cell apoptosis and the expression of pro-inflammation factors TNF-α and IL-1β in LPS-induced nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). However, the molecular mechanism of NF-κB pathway exerting anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis function remains unclear. Some researchers reported that inhibiting NF-κB pathway can attenuate the catabolic effect by promoting autophagy during inflammatory conditions in rat nucleus pulposus cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that in human NPCs, inhibiting NF-κB pathway may also promote autophagy. Our results indicated that after knockdown of NF-κB, the autophagy was significantly increased and the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR protein markedly decreased, but the level of autophagy was inhibited after treatment with AKT activator SC79, suggesting the involvement of AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy was under autophagy activation. However, both LPS-induced NPCs apoptosis and expression of pro-inflammation factors were further increased by pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). These suggested that inhibiting NF-κB pathway can promote autophagy and decrease apoptosis and inflammation response in LPS-induced NPCs. Meanwhile, autophagy triggered by NF-κB inhibition plays a protective role against apoptosis and inflammation.</AbstractText>"}

Nursing home residents and their family members have unique needs and stand to benefit from using technology empowering them to be more informed and engaged health care consumers. Although there is growing evidence for benefits of patient-facing technologies like electronic patient portals on patient engagement in acute and outpatient settings, little is known about use of this technology in nursing homes.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='OBJECTIVE' NlmCategory='OBJECTIVE'>The purpose of this study was to report findings from a secondary analysis of data from a national nursing home study of information technology (IT) adoption, called IT sophistication. We describe the extent to which nursing homes (n=815) allow residents or their representatives to access technology including electronic health records, patient portals, and health information-exchange systems as well as the ability of the residents or representatives to self-report data directly into the electronic health record.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>We used descriptive statistics and regression techniques to explore relationships between information technology adoption (IT sophistication) and residents' or their representatives' access to technology.

Specifically, the subanalysis explored older adults' experiences with technology support from family members to inform strategies for promoting older adults' engagement with new health technologies. Although the primary analysis of the original study was theoretically driven, this paper reports results from an inductive, open-coding analysis.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='METHODS' NlmCategory='METHODS'>This is a subanalysis of a major code identified unexpectedly from a qualitative study investigating older adults' use experience of a widespread health technology, the patient portal. A total of 24 older patients (≥65 years) with multiple chronic conditions (Charlson Comorbidity Index &gt;2) participated in focus groups conducted at the patients' primary clinic. While conducting the primary theoretically driven analysis, coders utilized an open-coding approach to ensure important ideas not reflected in the theoretical code book were captured. Open coding resulted in 1 code: family support. This subanalysis further categorized family support by who provided tech support, how tech support was offered, and the opinions of older participants about receiving family tech support.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>The participants were not specifically asked about family support, yet themes around family assistance and encouragement for technology emerged from every focus group. Participants repeatedly mentioned that they called their grandchildren and adult children if they needed help with technology. Participants also reported that family members experienced difficulty when teaching technology use. Family members struggled to explain simple technology tasks and were frustrated by the slow teaching process.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>The results suggest that older adults ask their family members, particularly grandchildren, to support them in the use of new technologies. However, family may experience difficulties in providing this support. Older adults will be increasingly expected to use health technologies, and family members may help with tech support. Providers and health systems should consider potential family support and engagement strategies to foster adoption and use among older patients.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>©Jennifer Dickman Portz, Christine Fruhauf, Sheana Bull, Rebecca S Boxer, David B Bekelman, Alejandra Casillas, Kathy Gleason, Elizabeth A Bayliss.

This rapidly increasing number of older adults is placing unprecedented demands on health care systems, warranting the development of new solutions. Although advancements in smart devices and wearables present novel methods for monitoring and improving the health of aging populations, older adults are currently the least likely age group to engage with such technologies. In this commentary, we critically examine the potential for technology-driven data collection and analysis mechanisms to improve our capacity to research, understand, and address the implications of an aging population. Alongside unprecedented opportunities to harness these technologies, there are equally unprecedented challenges. Notably, older adults may experience the first-level digital divide, that is, lack of access to technologies, and/or the second-level digital divide, that is, lack of use/skill, alongside issues with data input and analysis. To harness the benefits of these innovative approaches, we must first engage older adults in a meaningful manner and adjust the framework of smart devices to accommodate the unique physiological and psychological characteristics of the aging populace. Through an informed approach to the development of technologies with older adults, the field can leverage innovation to increase the quality and quantity of life for the expanding population of older adults.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>©Theodore D Cosco, Joseph Firth, Ipsit Vahia, Andrew Sixsmith, John Torous.

We show that most yeast cells arrest in G1 before death with low nuclear levels of Cln3, a key G1 cyclin extremely sensitive to chaperone status. Chaperone availability is seriously compromised in aged cells, and the G1 arrest coincides with massive aggregation of a metastable chaperone-activity reporter. Moreover, G1-cyclin overexpression increases lifespan in a chaperone-dependent manner. As a key prediction of a model integrating autocatalytic protein aggregation and a minimal Start network, enforced protein aggregation causes a severe reduction in lifespan, an effect that is greatly alleviated by increased expression of specific chaperones or cyclin Cln3. Overall, our data show that proteostasis breakdown, by compromising chaperone activity and G1-cyclin function, causes an irreversible arrest in G1, configuring a molecular pathway postulating proteostasis decay as a key contributing effector of cell senescence.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, Moreno et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

With the present research, we investigated adult age differences in the visual span for alphabetic stimuli (i.e., Latin alphabetic letters), as aging effects on span size may make an important contribution to slower reading speeds in older adulthood. <i>Method</i>: A trigram task, in which sets of three letters were displayed randomly at specified locations to the right and left of a central fixation point, was used to estimate the size of the visual span for young (18-30 years) and older (65+years) adults while an eye tracker was used to ensure accurate central fixation during stimulus presentation. Participants also completed tests of visual acuity and visual crowding. <i>Results</i>: There were clear age differences in the size of the visual span. The older adults produced visual spans which were on average 1.2 letters smaller than the spans of young adults. However, both young and older adults produced spans smaller than those previously reported. In addition, span size correlated with measures of both visual acuity and measures of visual crowding. <i>Conclusion</i>: The findings show that the size of the visual span is smaller for older compared to young adults. The age-related reduction in span size is relatively small but may make a significant contribution to reduced parafoveal processing during natural reading so may play a role in the greater difficulty experienced by older adult readers. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of carefully controlling fixation location in visual span experiments.</AbstractText>"}

Western blot analysis showed that the amount of intact plectin was rapidly reduced during the early postmortem aging (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and almost disappeared at day 3. The degraded 240 kDa plectin accumulated fast and was further cleaved after 3 days of aging (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

Loss of microglia homeostatic state is a key feature of brain aging and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of distinct microglia cellular states are largely unclear. Here, we show that NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells, are essential for maintaining the homeostatic microglia state. We developed a highly efficient and selective NG2 glia depletion method using small-molecule inhibitors of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling in cultured brain slices. We found that loss of NG2 glia abolished the homeostatic microglia signature without affecting the disease-associated microglia profiles. Similar findings were also observed in vivo by genetically depleting NG2 glia or conditionally inhibiting NG2 glia PDGF signaling in the adult mouse brain. These data suggest that NG2 glia exert a crucial influence onto microglia cellular states that are relevant to brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, our results provide a powerful, convenient, and selective tool for the investigation of NG2 glia function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

We analyzed survival trends in relation to hospital discharge and examined patient and hospital characteristics associated with survival following ICU care, using a sample of nationwide claims data in Korea from 2002 through 2013. The Korean government implements a compulsory social insurance program that covers the country's entire population, and the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) data from 2002 based on this program were used for this study. The NHIS-NSC is a stratified random sample of 1,025,340 subjects selected from around 46 million Koreans. We evaluated annual survival trends using the Kaplan-Meier test. Analyses of the relationship between survival and patient and hospital characteristics were performed using Cox regression analyses. Employing a multivariate model, variables were selected using the forward selection method to consider the multicollinearity of variables. A total of 32,553 patients admitted to an ICU between 2002 and 2013 were identified among the eligible beneficiaries. The number of patients who had histories of ICU admission steadily increased throughout the study period, and patients older than 80 years constituted a progressively increasing proportion of ICU admissions, from 7.3% in 2002 to 16.9% in 2007 to 23.1% in 2013. The mean number of mechanical equipment items applied consistently increased, while no difference was observed in the trend for overall 1-year survival in patients following ICU treatment across the study period: the 1-year survival rate ranged from 66.7% (year 2003) to 64.2% (year 2010). Advanced age, cancer, renal failure, pneumonia, and influenza were all associated with heightened risk of mortality within 1 year.

We defined three patterns of artificial kidney failure: early (≤ 12 hr), intermediate (&gt; 12-24 hr), and late (&gt; 24 hr) in 35%, 31%, and 34% of circuits, respectively. Mean access pressure in late artificial kidney failure was 7.5 mm Hg (7.1-7.9 mm Hg) less negative than early failing circuits and pressures demonstrated lower variability in such late failing circuits. Access dysfunction, defined as access pressure less than or equal to -200 mm Hg occurred in the first 4 hours in 118 circuits (27%) which had a shorter (median [interquartile range]) life at 12.9 hr [5.5-21.3 hr]) hours than access dysfunction-free circuits (18.8 hr [10.1-33.4 hr]; p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analysis found the first occurrence of access dysfunction (as a time-varying covariate) was independently associated with increased hazard of subsequent failure (hazard ratio, 1.75; 1.36-2.26). Classification and regression tree analysis of summary pressure indices in the first 2 hours confirmed minimum access pressure to be a significant predictor, as well as indices of transmembrane pressure and return pressure.

RC tears are common in individuals older than 60 years and the repair of these tears is amongst the most prevalent of orthopedic procedures. However, most current models of this injury are established in young animals, which may not accurately recapitulate the clinical condition. In this study, we used a murine model of massive RC tears to evaluate age-related muscle degeneration following chronic injury. The expression of the fibro-adipogenic genes encoding collagen type III and leptin was higher in aged RC compared with matched injured young tissue at 2 weeks post-injury, and development of fibrosis was accelerated in aged mice within 5 days post-injury. Furthermore, the synthesis of collagens type I and III and fat tissue accumulation were significantly higher in injured RCs of aged mice. Similar frequency of fibro-adipogenic PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells was measured in non-injured RC of aged and young mice, but PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells contributed to significantly larger fibrotic lesions in aged RCs within 2 weeks post-injury, implying a more robust fibrotic environment in the aged injured muscle. Altogether, these findings demonstrate age-dependent differences in RC response to chronic injury with a more profound fibro-adipogenic change in aged muscles. Clinically, cell therapies for muscular pathologies should not only consider the cell type being transplanted but also the recipient milieu into which these cells are seeded. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, the physicochemical properties of AA are not optimal for skin uptake and the molecule is also unstable, readily undergoing oxidation on exposure to air. The compound 3-o-ethyl-l-ascorbic acid (EA) has been developed as a stable vitamin C derivative and has been used in topical products. The aims of this work were to conduct a comprehensive characterisation of physicochemical properties of EA as well as to investigate the influence of various neat solvents on EA skin delivery. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterise the molecule. The pK<sub>a</sub> of the compound and the partition coefficient logP<sub>(o/w)</sub> were experimentally determined. A new HPLC method for analysis of the molecule was also developed and validated. A number of solvents for topical preparations were selected based on their wide use as excipients in topical formulations, their potential to act as skin penetration enhancers and their favourable safety profiles. The solubility and stability of EA was examined. Skin permeation of the molecule in full thickness porcine skin <i>in vitro</i> was investigated using Franz-type diffusion cells. The melting point, log P<sub>(o/w)</sub> value and pK<sub>a</sub> value of EA were determined to be 114.39 ± 0.5 °C, -1.07 ± 0.03 and 7.72 ± 0.01 respectively. Skin penetration of EA was evident for the following vehicles 1,2 hexanediol (HEX), glycerol (GLY), propylene glycol (PG), 1,2 pentanediol (1-2P), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), propylene glycol monolaurate (PGML) and propylene glycol monocaprylate (PGMC). Skin uptake but no permeation through the skin was observed for Transcutol® (TC) and dipropylene glycol (DiPG), while no penetration was observed for the solvents 1,5 pentanediol (1-5P) and tripropylene glycol (TriPG). The findings of the permeation experiments confirm the potential of simple formulations to deliver EA to the skin. Studies are ongoing to identify complex vehicles for synergistic enhancement of EA skin penetration. To our knowledge this is the first study to conduct a comprehensive characterization of EA and examine its skin uptake and permeation properties in porcine skin.</AbstractText>"}

Individuals apply a word like SPORTS to different instances because they employ different conditions for category membership (vagueness in criteria) or because they differ regarding the extent to which they feel the term can be applied given fixed conditions (vagueness in degree). Three individuals may, for instance, disagree as to whether <i>chess</i> and <i>hiking</i> are SPORTS, because one believes SPORTS are competitive in nature, while the other two require SPORTS to be effortful (vagueness in criteria). On the basis of whether they consider <i>hiking</i> sufficiently effortful or not, the latter two individuals might still disagree as to whether to call it a SPORT (vagueness in degree). We investigated whether there are systematic age-related differences in semantic categorization by analyzing the categorization decisions of 1,868 adults for eight semantic categories with a formal model that allows the two sources of categorization differences to be disentangled. We found that young and older adults assess instances differently with respect to the categorization conditions and that older adults employ a lower threshold for category membership than young adults do. We recommend that these criteria and degree differences are taken into account in studies of age-related semantic processing.</AbstractText>"}

A total of 99 people are required to complete (n = 33/group). Each group will ingest either a treatment or placebo once daily, for 5-days and blood samples will be taken to analyze platelet aggregation. For 14-days preceding the baseline assessment day and for the 5-day period of intervention, participants will have to exclude some foods/beverages from their diet, which are known to affect platelet function. The present study is expected to generate significant information about the effect of tomato pomace extract consumption on platelet function of volunteers.</AbstractText>"}

The literature on management and health outcomes of TW has grown recently with more publication of research. This has coincided with increasing awareness of gender diversity as communities around the world identify and address health disparities among trans people. In this narrative review, we aim to comprehensively summarize health considerations for TW and identify TW-related research areas that will provide answers to remaining unknowns surrounding TW's health. We cover up-to-date information on: (1) feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT); (2) benefits associated with GAHT, particularly quality of life, mental health, breast development and bone health; (3) potential risks associated with GAHT, including cardiovascular disease and infertility; and (4) other health considerations like HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, other tumours, voice therapy, dermatology, the brain and cognition, and aging. Although equally deserving of mention, feminizing gender-affirming surgery, paediatric and adolescent populations, and gender nonbinary individuals are beyond the scope of this review. While much of the data we discuss come from Europe, the creation of a United States transgender cohort has already contributed important retrospective data that are also summarized here. Much remains to be determined regarding health considerations for TW. Patients and providers will benefit from larger and longer prospective studies involving TW, particularly regarding the effects of aging, race and ethnicity, type of hormonal treatment (e.g. different oestrogens, anti-androgens) and routes of administration (e.g. oral, parenteral, transdermal) on all the topics we address.</AbstractText>"}

However, mechanisms by which klotho induces insulin resistance remain to be understood. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate possible interference points of klotho with insulin signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells by focusing on phosphorylation levels of Akt, GSK3β, PFK-fβ3, and GLUT4 translocation. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to the adipocyte-like cells were performed using specific differentiation kit and confirmed by mRNA expression assay of PPARγ using qRT-PCR, and Sudan black staining of lipid droplets. Then cells were co-treated with klotho and insulin. Expression and translocation of GLUT4 mRNA were evaluated using qRT-PCR and Alexa flour 488 conjugated GLUT4 antibody, respectively. P-Akt/Akt, p-GSK3β/GSK3β, and p-PFKfβ3/PFKfβ3 ratios were determined in insulin and klotho/insulin treated cells using western blot. Our result indicated that GLUT4 expression were decreased to 0.72 ± 0.16 fold in insulin treated cells, however it was calculated 1.12 ± 0.25 fold in klotho/insulin treated cells. In addition, klotho prevented GLUT4 membrane translocation by 27.2% in comparison with insulin-treated cells (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

This is pertinent to Indigenous Australians as they are twice as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to examine whether there was an association between maternal adiposity and fetal kidney growth in late gestation (&gt;28 weeks) and kidney function in infants, &lt;2.5 years of age, from the Gomeroi gaaynggal cohort. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was recorded at the first prenatal visit and maternal adiposity indicators (percent body fat and visceral fat area) measured at &gt;28 weeks gestation by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Fetal kidney structure was assessed by ultrasound. Renal function indicators (urinary albumin:creatinine and protein:creatinine) were measured in infants from a spot urine collection from nappies. Multiple linear regression and multi-level mixed effects linear regression models with clustering were used to account for repeated measures of urine. 147 mother-child pairs were examined. Estimated fetal weight (EFW), but not fetal kidney size, was positively associated with maternal adiposity and pre-pregnancy BMI. When adjusted for smoking, combined kidney volume relative to EFW was negatively associated with maternal percentage body fat. Infant kidney function was not influenced by maternal adiposity and pre-pregnancy BMI (n = 84 observations). Current findings show that Indigenous babies born to obese mothers have reduced kidney size relative to EFW. We suggest that these babies are experiencing a degree of glomerular hyperfiltration in utero, and therefore are at risk of developing CKD in later life, especially if their propensity for obesity is maintained. Although no impact on renal function was observed at &lt;2.5 years of age, long-term follow-up of offspring is required to evaluate potential later life impacts.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Using organotypic explants and dissociated SGN cultures, we investigated the influence of PTN on the number of neurons, neurite number and neurite length. PTN significantly increased the number and neurite length of dissociated SGNs. We further verified the expression of important PTN-associated receptors in the SG. mRNA of anaplastic lymphoma kinase, α<sub>v</sub> integrin, β<sub>3</sub> integrin, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ, neuroglycan C, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and syndecan 3 was detected in the inner ear. These results suggest that PTN may be a novel candidate to improve sensorineural hearing loss treatment in the future.</AbstractText>"}

Unfortunately, one of its major side effects is permanent hearing loss. Here, we show that glutathione transferase α4 (GSTA4), a member of the Phase II detoxifying enzyme superfamily, mediates reduction of cisplatin ototoxicity by removing 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the inner ears of female mice. Under cisplatin treatment, loss of Gsta4 results in more profound hearing loss in female mice compared to male mice. Cisplatin stimulates GSTA4 activity in the inner ear of female wild-type, but not male wild-type mice. In female Gsta4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, cisplatin treatment results in increased levels of 4-HNE in cochlear neurons compared to male Gsta4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In CBA/CaJ mice, ovariectomy decreases mRNA expression of Gsta4, and the levels of GSTA4 protein in the inner ears. Thus, our findings suggest that GSTA4-dependent detoxification may play a role in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection.</AbstractText>"}

While senescence-regulated processes have been extensively characterized in leaves, they remain poorly described in roots. Here, we investigated the physiological processes and molecular determinants underlying the senescence of seminal roots in hydroponically grown barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Transcriptome profiling in apical and basal root tissues revealed that several NAC-, WRKY-, and APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factors were upregulated just before the arrest of root elongation, when root cortical cell lysis and nitrate uptake, as well as cytokinin concentrations ceased. At this time point, root abscisic acid levels peaked, suggesting that abscisic acid is involved in root aging-related processes characterized by expression changes of genes involved in oxidative stress responses. This temporal sequence of aging-related processes in roots is highly reminiscent of typical organ senescence, with the exception of evidence for the retranslocation of nutrients from roots. Supported by the identification of senescence-related transcription factors, some of which are not expressed in leaves, our study indicates that roots undergo an intrinsic genetically determined senescence program, predominantly influenced by plant age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This review article is focused on recent scientific advances highlighted in the invited presentations at the meeting, which encompassed the normal and malignant niches supporting hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny. Given the precise focus, it does not discuss other relevant contributions in this field, which have been the scope of other recent reviews. The content covers basic research and possible clinical applications with the major therapeutic angle of utilizing basic knowledge to devise new strategies to target the tumor microenvironment in hematologic cancers. The review is structured in the following sections: (i) regulation of normal hematopoietic stem cell niches during development, adulthood and aging; (ii) metabolic adaptation and reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment; (iii) the key role of inflammation in reshaping the normal microenvironment and driving hematopoietic stem cell proliferation; (iv) current understanding of the tumor microenvironment in different malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes; and (v) the effects of therapies on the microenvironment and some opportunities to target the niche directly in order to improve current treatments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Transcription factors direct the development of hematopoietic cells, such as GATA-1 for erythropoiesis and PU.1 for myelopoiesis. However, recent findings obtained from single-cell analyses raise the question of whether these transcription factors are 'initiators' or just 'executors' of differentiation, leaving the initiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation (i.e. lineage commitment) unclear. While a stochastic process is likely involved in commitment, it cannot fully explain the homeostasis of hematopoiesis nor 'on-demand' hematopoiesis in response to environmental changes. Transcription factors BACH1 and BACH2 may regulate both commitment and on-demand hematopoiesis because they control erythroid-myeloid and lymphoid-myeloid differentiation by repressing the myeloid program, and their activities are repressed in response to infectious and inflammatory conditions. We summarize possible mechanisms of lineage commitment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells suggested by recent findings and discuss the erythroid and lymphoid commitment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, focusing on the gene regulatory network composed of genes encoding key transcription factors. Surprising similarity exists between commitment to erythroid and lymphoid lineages, including repression of the myeloid program by BACH factors. The suggested gene regulatory network of BACH factors sheds light on the myeloid-based model of hematopoiesis. This model will help to understand the tuning of hematopoiesis in higher eukaryotes in the steady-state condition as well as in emergency conditions, the evolutional history of the system, aging and hematopoietic disorders.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Cohesin binding increases at active regulatory elements only during erythroid differentiation. Prior binding of the repressive Ets transcription factor Etv6 predicts cohesin binding at these elements and Etv6 interacts with cohesin at chromatin. Depletion of cohesin severely impairs erythroid differentiation, particularly at Etv6-prebound loci, but augments self-renewal programs. Together with corroborative findings in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patient samples, these data suggest cohesin-mediated alleviation of Etv6 repression is required for dynamic expression at critical erythroid genes during differentiation and how this may be perturbed in myeloid malignancies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Each ejaculate (n = 20) of five buffalo bulls (3-5 years) were divided into six equal fractions and diluted using egg yolk based extender supplemented with different concentrations of sodium alginate and cryopreserved. Frozen-thawed semen samples were evaluated using the CASA, hypo-osmotic swelling test, cervical mucus penetration capacity test, and chlortetracycline fluorescence assay (CTC). Phosphorylation of tyrosine containing proteins and malondialdehyde concentration of sperm membrane were evaluated using immunoblotting and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay respectively. The semen extender's anioxidative capacities were estimated by conducting 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, metal chelating capacity by assessing ferrozine and antibacterial capacity using agar plate methods. Supplementation of sodium alginate in extender improved sperm longevity, plasma membrane integrity as well as capacity to transit through the cervical mucus. Supplementation of extender with sodium alginate minimises the phase transition of sperm membranes and phosphorylation of tyrosine containing proteins during cryopreservation. Malondialdehyde concentration of sperm was less in sodium alginate-treated sperm as compared with control samples. The results indicated that sodium alginate increased antioxidant capacity of semen extender. Supplementation with sodium alginate also improved the metal chelating capacity and antibacterial properties of the extender. In conclusion, supplementation of extender with sodium alginate enhances free radical scavenging, metal reduction and chelating capacities to protect sperm during cryopreservation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The dilemma of AKI as a global health burden lies in the discrepancy between its importance as a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and the unavailability of specific therapies to modify these adverse outcomes. Thus, it is all the more important to focus management on AKI prevention, and when AKI occurs to focus on early recognition and immediate adaption of individualized care. AKI is the result of an inter-relationship between patient susceptibility and determinants of perioperative exposures. Screening for constellations of risk factors along with measurement of novel biomarkers allows for early identification of patients who are susceptible to AKI and to initiate early targeted care. Targeted care involves implementation of a bundle of interventions adapted from a consensus management guideline, and is a strategy with growing evidence of a beneficial effect on patients' short- and long-term outcomes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Le personnel a rapporté que les tournées quotidiennes avec les équipes interprofessionnelles appuyaient la collaboration interprofessionnelle et les soins axés sur le patient.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText>Interprofessional collaboration is understood to improve efficiencies and quality of care but is associated with challenges such as professionals’ differing routines, knowledge, and identities, as well as professional hierarchies and time constraints. Given these challenges, there is limited understanding of how professionals collaborate effectively in providing patient-centred care. This study, with a convergence triangulation mixed-methods study design, explored interprofessional staffs’ perceptions of interprofessional collaboration and patient-centred care when working with hospitalized older adults. Thirty-six staff responded to a survey which included the Patient-Centred Care measure and the Modified Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration; we also interviewed 14 nursing staff. Although all scores suggested a high value was placed on interprofessional collaboration, scores were low related to activities that facilitated team processes. We identified three themes from the data: knowing the patient/family, functional needs, and communication processes. Staff identified daily rounds with interprofessional teams as supportive of interprofessional collaboration and patient-centred-care.</AbstractText>"}

After peripheral nerve injury or neurodegeneration, motor neurons and Schwann cells increase the expression of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> pan-neurotrophin receptor. Even though p75<sup>NTR</sup> targeting has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to delay peripheral neuronal damage progression, the effects of long-term p75<sup>NTR</sup> inhibition at the mature neuromuscular junction have not been elucidated. We performed quantitative neuroanathomical analyses of the neuromuscular junction in p75<sup>NTR</sup> null mice by laser confocal and electron microscopy, which were complemented with electromyography, locomotor tests, and pharmacological intervention studies. Mature neuromuscular synapses of p75<sup>NTR</sup> null mice show impaired postsynaptic organization and ultrastructural complexity, which correlate with altered synaptic function at the levels of nerve activity-induced muscle responses, muscle fiber structure, force production, and locomotor performance. Our results on primary myotubes and denervated muscles indicate that muscle-derived p75<sup>NTR</sup> does not play a major role on postsynaptic organization.

In order to test the validity, Short Disease Perception Scale (SDPS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered together with the ICQ. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to measure the construct validity of the ICQ, and convergent and divergent validities were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. In order to achieve the test-retest reliability of the questionnaire, 81 patients re-applied the questionnaire after two days. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients were calculated to determine the reliability level of the questionnaire. <b>Results</b>: The factor loadings of the ICQ helplessness subscale ranged from 0.784 to 0.853, the acceptance subscale ranged from 0.583 to 0.855, and the perceived benefits subscale ranged from 0.733 to 0.794. Internal consistency coefficients of the ICQ were found α = 0.929 for the helplessness subscale, α = 0.868 for the acceptance subscale, and α = 0.896 for perceived benefits subscale. The results of the analysis showed that there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the initial measurement of helplessness sub-scale and the retest helplessness subscale at 0.697 level (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). A statistically significant positive correlation was determined between the test and the retest of acceptance sub-scale at 0.465 level (<i>p</i> &lt; .05).

Dietary habits constitute the main environmental factor that may accelerate or decelerate this process. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are constituents of dietary products that are consumed daily, such as bread and milk. Although AGEs have been widely regarded as toxic agents, recent studies seem to contradict this view: they either find no adverse effects of AGEs or even attribute beneficial properties to them. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of sugar-derived AGEs on organismal lifespan using as a model the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Exposure to sugar-derived AGEs prolonged the lifespan of wild type animals; this lifespan extension was accompanied by an enhanced pharyngeal pumping rate. We demonstrate that elevation of the pharyngeal pumping rate depends on <i>W06A7.4</i> and <i>eat-4</i> expression, as well as on <i>daf-16</i>, which encodes a FOXO family transcription factor. Our results suggest that sugar-derived AGEs modulate the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> at least in part through transcriptional regulation of pharyngeal pumping throughout the animals' lifespan.</AbstractText>"}

However, whether the expression of HIFs changes with age is unknown. In the present study, the effect of aging on HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α and VEGF expression in the heart and lung of 30 Tibetan sheep that were adapted to hypoxia was evaluated. The 30 sheep were subdivided into groups of 10 animals that were 1, 2 or 6 years of age. Immunohistochemistry for HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α and VEGF revealed that the immunostaining intensity of VEGF protein in the heart and lung was significantly higher than the intensity of immunostaining against the HIFs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein translocated into the nucleus of cardiac muscle cells. However, immunostaining for HIF-3α was restricted to the cytoplasm of the myocardial cells. Immunostaining for HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α and VEGF was detected within alveolar macrophages. The concentration of HIF-1α and HIF-2α was higher in the lung of 1-year-old than 6-year-old sheep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, HIF-3α and VEGF immunostaining was most prominent in the hearts of the oldest sheep. However, when RT-PCR was used to evaluate RNA within the tissues, the expression of all four studied genes was higher in the lung than in the heart in the 1-year-old sheep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, VEGF and HIF-3α gene expression was higher in the heart from 1-year old than 6-year old sheep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). However, in the lung, HIF-1α and HIF-2α gene expression was lower in 1-year old than 6-year old sheep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). We conclude that HIF-3α and VEGF may play be important in how the heart responds to hypoxia. Additionally, HIF-1α and HIF-2α may have a role in the adaptation of the lung to hypoxia. The expression of these proteins in alveolar macrophages suggests a potential role of these cells in the physiological response to hypoxia. These results are useful in understanding how age influences the hypoxia adaption mechanisms of the heart and lung and may help to better understand chronic mountain sickness that is commonly observed in Tibetan people living on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.</AbstractText>"}

Molecular lesions to the mtDNA cause severe metabolic diseases and have been proposed to contribute to the progressive nature of common age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. As a consequence of playing a central role in cellular energy metabolism, mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product of respiration.

Most of the initial Guinier Preston (GP) zones dissolve into the matrix during heat treatment process, while the grain boundary precipitates have no obvious change. The precipitates of the samples after heat treatment mainly consist of high density GP zones due to the natural aging effect, which result in the recovery of micro-hardness. Although heat treatment decreases the mechanical properties of 7N01 aluminum alloy, there is no obvious difference in mechanical properties of the specimens after different heat treatment conditions. The corrosion resistance of heat treatment samples decreases significantly compared with the base metal, which is attributed to enhancing the difference between the potential of the alloy matrix and the grain boundary.</AbstractText>"}

In more recent years, bilingualism has come to be acknowledged not as a trait but as a highly individual experience where the context of use strongly modulates any cognitive effect that ensues from it (cf. van den Noort et al., 2019). In addition, modulating factors have been shown to interact in intricate ways (Pot, Keijzer and de Bot, 2018). Adding to the complexity is the fact that control processes linked to bilingualism are bidirectional-just as language control can influence cognitive control, individual differences in cognitive functioning often predict language learning outcomes and control. Indeed, Hartsuiker (2015) posited the need for a better understanding of cognitive control, language control as well as the transfer process between them. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the bidirectional and individual cognitive, social and linguistic factors in relation to bilingualism and second language learning, with a special focus on older adulthood: (1) we first show the intricate clustering of modulating individual factors as deterministic of cognitive outcomes of bilingual experiences at the older end of the lifespan; (2) we then present a meta-study of work in the emergent field of third-age language learning, the results of which are related to lifelong bilingualism; (3) objectives (1) and (2) are then combined to result in a blueprint for future work relating cognitive and social individual differences to bilingual linguistic outcomes and vice versa in the context of third-age language learning.</AbstractText>"}

To achieve excellent microstructure stability and mechanical properties, the control of precipitation particles is critical for application of FeCrAl-based alloys. In this paper, the effect of thermomechanical processing on the microstructure and precipitation behavior of hot-rolled FeCrAl alloy plates was examined. After hot rolling, the FeCrAl alloy plates had typical deformation textures. The rolling direction (RD) orientation gradually rotated from &lt;100&gt; to &lt;110&gt; along with increasing reduction. Shear bands and cell structures were formed in the matrix, and the former acted as preferable nucleation sites for crystallization. Improved deformation helped to produce strain-induced precipitation. The plate with 83% reduction had the most homogeneous and finest precipitation particles. Identification results by TEM indicated that the Laves precipitation was of the Fe<sub>2</sub>Nb-type crystal structure type, with impurities including Mo, Cr, and Si. The plate with uniform Laves particles displayed favorable heat stability after a long period of aging at 800 °C. The microstructure evolution of the aged sample was also observed.

In a second stage, the auto-seeds aggregate into hundreds-of-nm-large meso-structures by their mutual shadowing of the grazing Ti flux for local oxidation.

The process of atherogenesis itself is characterized by infiltration and retention of cholesterol-containing blood-derived low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the intimal layer of the arterial wall, where the particles become modified and ingested by macrophages, resulting in the formation of cholesterol-filled foam cells. Provided the blood-derived high-density lipoproteins (HDL) particles are able to efficiently carry cholesterol from the foam cells back to the circulation, the early lesions may stay stable or even disappear. However, the modified LDL particles also trigger a permanent local inflammatory reaction characterized by the presence of activated macrophages, T cells, and mast cells, which drive lesion progression. Then, the HDL particles become modified and unable to remove cholesterol from the foam cells. Ultimately, the aging foam cells die and form a necrotic lipid core. In such advanced lesions, the lipid core is separated from the circulating blood by a collagenous cap, which may become thin and fragile and susceptible to rupture, so causing an acute atherothrombotic event. Regarding the potential contribution of mast cells in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions, immunohistochemical studies in autopsied human subjects and studies in cell culture systems and in atherosclerotic mouse models have collectively provided evidence that the compounds released by activated mast cells may promote atherogenesis at various steps along the path of lesion development. This review focuses on the presence of activated mast cells in human atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, some of the molecular mechanisms potentially governing activation and effector functions of mast cells in such lesions are presented and discussed.</AbstractText>"}

However, since the prevalence of a recurring condition is determined by its incidence and the number and duration of episodes, it is important to have valid incidence estimates and to conduct aetiological studies on incidence measures to untangle risk factors of the occurrence of shoulder pain from those affecting the duration and number of episodes . In this systematic review, we sought to estimate the incidence of shoulder pain in ageing adults along with its associated factors. This work could lead to better interventions to prevent shoulder pain in older individuals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.</CopyrightInformation>"}

However, whether plasma NFL has the same predictive roles in sporadic AD is still unclear. In this study, 243 cognitively normal (CN) participants from the ADNI database were divided into two subgroups (CN- and CN+) according to CSF Aβ or AV45-PET. Associations of baseline plasma NFL concentrations or rate of change in plasma NFL with longitudinal data on other biomarkers were tested by multivariate linear mixed effects models (LMEMs). Results showed that plasma NFL concentration and its rate of change were already abnormally high in the preclinical phase of AD. Plasma NFL was associated with three core AD-related biomarkers in preclinical phase. Baseline plasma NFL, but not its rate of change, played predictive roles in both cognitive decline (β = -0.0349, p = 0.0274) and hippocampal atrophy (β = -0.0351, p = 0.0088), especially for preclinical AD participants. In summary, these results indicated that baseline plasma NFL, but not its rate of change, may be a valuable noninvasive tool to assess neurodegeneration and predict longitudinal disease progression in preclinical AD individuals.</AbstractText>"}

The elucidation of the putative genes and pathways underlying vascular aging likely provides useful insights into vascular diseases at advanced ages. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis is the key to describing genetic interactions between molecular regulators and their target gene transcriptionally changed during vascular aging.<b>Results:</b> A total of 469 differentially expressed genes were parsed into 6 modules. Among the incorporated sample traits, the most significant module related to vascular aging was associated with triglyceride and enriched with biological terms like proteolysis, blood circulation, and circulatory system process. The module associated with triglyceride was preserved in an independent microarray dataset, indicating the robustness of the identified vascular aging-related subnetwork. Additionally, Enpp5, Fez1, Kif1a, F3, H2-Q7, and their interacting miRNAs mmu-miR-449a, mmu-miR-449c, mmu-miR-34c, mmu-miR-34b-5p, mmu-miR-15a, and mmu-let-7, exhibited the most connectivity with external lipid-related traits.

These nominal differentially expressed genes were subjected to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis. A network-driven integrative analysis with microRNAs and transcription factors was performed to define significant modules and underlying regulatory pathways associated with vascular aging, and module preservation test was conducted to validate the age-related modules based on an independent microarray gene expression dataset in mice aorta samples including three 32-week old wild-type mice (around 6-month old) and three 78-week old wild-type mice (around 20-month old). Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction analyses were conducted to determine the hub genes as potential biomarkers in the progress of vascular aging. The hub genes were further validated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in aorta samples from 20 young (6-month old) mice and 20 old (20-month old) mice.</AbstractText>"}

Short single-stranded DNAs, called oligonucleotides (oligos), have been designed and synthesized to store digital data. Previous works designed the oligos with a pair of primer binding sites (PBSs) (each with a length of around 200) attached at the two ends of each basic readable data block. The addition of PBSs decreases the data density significantly because in the current DNA synthesis, the maximum length of a synthesized oligo in good quality is around 200. Furthermore, the maximum homopolymer run allowed by the existing experiments has been reported to be 3 nucleotides. In this work, to increase the data density, we have devised and tested an oligo design for DNA-based storage with the basic readable data block appended by a single PBS at one end only, while allowing the maximum homopolymer run to be increased to 4. We also present an oligo assembly algorithm that can reconstruct oligos with a single PBS from the error-prone raw readouts obtained from the sequencing process. We have conducted a wet lab experiment to validate the proposed design, where we tested with 398KB of data stored into 10,750 oligos. The experimental results show that it is possible to recover over 99% of the oligo sequences without error, which proves that one PBS is sufficient for implementing a DNA-based data storage system with maximum homopolymer run relaxed to 4. The use of single PBS leads to a significant data density gain from 14.3% to 140.2% over the existing short-strand DNA data storage schemes by reserving more nucleotides for storing information bits.</AbstractText>"}

Poultry litter biochar, with lowest surface area (3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and largest pore diameter (29 nm), showed the highest NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> adsorption capacity (0.34 mg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>), while charcoal-based activated carbon, with the highest surface area (1133 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and small pore diameter (6 nm), had the least NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> adsorption capacity (0.09 mg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>). The value of Freundlich isotherm constant 'n' was &gt;1 for all tested carbon materials indicating chemisorption as the dominant sorption mechanism. Aging of the carbon surface resulted in 30% increase in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> retention. Surface chemical properties that most influenced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> chemisorption on to carbon materials were found to be acidic surface functional groups (ASFGs), elemental composition, ash content, and pH. The optimal conditions for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> adsorption, regardless of type and source of carbon materials, were solution pH of 8, a high amount of ash content, and carboxyl, carbonyl, and phenolic functional groups. Evaluation of CEC and ASFGs indicated that CEC and ASFGs are not equivalent terms. Through this study, conducted on carbon adsorbents derived from different sources, with different surface physical and chemical properties, we established that ASFGs, and not CEC, play a critical role in ammonium chemisorption on carbon materials.

This ability is affected by the progressive cognitive decline observed in aging. The aims of this study were to shed light on the neural spectral dynamics involved in interference control and to investigate age-dependent differences in these dynamics. For these reasons two samples of participants of different ages (23 younger and 20 older adults, age range = [18 35] and [66 82], respectively) were recruited and administered a spatial Stroop task while recording electroencephalographic activity. Scalp- and source-based time-frequency analyses revealed a main role of theta and beta frequencies in interference control. Specifically, for the theta band, we found age-dependent differences both for early event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) Stroop effects at the source level - which involved dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices - and for related brain-behaviour correlations. This ERSP Stroop effect in theta was greatly reduced in magnitude in the older group and, differently from what observed in younger participants, it was not correlated with behavioural performance. These results suggest an age-dependent impairment of the theta-related mechanism signalling the need of cognitive control, in line with existing findings. We also found age-related differences in ERSP and source spectral activity involving beta frequencies. Indeed, younger participants showed a specific ERSP Stroop effect in beta - with the main involvement of left prefrontal cortex - whereas the pattern of older participants was delayed in time and spread bilaterally over the scalp. This study shows clear age-related differences in the neural spectral correlates of cognitive control. These findings open new questions about the causal involvement of specific oscillations in different cognitive processes and may inspire future interventions against age-related cognitive decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We recently showed that exposure to neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ1-42) oligomers can readily induce a senescence phenotype in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). In the present work, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to further characterize the morphological properties such as cell membrane roughness and cell height and nanomechanical properties such as Young's modulus of the membrane (membrane stiffness) and adhesion resulting from the interaction between AFM tip and cell membrane in Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced senescent human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Morphological imaging studies showed a flatter and spread-out nucleus in the senescent HBMECs, both characteristic features of a senescent phenotype. Furthermore, the mean cell body roughness and mean cell height were lower in senescent HBMECs compared to untreated normal HBMECs. We also observed increased stiffness and alterations in the adhesion properties in Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced senescent endothelial cells compared to the untreated normal HBMECs suggesting dynamic reorganization of cell membrane. We then show that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) knockdown or overexpression of Rho GTPase Rac 1 in the endothelial cells inhibited senescence and reversed these nanomechanical alterations, confirming a direct role of these pathways in the senescent brain endothelial cells.

We used a target perturbation paradigm and manipulated the time at which a target perturbation occurred during the reach to investigate how healthy ageing impacts sensorimotor control. We measured how the latency of the correction and the magnitude of the corrective response changed with perturbation time and quantified the difference across groups using a percentage difference measure. For both groups, online corrections to early perturbations were more easily accounted for than those to late perturbations, despite late perturbations eliciting faster correction latencies. While there was no group difference in accuracy, older participants were slower overall and produced a correction to a change in target location proportionally less often despite similar correction latencies. We speculate that the differences in the time during the reach that the correction is first identified may explain the differences in correction latencies observed between the perturbation time conditions.</AbstractText>"}

These cases either required a repeat registration if the error was caught early, or the errors were realized on postoperative imaging when the x-ray did not match the preoperative plan. Subsequently, we developed an algorithm to ensure accurate registration and implemented its use on the next 100 cases, again reviewing the intraoperative case data and postoperative x-rays for any errors.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='RESULTS' NlmCategory='RESULTS'>Initial analysis revealed that 87 of the first 100 cases were correctly registered, where postoperative acetabular cup position matched the plan on first attempt. Of the remaining 13 cases that had a registration error, eight cases were identified intra-operatively and re-registered. There were five cases where the postoperative x-ray did not match the plan despite a 'good' registration. For incorrectly registered cases (N = 13), seven of 13 were found to exhibit a type I error (initial registration), while six of 13 demonstrated a type II error (fine point registration). Following the implementation of our registration algorithm, we were able to decrease the discrepancy between the preoperative plan (planning) and the postoperative x-rays (execution) from 13% to 0% of cases.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSION' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>In this study, we present a detailed method to examine registration errors during robotic-navigated THA with MAKOplasty®. From this analysis, we were able to develop a successful algorithm that allows the surgeon to ensure correct registration and ultimately a postoperative x-ray that matches the preoperative plan. Our algorithm presents a principled approach that provides the surgeon and patient confidence in the safety and efficacy a roboticassisted total hip replacement.</AbstractText>"}

Neural factors contribute to this adaptation, but the role of the corticospinal pathway remains unclear. Twelve young (27±5 yrs) and eleven older adults (66±4 yrs) performed two bouts of 60 maximal lengthening dorsiflexions two weeks apart. Neuromuscular responses were measured pre, immediately-post and at 24- and 72-hours following both bouts. The initial bout resulted in prolonged reductions in maximal voluntary torque (MVC; immediately post-exercise onwards, p&lt;0.001) and increased creatine kinase (from 24-hours onwards, p=0.001), with both responses being attenuated following the second bout (p&lt;0.015), demonstrating adaptation. Smaller reductions in MVC following both bouts occurred in older adults (p=0.005). Intracortical facilitation showed no changes (p≥0.245). Motor evoked potentials increased 24- and 72-hours post-exercise in young (p≤0.038). Torque variability (p≤0.041) and H-reflex size (p=0.024) increased, whilst intracortical inhibition (SICI; p=0.019) and the silent period duration (SP) decreased (p=0.001) in both groups immediately post-exercise. The SP decrease was smaller following the second bout (p=0.021), and there was an association between the change in SICI and reduction in MVC 24-hours post-exercise in young adults (R=-0.47, p=0.036). Changes in neurophysiological responses were mostly limited to immediately post-exercise, suggesting a modest role in adaptation. In young, neural inhibitory changes are linked to the extent of MVC reduction, possibly mediated by the muscle damage-related afferent feedback. Older adults incurred less muscle damage, which has implications for exercise prescription.</AbstractText>"}

Patients were a mean (range) age of 71.5 years (64 to 87). The average size of the flaps was 30 cm (range 12 to 64 cm). The reverse sural artery flap was indicated when the skin could not be closed primarily and there was not a suitable vascularized bed of tissue for a split-thickness skin graft. All patients underwent a wide-based pedicle (3 cm to 4 cm), reverse sural artery fasciocutaneous flap with all but one completed in a 'flap delay' manner, between 2 to 7 days, and without the use of microsurgery or doppler. Thirteen flaps were done to cover wounds that occurred over fractures while three were performed to cover chronic wounds.

A total of five additional procedures were performed in five patients. Although the flap ultimately healed, an 87-year-old patient with partial flap necrosis ultimately elected for below-knee amputation for a persistent tibial infected nonunion. Another patient, despite a healed flap, eventually underwent a below-knee amputation 3 years later for a chronic osteomyelitis present before undergoing the reverse sural flap. One patient developed a pseudomonal infection of their Gustillo-Anderson IIIB open tibia fracture, resulting in a surgical procedure for débridement, after which the flap healed.

No patients underwent further coverage procedures.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='CONCLUSIONS' NlmCategory='CONCLUSIONS'>In this small series, we found fewer complications than have been observed in prior studies, despite our series consisting solely of higher-risk, older patients. We believe this may have been attributable to the period of delay before placing the flap, which has been previously associated with higher flap survival and which allows for an extra recipient-site débridement. We believe this procedure can be performed by appropriately trained orthopaedic surgeons because it does not need microsurgery.</AbstractText>   <AbstractText Label='LEVEL OF EVIDENCE' NlmCategory='METHODS'>Level IV, therapeutic study.</AbstractText>"}

Through frequent interactions, romantic partners are thought to continuously exchange, influence, and respond to one another's emotions, leading their feelings to become closely aligned over time. Although prior research has shown that such emotional interdependence can arise in couples, no research to date has comprehensively investigated its occurrence, degree, consistency and correlates. Across 3 different studies, we examined whether and to what extent couples indeed show interpersonal emotional connections (compared to pseudocouples). Additionally, we investigated its consistency and moderating factors, by examining emotional interdependence across different types of emotions (negative vs. positive vs. emotional extremity), timescales (second-to-second vs. daily life), and situational contexts (supportive vs. conflictual), and by inspecting associations with indicators of relationship closeness (relationship longevity, cohabitation status, commitment, and closeness in terms of including the other in the self). The findings show limited evidence for emotional interdependence. The overall mean level of interdependence was significantly larger than that of randomly composed couples, but only a minority of the couples demonstrated emotional interdependence to a greater extent than these pseudocouples. Moreover, the degree to which couples exhibited emotional interdependence showed little consistency across timescales and contexts, and was not clearly associated with relationship closeness. We discuss potential implications for the field of interpersonal emotion dynamics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).</AbstractText>"}

The aim was to review the literature on undertaking and providing continuing healthcare in terms of workforce roles, education and training, and competencies. A literature search was undertaken to identify relevant literature on continuing healthcare. Primary searching of electronic internal databases and indices at the Royal College of Nursing and King's College London was used, alongside a further database search and hand searching. A narrative synthesis of the literature was used to synthesise the findings, and a thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes from the literature. The literature search identified 100 articles, of which 84 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or provided insufficient details in the abstract. A total of 18 articles were included and examined in detail. Four themes were identified in the literature: complexity of care in transitioning care from hospital to home; different care models; importance of education of healthcare professionals; and role of continuing healthcare. Healthcare professionals - including nurses - should receive further training in caring for older people, especially in relation to continuing healthcare.

However, surprisingly little is known about the delayed effect of professional physical training performed at a young age on endothelial function and arterial stiffness in aging athletes. The present study aimed to assess the impact of long-lasting professional physical training (endurance and sprint) performed at a young age on the endothelial function and arterial stiffness reported in older age in relation to glycocalyx injury, prostacyclin and nitric oxide production, inflammation, basal blood lipid profile, and glucose homeostasis. Methods and Results This study involved 94 male subjects with varied training backgrounds, including young athletes (mean age ∼25 years), older former high class athletes (mean age ∼60 years), and aged-matched untrained control groups. Aging increased arterial stiffness, as reflected by an enhancement in pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and stiffness index (<i>P</i>&lt;10<sup>-4</sup>), as well as decreased endothelial function, as judged by the attenuation of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in the brachial artery (<i>P</i>=0.03). Surprisingly, no effect of the training performed at a young age on endothelial function and arterial stiffness was observed in the former athletes. Moreover, no effect of training performed at a young age (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05) on blood lipid profile, markers of inflammation, and glycocalyx shedding were observed in the former athletes. Conclusions Our study clearly shows that aging, but not physical training history, represents the main contributing factor responsible for decline in endothelial function and increase in arterial stiffness in former athletes.</AbstractText>"}

Anxiety was measured using the trait anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Sleep efficiency was measured using one-week of sleep diary data. Two executive functions, cognitive flexibility and inductive reasoning, were measured using the Trail-Making Test and Letter Series task, respectively. SPSS PROCESS macro software version 2 was used to assess the moderating role of sleep efficiency in the relationship between anxiety and executive functions. <b>Results:</b> Sleep significantly moderated the relationship between anxiety and inductive reasoning. Among middle-aged and older adults with high anxiety, those with good sleep efficiency displayed significantly better inductive reasoning than those with poor sleep efficiency after controlling for age, gender, and education (Δ<i>R<sup>2</sup> =</i> .05<i>, p</i> = .017). Sleep efficiency did not significantly moderate the relationship between anxiety and cognitive flexibility. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sleep efficiency weakened the association between anxiety and inductive reasoning in middle-aged and older adults. Evidence from the study suggests better sleep may limit the negative effects of anxiety on executive functions in mid-to-late life. Further research is needed to elucidate the impact of anxiety and sleep on executive functions in clinical populations with anxiety.</AbstractText>"}

It is shown that age-related changes in the composition and properties of mixed saliva and the peculiarities of its microcrystallization are due not only to the aging process, but also to concomitant chronic diseases. As you age, with a decrease in salivation in the oral fluid is determined by increasing the total protein content, reducing the Ca/P ratio, as well as increasing its viscosity. Age dynamics of microcrystallization of oral fluid in healthy adults was revealed. At young and middle age, types I and IIA of mixed saliva microcrystallization are more common at the length of the main axes of dendritic crystals of oral fluid equal, respectively, to 802,6±79,3 µm and 792,2±98,7 µm. In persons of older age groups without clear clinical manifestations of chronic diseases, IIB and IIC microcrystallization of oral fluid are more common with a decrease in the length of the main axes of dendritic crystals, respectively, to 618±77,3 µm and 581,4±69,9 µm. In the presence of clinically expressed psychosomatic pathology in elderly and senile people, the second and third types of microcrystallization of oral fluid are more common with a significant reduction in the length of the main axes of dendritic crystals of oral fluid to 413,2±94,6 µm.</AbstractText>"}

However, in the literature there are practically no publications on the study of the relationship of the features of higher nervous activity, in particular, adaptive behavior, in healthy individuals with the risk of developing age-related dysfunction of the pancreatic islet apparatus (PIA). The purpose of this study was to investigate features of the functioning of the PIA during aging in individuals with normal standard behavior (SB), as well as anxiety- and depressive-like behavior (DAB) in experiments on nonhuman primates. 76 physically healthy young mature and old female rhesus monkeys with SB and DAB were used in the experiments. Old animals were divided into subgroups with normal (NW) and excess (EW) body weight. All young animals were characterized by NW. The function of PIA was assessed using a glucose tolerance test. Intergroup differences in the functioning of the PIA in young animals were revealed, which were characterized by signs of impaired early insulin response, apparently due to a decrease in the sensitivity of β-cells of the pancreas to glucose. With aging, the function of the PIA was damaged in all animals, but the features of its changes depended on both the affiliation to a particular behavioral group and the animal's body weight. During aging in animals with SB, the development of relative insulin resistance of peripheral tissues was observed, accompanied by impaired glucose tolerance and a compensatory increase in the secretory activity of the PIA, which were more pronounced in animals with EW. Age-related dysfunction of the PIA in animals with DAB and NW was similar with age-related changes in the PIA function in animals with SB and NW. At the same time, with aging, animals with DAB and EW showed a more significant peak concentration of glucose than that of old animals with SB and EW, accompanied by a minimum «disappearance» rate of glucose from the circulation and significantly lower insulin secretion than this in animals with SB and EW. Thus, age-related dysfunctions of the PIA in primates with SB and DAB are unidirectional with the development of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, which, however, in old animals with DAB and EW are accompanied by exhaustion of the PIA function, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.</AbstractText>"}

MII oocytes pools obtained by single animals were deprived of cumulus cells and used to extract total RNA including miRNAs. TaqMan™ Rodent MicroRNA A Array v2.0 was used to analyze the miRNAs expression profile. The biological functions and the functional networks of the identified up- and downregulated miRNAs were analyzed by ingenuity pathway analysis software. The gene expression of deregulated-miRNAs targets was evaluated. For the first time, the global miRNAs changes in mouse oocyte in response to cigarette smoke exposure were disclosed. Our results revealed significant modulation of miRNAs mainly involved in inflammatory processes, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. miRNAs expression was altered in a time-dependent manner. Smoke exposure induced an early downregulation of Dicer1. Transcriptional alterations of the modulated miRNAs major targets, estrogen receptor 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, and tumor protein 53, as well as that of other key regulatory genes, were evidenced. Cigarette smoke represents a stimulus able to alter miRNAs pattern in mouse oocyte.

Overall, abnormal or delayed development of key frontal executive-control regions may predispose youth to binge drink. These abnormalities appear to be further exacerbated by the uptake of binge drinking, in addition to alcohol-related neural aberrations in reward-seeking and incentive salience regions, indexed by cognitive deficits and maladaptive alcohol associations. A meta-analysis of neuropsychological correlates identified that binge drinking in youth was associated with a small overall neurocognitive deficit (g = -0.26) and specific deficits in decision-making (g = -1.70), and inhibition (g = -0.39).

Our study aimed to compare the clinical and microbiological efficacy of cefoxitin (FOX) and carbapenems (CP) in febrile M-UTI due to ESBL-Ec (F-M-UTI). We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with F-M-UTI treated with FOX or CP as definitive therapy, between January 2013 and June 2015, in six French acute care teaching hospitals. The clinical and microbiological efficacies of FOX and CP were compared using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for propensity scores. Of the 66 patients included, 23 patients in FOX group and 27 in CP group had clinical assessment at follow-up. Median follow-up after end of treatment was 63 days (interquartile range 26-114). Clinical success was observed for 17/23 (73.9%) and 22/27 (81.5%) patients and microbiological success for 11/19 (57.9%) and for 6/12 (50.0%) patients in FOX and CP groups respectively.

These population changes put increasing pressure on health and aged care services, thus it is important to assess the cost effectiveness of interventions targeted for older people across health and aged care sectors to identify interventions with the strongest capacity to enhance older peoples' quality of life and provide value for money. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a form of economic evaluation that typically uses preference-based instruments to measure and value health-related quality of life for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) to enable comparisons of the cost effectiveness of different interventions. A variety of generic preference-based instruments have been used to measure older people's quality of life, including the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT); Health Utility Index Mark 2 (HUI2); Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3); Short-Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D); Assessment of Quality of Life-6 dimensions (AQoL-6D); Assessment of Quality of Life-8 dimensions (AQoL-8D); Quality of Wellbeing Scale-Self-Administered (QWB-SA); 15 Dimensions (15D); EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D); and an older person specific preference-based instrument-the Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for older people (ICECAP-O). This article reviews the development and application of these instruments within the older population and discusses the issues surrounding their use with this population. Areas for further research relating to the development and application of generic preference-based instruments with populations of older people are also highlighted.</AbstractText>"}

This review considers the available data on the mechanisms underlying TH resistance with aging and compares these physiologic changes with the changes observed in congenital TH resistance syndromes. Aging is associated with alterations in TH economy along with a host of changes in the responsiveness of various tissues to THs. The age-related resistance to THs can be attributed to decreased TH transport to tissues, decreased nuclear receptor occupancy, decreased activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, and alterations in TH responsive gene expression. Although an increase in serum TH levels is expected in syndromes of TH resistance, unchanged serum TH levels in the euthyroid elderly is the result of increased sensitivity to TH negative feedback with increased suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone, decreased thyroidal sensitivity to thyroid-stimulating hormone, and decreased TH production and secretion. The current clinical evidence suggests that the age-related TH resistance is mostly an adaptive response of the aging organism. It is tempting to speculate that similar changes can occur prematurely in a group of younger people who present with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism despite normal serum thyroid function tests.</AbstractText>"}

(Elderberry) is widely used as a dietary supplement in functional food and possesses many pharmacological activities to prevent ailments, such as the colds and fever, diabetes and cancer. However, research on its skin anti-aging effect is still limited. Here, we evaluated the recovery effects of elderberry extract (EB) in UVB-irradiated human skin keratinocytes (HaCaTs) and investigated whether EB represents a potential therapeutic agent against skin photoaging and inflammation. In this study, EB showed good efficiency on scavenging free radicals and dose-dependently reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. EB notably decreased UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression and inflammatory cytokine secretion through the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases/activator protein 1 (MAPK/AP-1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways, blocking extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and inflammation in UVB-irradiated HaCaTs. In addition, EB improved nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling to increase oxidative defense capacity, and enhanced transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling activation to promote procollagen type I synthesis, relieving UVB-induced skin cell damage. These results indicated that EB has the potential to ameliorate UVB-induced skin photoaging and inflammation.</AbstractText>"}

However, a lack of lifespan studies has precluded verification of these theories. Here, we analyze the largest sample of carefully harmonized diffusion MRI data to comprehensively characterize age-related white matter trajectories, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA), across the course of schizophrenia. Our analysis comprises diffusion scans of 600 schizophrenia patients and 492 healthy controls at different illness stages and ages (14-65 years), which were gathered from 13 sites. We determined the pattern of age-related FA changes by cross-sectionally assessing the timing of the structural neuropathology associated with schizophrenia. Quadratic curves were used to model between-group FA differences across whole-brain white matter and fiber tracts at each age; fiber tracts were then clustered according to both the effect-sizes and pattern of lifespan white matter FA differences. In whole-brain white matter, FA was significantly lower across the lifespan (up to 7%; p &lt; 0.0033) and reached peak maturation younger in patients (27 years) compared to controls (33 years). Additionally, three distinct patterns of neuropathology emerged when investigating white matter fiber tracts in patients: (1) developmental abnormalities in limbic fibers, (2) accelerated aging and abnormal maturation in long-range association fibers, (3) severe developmental abnormalities and accelerated aging in callosal fibers. Our findings strongly suggest that white matter in schizophrenia is affected across entire stages of the disease. Perhaps most strikingly, we show that white matter changes in schizophrenia involve dynamic interactions between neuropathological processes in a tract-specific manner.</AbstractText>"}

Additionally, NAD serves as a substrate for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), sirtuin, and NAD glycohydrolase, and it regulates DNA repair, gene expression, energy metabolism, and stress responses. Many studies have demonstrated that NAD metabolism is deeply involved in aging and aging-related diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) and nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide (NHD), which are analogs of NAD, are significantly increased in Nmnat3-overexpressing mice. However, there is insufficient knowledge about NGD and NHD in vivo. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the metabolism and biochemical properties of these NAD analogs. We demonstrated that endogenous NGD and NHD were found in various murine tissues, and their synthesis and degradation partially rely on Nmnat3 and CD38. We have also shown that NGD and NHD serve as coenzymes for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in vitro, although their affinity is much lower than that of NAD. On the other hand, NGD and NHD cannot be used as substrates for SIRT1, SIRT3, and PARP1. These results reveal the basic metabolism of NGD and NHD and also highlight their biological function as coenzymes.</AbstractText>"}

Moreover, COX7RP overexpression associates with prognosis of breast cancer patients. We demonstrate that COX7RP overexpression in breast and endometrial cancer cells promotes in vitro and in vivo growth, stabilizes mitochondrial supercomplex assembly even in hypoxic states, and increases hypoxia tolerance. Metabolomic analyses reveal that COX7RP overexpression modulates the metabolic profile of cancer cells, particularly the steady-state levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Notably, silencing of each subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex decreases the COX7RP-stimulated cancer cell growth.

Notch signaling controls the choice between absorptive and entero-endocrine cell differentiation in both the mammalian small intestine and the Drosophila midgut, yet how Notch promotes lineage restriction remains unclear. Here, we describe a role for the transcription factor Klumpfuss (Klu) in restricting the fate of enteroblasts (EBs) in the Drosophila intestine. Klu is induced in Notch-positive EBs and its activity restricts cell fate towards the enterocyte (EC) lineage. Transcriptomics and DamID profiling show that Klu suppresses enteroendocrine (EE) fate by repressing the action of the proneural gene Scute, which is essential for EE differentiation. Loss of Klu results in differentiation of EBs into EE cells.

Although TKA has very good clinical results, revision knee arthroplasty can sometimes be necessary due to prosthetic components malalignment which leads to early polyethylene wear, instability and aseptic loosening. Currently, the revision risk of TKA at ten years is 5%. The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique which allows the modelling of complex geometry and system of loads. This method is a necessity in the field of orthopedics to simulate or predict the conditions that could lead to complications or failure and react to increase the longevity of TKA. The aim of this literature review is to highlight the relevance of using FEM along with TKA. Specialty literature research shows that the use of finite element analysis is widely spread in total knee arthroplasty. It is used to compare insert materials in order to obtain the most effective method and thus decrease the wear rate. Using simulated angles, forces and stress, FEM tests different malalignment conditions in order to apply these results in the pre-operative planning and avoid a possible TKA failure. The finite element analysis has a great potential of further refining TKA alignment outcome and is very important for the analysis of knee biomechanics under different loads. FEM is used to reduce the incidence of TKA revision and to improve patients satisfaction after TKA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Celsius.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Risk factors associated with the longitudinal progression of WMH in the general population have not been systematically investigated. To investigate the primary midlife and current cardiometabolic risk factors associated with changes in WMH over time in a population cohort. Methods- This cohort study included participants enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota with at least 2 consecutive WMH assessments on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-magnetic resonance images (n=554, ≥60 years with midlife assessments) with relevant baseline laboratory measures of interest. Linear mixed model regression was used to determine the important components of cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline that were associated with future progression of WMH. These analyses were controlled for age and sex. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using stratification by sex. The main outcome measure was percent change in WMH normalized to total intracranial volume. Three sets of models were constructed to evaluate individual (1) midlife risk factors, (2) current risk factors including the presence of metabolic syndrome and its constituents, and (3) baseline measurements of continuous laboratory measures of cardiometabolic risk. Results- Age was the strongest predictor of progression in WMH (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Baseline hypertension (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), midlife hypertension (<i>P</i>=0.003), and baseline fasting glucose in males (<i>P</i>=0.01) were predictive of WMH change. The presence of metabolic syndrome was not associated with progressive WMH. In sensitivity analyses, associations between hypertension and WMH progression were stronger in females. Baseline serum glucose was associated with increase in WMH but was not significant in females in the stratified analysis. Other continuous laboratory measures of vascular risk were not associated with progressive WMH. Conclusions- Midlife and current hypertension in all participants and fasting glucose in males were associated with quantitative changes in white matter. Prospective clinical studies should determine optimal blood pressure to reduce stroke and cognitive impairment during aging.</AbstractText>"}

In wild-type rodent models, chronic ingestion of LCSFA diets are associated with increased cerebral capillary permeability, heightened neurovascular inflammation and poorer cognitive performance. However, recent studies suggest that diets enriched in fat may paradoxically attenuate elements of the ageing phenotype via a caloric support axis. <b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of dietary LCSFA on cerebral capillary integrity and neurovascular inflammation in an established model of accelerated ageing, Senescence-Accelerated-Murine-Prone Strain 8 (SAMP8) mice. <b>Methods:</b> From 6 weeks of age, SAMP8 mice and age-matched controls were randomised to either normal chow, or to an LCSFA-enriched diet, for either 12 or 34 weeks.

Although the number of aging PLHIV is increasing, the effect of HIV infection on the process of aging is not fully understood. Understanding the complexity of aging with HIV by investigating the effect of the latter on different components of the innate and adaptive immune systems is important to reduce the impact of these comorbid conditions and improve the quality of life of PLHIV. The role of killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs), expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, and their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands in the clearance, susceptibility to or disease progression following HIV infection is well established. However, data on the effect of KIR-HLA interaction in aging HIV-infected population and the development of non-AIDS-related comorbid conditions are lacking.

Tasks of identifying the culprits of these deficits are of paramount importance but remains unaccomplished. We employ the full-range temperature (20 K -300 K) measurement on 275-nm DUV devices that subjected to a 15-hour current-stress aging. The results suggest that the primary culprit of fast luminous decay is the proliferation of non-radiative centers. The origins of two main parasitic peaks are identified. The 310-nm peak is considered to solely come from deep-level radiative centers (DLRCs) that only dwell in the active region. Whereas, the 400-nm peak is proven to be dual-sources. One is related to the DLRCs in the active region, which only can be observed at very low currents; the other emerging at higher currents are associated with similar kinds of DLRCs located in the p-region, which only are excited when electrons overflow. This new discovery also demonstrates that a thorough investigation on the interplay among carriers and various types of defects should be conducted on the basis of the measurement that is taken under a wide temperature range, as well as under a proper forward voltage. This is to let the quasi-Fermi level shift across deep defect levels, the band-edge, and to over-band, whereby these recombination sites are exposed to deficit, moderate and saturated electron environment so that their natures can be well tested.</AbstractText>"}

To investigate causal relationships and underlying mechanisms, we used an established NAFLD model-mice fed a high fat diet with supplemental fructose in the water ('fast food', FF). Iron did not affect excess hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mice on FF, and FF did not affect iron accumulation compared to normal chow. Mice on low iron are protected from worsening of markers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including serum transaminases and fibrotic gene transcript levels. These occurred prior to the onset of significant insulin resistance or changes in adipokines. Transcriptome sequencing revealed the major effects of iron to be on signaling by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, a known mechanistic factor in NASH. High iron increased fibrotic gene expression in vitro, demonstrating that the effect of dietary iron on NASH is direct.

On the other hand, no study has elucidated the correlation between household income and the HDL-C level in the adult population. In the present study, 5535 subjects (20-80 year-old individuals) were selected from the Korean national health and nutrition examination survey 2017 (KNHANES VII-2, <i>n</i> = 2469 men, <i>n</i> = 3066 women). They were classified into five levels of household income grades ranging from one (the lowest) to five (the highest). They were also classified according to the HDL-C level: category 1 (&lt;40 mg/dL, <i>n</i> = 943), category 2 (40-49 mg/dL, <i>n</i> = 1764), category 3 (50-59 mg/dL, <i>n</i> = 1572), category 4 (60-69 mg/dL, <i>n</i> = 820), and category 5 (≥70 mg/dL, <i>n</i> = 436). Generally, in both genders, a higher HDL-C level is associated with a larger percentage of income grades 4 and 5. Moreover, the lowest HDL-C group showed the largest percentage of income grade 1. In both groups, a significant increase in the average income grade was associated with a concomitant increase in the HDL-C level (men, <i>p</i> = 0.03, women, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In the low HDL-C category, a lower income grade is associated directly with a lower HDL-C level, which suggests that poverty is associated directly with a low HDL-C. Women showed a 3.3-fold higher incidence of dementia than men did at later-life. The sharp decrease in HDL-C in the female group older than 50 was accompanied by a dramatic increase in the incidence of dementia. However, the male group showed a relatively mild decrease in the HDL-C level after mid-life and weak elevation in the incidence of dementia. In conclusion, in both genders, the lower income group showed a larger prevalence of low-HDL-C levels. The decrease in HDL-C after middle age was strongly associated with the considerable increase in dementia in later-life.</AbstractText>"}

Many growth factors and peptides with cell-growth and collagen-synthesis activities have shown promise in their application in anti-aging materials. However, the effect of collagen production, without anti-inflammatory effect, and skin penetration may not be enough for their use in anti-aging agents. Previously, we reported a substance P (SP)-based hydrogel (SP gel) that had potential wound-healing activities via induction of skin cell regeneration and collagen synthesis. Here, we analyzed the anti-aging activities and skin absorption effects of SP gel to extend its characterization. Toxicity tests, performed on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and on a reconstructed 3D human skin model, indicated SP gel to be safe for long-term use, without causing irritation, even at high concentrations. In-vitro analysis revealed that SP gel elicited stronger collagen production activities than SP alone, and promoted anti-inflammatory effects with increased skin absorption properties. Moreover, SP gel did not induce melanin synthesis in a keratinocyte-melanocyte co-culture system. Together, the results suggest that SP gel has potential cosmetic effects and applicability as a novel ingredient in anti-aging products.</AbstractText>"}

Recently, there is a growing interest in the medical community in identifying novel, low-cost, safe molecules that may be used in the treatment of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that curcumin may represent an effective agent in the treatment of several skin conditions. We examined the most relevant in vitro and in vivo studies published to date regarding the use of curcumin in inflammatory, neoplastic, and infectious skin diseases, providing information on its bioavailability and safety profile. Moreover, we performed a computational analysis about curcumin's interaction towards the major enzymatic targets identified in the literature. Our results suggest that curcumin may represent a low-cost, well-tolerated, effective agent in the treatment of skin diseases. However, bypass of limitations of its in vivo use (low oral bioavailability, metabolism) is essential in order to conduct larger clinical trials that could confirm these observations. The possible use of curcumin in combination with traditional drugs and the formulations of novel delivery systems represent a very promising field for future applicative research.</AbstractText>"}

This paper addresses how older people cope when they give up driving, using Bourdieu's theory of capital as a way of categorising different barriers and enablers to managing without a car in a hypermobile society. Older people are most likely to mention barriers and enablers to mobility relating to infrastructure capital (technology, services, roads, pavements, finance and economics), followed by social capital (friends, family, neighbourhood and community). Cultural capital (norms, expectations, rules, laws) and individual capital (skills, abilities, resilience, adaptation and desire and willingness to change) are less important but still significantly contribute to older people's mobility.

The integrated strategy of combining the release of predatory mites and EPF may further promote biocontrol of pests. To examine the compatibility of A. limonicus and B. bassiana, we tested the lethal effects of B. bassiana on A. limonicus females on B. cockerelli and calculated the sublethal concentrations of B. bassiana. The effects of sublethal concentrations (LC<sub>10</sub> and LC<sub>30</sub>) of EPF on predatory mite females were assessed on the reproduction parameters of the parental generation (F<sub>0</sub>). We also evaluated the transgenerational effects of EPF on life table parameters and predation rates of the offspring generation (F<sub>1</sub>) that was fed on the psyllids. Our results showed that A. limonicus females were susceptible to B. bassiana and the LC<sub>50</sub> was 2.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> conidia mL<sup>-1</sup>. Sublethal concentrations of EPF (LC<sub>30</sub>) significantly reduced the fecundity, longevity, oviposition period and predation rates of F<sub>0</sub> predatory mite females. However, life table and predation rates of F<sub>1</sub> predatory mites were not influenced by sublethal concentrations (LC<sub>30</sub>), except for the reduction of the preadult and total pre-oviposition period, and the predation rate of F<sub>1</sub> males. Also, F<sub>1</sub> population parameters including the intrinsic rate of increase (r<sub>m</sub>), finite rate of increase (λ), gross reproduction rate (GRR), and net reproduction rate (R<sub>0</sub>) were not significantly influenced by sublethal concentrations (LC<sub>10</sub> and LC<sub>30</sub>). This result suggests that the transgenerational effects of entomopathogenic fungi cannot be carried over to F<sub>1</sub>. In conclusion, the simultaneous application of both biological control agents does have the potential to control TPP at appropriate intervals during the crop season. Further evaluation in the field will be needed to confirm the viability of this approach to control TPP.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here we report that C. elegans UNC-13L, a Munc13-1 ortholog, has three domains that inhibit synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis. These include the X (sequence between C2A and C1), C1, and C2B domains. Deleting all three inhibitory domains produces a hyperactive UNC-13 (sUNC-13) that exhibits dramatically increased neurotransmitter release, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of release, and release probability. The vesicular pool in unc-13 mutants rescued by sUNC-13 exhibits a faster synaptic recovery and replenishment rate, demonstrating an important role of sUNC-13 in regulating synaptic plasticity. Analysis of double mutants suggests that sUNC-13 enhances tonic release by increasing the open probability of UNC-64/syntaxin-1A, whereas its effects on evoked release appear to be mediated by additional functions, presumably by further regulating the activity of the assembled soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE) complex.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

During growth, Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) adjust fates by switching from asymmetric to symmetric lineages to scale the size of the ISC population. Using a combination of long-term live imaging, lineage tracing, and genetic perturbations, we demonstrate that this switch is executed through the control of mitotic spindle orientation by Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. JNK interacts with the WD40-repeat protein Wdr62 at the spindle and transcriptionally represses the kinesin Kif1a to promote planar spindle orientation. In stress conditions, this function becomes deleterious, resulting in overabundance of symmetric fates and contributing to the loss of tissue homeostasis in the aging animal. Restoring normal ISC spindle orientation by perturbing the JNK/Wdr62/Kif1a axis is sufficient to improve intestinal physiology and extend lifespan.

Innervation of adipose tissues by peripheral nerves provides a means of communication between the master metabolic regulator in the brain (chiefly the hypothalamus), and energy-expending and energy-storing cells in the body (primarily adipocytes). Although chemical and surgical denervation studies have clearly demonstrated how crucial adipose tissue neural innervation is for maintaining proper metabolic health, we have uncovered that adipose tissue becomes neuropathic (ie: reduction in neurites) in various conditions of metabolic dysregulation. Here, utilizing both human and mouse adipose tissues, we present evidence of adipose tissue neuropathy, or loss of proper innervation, under pathophysiological conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and aging, all of which are concomitant with insult to the adipose organ as well as metabolic dysfunction. Neuropathy is indicated by loss of nerve fiber protein expression, reduction in synaptic markers, and lower neurotrophic factor expression in adipose tissue. Aging-related adipose neuropathy particularly results in loss of innervation around the tissue vasculature, which cannot be reversed by exercise. Together with indications of neuropathy in muscle and bone, these findings underscore that peripheral neuropathy is not restricted to classic tissues like the skin of distal extremities, and that loss of innervation to adipose may trigger or exacerbate metabolic diseases. In addition, we have demonstrated stimulation of adipose tissue neural plasticity with cold exposure, which may ameliorate adipose neuropathy and be a potential therapeutic option to re-innervate adipose and restore metabolic health.</AbstractText>"}

Despite numerous studies worldwide, our understanding of the pattern and stability of fox social relationships remains limited. We applied social network analysis to camera trap data collected at high-quality foraging patches to examine the social structure of a population of urban red foxes. Foxes encountered a conspecific on 13% of patch visits, and had significant preferred and avoided companionships in all seasons. They also associated in communities that matched territorial space use, confirming that territories can be analysed separately to increase power without excluding too many social partners. Foxes maintained stable, long-term relationships with other territory residents, but the average longevity of relationships varied seasonally, suggesting that social connectivity, particularly between foxes from different social groups, is influenced by their annual life cycle. The probability of re-association after a given time lag was highest in spring and summer, during cub birth and rearing, and lowest in the winter mating season, when mean relationship duration was shorter. 33% of fox relationships lasted for four consecutive seasons and were probably between territory residents. 14% lasted for around 20 days and were probably between residents and visitors from adjacent territories. The majority (53%) lasted less than one day, particularly during dispersal and mating, and were probably between foxes from non-adjacent social groups. Social structure varied between groups; in one group the death of the dominant male caused significant social disruption for two seasons. This is the first application of social network analysis to multiple red fox social groups. However, our analyses were based on interactions at high quality food patches; social connections may differ when foxes are resting, travelling and foraging elsewhere in their territory.

The results demonstrated that TLR2 deficit induced learning disabilities, decreased spontaneous activity, increased anxiety and depression, and led to white matter damage (WMD), brain atrophy, loss of neurons, and glial activation. Moreover, TLR2 deficit aggravated impaired neurobehavioral functions and WMD in AD mice, but did not affect the Aβ deposition in mouse brains. Our data indicate that the genomic deletion of TLR2 impairs neurobehavioral functions, induces WMD and brain atrophy, and increases the activation of astrocytes, which in turn aggravate the symptoms of AD through a non-Aβ mechanism.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this study is to determine age-related behavioral changes of F2 hybrid C57BL/6NxBALB/c male and female mice. Lifespan was followed (n<sub>males</sub>=48, n<sub>females</sub>=51) and cohorts of mature adult (7 months), middle-aged (15 months), and old mice (22 months of age; n=7-12 per group) were assessed regarding open-field activity, exploration, passive avoidance learning/memory, and depressive-like behavior. We found that both males and females demonstrated decreased exploratory behavior with age, while memory and depressive-like behavior were maintained. Females exhibited enhanced depressive-like behavior compared to males; however, a correlation between fat mass and swimming activity in the test directly accounted for 30-46% of this behavioral sex difference. In addition, we suggest a method to qualitatively estimate natural lifespan from survival analyses in which animals with signs of pain or severe disease are euthanized. This is, to our knowledge, the first behavioral study to consider both sex and aging in hybrid mice. We here define decreased exploratory behavior as a conserved hallmark of aging independent of sex, highlight the effect of buoyancy in water tests, and provide a method to assay lifespan with reduced animal suffering.</AbstractText>"}

We asked whether age affects gait balance recovery adaptation, its retention over months, and the transfer of adaptation to an untrained reactive balance task. Healthy adults (26 young, 27 middle-aged, and 25 older; average ages 24, 52, and 72 yr, respectively) completed two tasks. The primary task involved treadmill walking: either unperturbed (control; <i>n</i> = 39) or subject to unexpected trip perturbations (training; <i>n</i> = 39). A single trip perturbation was repeated after a 14-wk retention period. The secondary transfer task, before and after treadmill walking, involved sudden loss of balance in a lean-and-release protocol. For both tasks, the anteroposterior margin of stability (MoS) was calculated at foot touchdown. For the first (i.e., novel) trip, older adults required one more recovery step (<i>P</i> = 0.03) to regain positive MoS compared with younger, but not middle-aged, adults. However, over several trip perturbations, all age groups increased their MoS for the first recovery step to a similar extent (up to 70%) and retained improvements over 14 wk, although a decay over time was found for older adults (<i>P</i> = 0.002; middle-aged showing a tendency for decay: <i>P</i> = 0.076). Thus, although adaptability in reactive gait stability control remains effective across the adult life span, retention of adaptations over time appears diminished with aging. Despite these robust adaptations, the perturbation training group did not show superior improvements in the transfer task compared with age-matched controls (no differences in MoS changes), suggesting that generalizability of acquired fall-resisting skills from gait-perturbation training may be limited.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> The human neuromotor system preserves its adaptability across the adult life span. However, although adaptability in reactive gait stability control remains effective as age increases, retention of recovery response adaptations over time appears to be reduced with aging. Furthermore, acquired fall-resisting skills from single-session perturbation training seem task specific, which may limit the generalizability of such training to the variety of real-life falls.</AbstractText>"}

Herein, we present muscle architecture data for the forearm musculature (flexors and extensors of the wrist and digits) of Microcebus murinus, a small Lemuroid that has been the focus of several developmental studies. A quadratic curvilinear model described ontogenetic changes in muscle mass and fascicle length; however, fascicle lengths reached peak levels at an earlier age and showed a stronger decline during senescence. Conversely, physiological cross-sectional area followed a more linear trend, increasing steadily throughout life. As previous studies into the functional role of the primate forelimb emphasize the importance of long muscle fascicles within arboreal taxa in order to maximize mobility and flexibility, the early attainment of peak fascicle lengths may consequently reflect the importance of agility within this mobile and highly arboreal species. Similarly, observed myological trends in forearm strength are supported by previous in vivo data on grip strength within M. murinus in which senescent individuals showed no decline in forearm force relative to prime age individuals. This trend is interpreted to reflect compensation for the previously reported decline in hind limb grip strength in the hind limb with age, such that older individuals are able to maintain arboreal stability. Interestingly, the ontogenetic trajectory of each architectural variable mirrored previous observations of the masticatory musculature in M. murinus, suggesting that ontogenetic trends are relatively conserved between anatomical regions.

Here we report that PDZ and LIM domain protein 1 (PDLIM1) is significantly downregulated in metastatic human HCC tissues, which predicts unfavorable prognosis, suggesting that PDLIM1 may play an important inhibitory role during HCC metastasis. Functional studies indicate that PDLIM1 knockdown induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells, elevates their invasive capacity and promotes metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of PDLIM1 exhibits opposite phenotypes. Mechanistically, PDLIM1 competitively binds to the cytoskeleton cross-linking protein ACTN4, leading to the disassociation of ACTN4 from F-actin, thus preventing F-actin overgrowth. In contrast, loss of PDLIM1 induces excessive F-actin formation, resulting in dephosphorylation of LATS1 and activation of YAP, thereby promoting HCC metastasis. Moreover, Asn145 (N145) of PDLIM1 is critical for its interaction with ACTN4, and N145A mutation abolishes its regulatory function in Hippo signaling and HCC metastasis. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that PDLIM1 suppresses HCC metastasis via modulating Hippo signaling, suggesting that PDLIM1 may be a potential prognostic marker for metastatic HCC.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Current work indicates that FUS mutations may incur gain-of-toxic functions to drive ALS pathogenesis. However, how FUS dysfunction may affect cognition remains elusive. Using a mouse model expressing wild-type human FUS mimicking the endogenous expression pattern and level within the central nervous system, we found that they developed hippocampus-mediated cognitive deficits accompanied by an age-dependent reduction in spine density and long-term potentiation in their hippocampus. However, there were no apparent FUS aggregates, nuclear envelope defects and cytosolic FUS accumulation. These suggest that these proposed pathogenic mechanisms may not be the underlying causes for the observed cognitive deficits. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis identified expression changes in a small set of genes with preferential expression in the neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Of these, we focused on Sema5a, a gene involved in axon guidance, spine dynamics, Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorders. Critically, FUS binds directly to Sema5a mRNA and regulates Sema5a expression in a FUS-dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that FUS-driven Sema5a deregulation may underlie the cognitive deficits in FUS transgenic mice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

In respect of CpG regions, CpG islands in promoters and some intragenic regions showed greater levels of methylation in the sarcopenic group. dmCpG-related KEGG pathways were mainly associated with muscle function, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and energy metabolism. Seven genes (HSPB1, PBX4, CNKSR3, ORMDL3, MIR10A, ZNF619, and CRADD) were found with the same methylation direction as previous studies of blood sample methylation during ageing.

Protein aggregation is an abnormal interaction between proteins caused as a result of structural changes in them after any mutation or environmental assault. Protein aggregation is usually associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, but of late, research findings have shown its association with the development of different cancers like lung, breast and ovarian cancer. On the contrary, protein glycation is a cascade of irreversible nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugar with the amino group of the protein resulting in the modification of protein structure and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These AGEs are reported to obstruct the normal function of proteins. Lately, it has been reported that protein aggregation occurs as a result of AGEs. This aggregation of protein promotes the transformation of healthy cells to neoplasia leading to tumorigenesis. In this review, we underline the current knowledge of protein aggregation and glycation along with the cross talk between the two, which may eventually lead to the development of cancer.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2020.

OFBB forms spherical particles with Zn(II). Compared with OFBB, OFBT has an additional thiazole moiety, which forms spherical particles with Zn(II) and then transforms to a crystalline nanobelt in 2 h. The process and mechanism of the nanosphere and nanobelt formation were investigated in detail. The double S···N interaction between two benzothiazoles in adjacent oligomers played a significant contribution in this dynamic morphology transformation.

An important hallmark of metabolic disorders is chronic low-grade inflammation. A key player in chronic low-grade inflammation is dysmetabolism, which is defined as the inability to keep homeostasis resulting in loss of lipid control, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Although often not yet detectable in the circulation, chronic low-grade inflammation can be present in one or multiple organs. The response to a metabolic challenge containing lipids may magnify dysfunctionalities at the tissue level, causing an overflow of inflammatory markers into the circulation and hence allow detection of early low-grade inflammation. Here, we summarize the evidence of successful application of metabolic challenge tests in type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and unhealthy aging. We also review how metabolic challenge tests have been successfully applied to evaluate nutritional intervention effects, including an 'anti-inflammatory' mixture, dark chocolate, whole grain wheat and overfeeding. Additionally, we elaborate on future strategies to (re)gain inflammatory flexibility. Through epigenetic and metabolic regulation, the inflammatory response may be trained by regular mild and metabolic triggers, which can be understood from the perspective of trained immunity, hormesis and pro-resolution. New strategies to optimize dynamics of inflammation may become available.</AbstractText>"}

PERP is upregulated following sustained starvation-induced autophagy, which precedes the onset of apoptosis indicating that PERP protein levels are controlled by a lysosomal pathway that is sensitive to cellular physiological state. Furthermore, ER stress stabilizes PERP at the PM and induces its increasing co-localization with SERCA2b at ER-PM junctions.

Median age was 7.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4.3-11.1). Median longevity was 13.4 years (IQR 11.0-15.0). Males (13.8 years) outlived females (12.9 years) (<i>P</i> = 0.045). The most common grouped causes of death were lower respiratory tract (10.2, 95% CI: 5.5-16.7), neoplastic (10.2, 95% CI: 5.5-16.7) and spinal cord disorder (7.8, 95% CI: 3.8-13.9). Overall, 71.5% WHWTs had &gt; 1 disorder recorded during 2016. The most prevalent specific disorders were periodontal disease (15.7, 95% CI: 14.1-17.3), otitis externa (10.6, 95% CI: 9.3-12.0), overgrown nails (7.2, 95% CI: 6.2-8.4), allergic skin disorder (6.5, 95% CI: 5.5-7.7) and obesity (6.1, 95% CI: 5.1-7.2).

Whereas common SKs are more frequent in Caucasians, dermatosis papulosa nigra is more prevalent in patients with a Fitzpatrick skin type of at least 3. There seems to be a link between extrinsic skin aging and the occurrence of SK. Mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 and other signaling molecules are a frequent finding in SK lesions. However, this does not translate into any malignant potential. Viral infections are particularly common in genital lesions, although their pathogenetic relevance for SK is questionable. Different histologic and clinical subtypes have been identified. The great variability of SKs raises some difficulties in diagnosis. Dermoscopy is the preferred non-invasive diagnostic method, in particular to differentiate pigmented SKs from other pigment tumors, including cutaneous melanoma. Eruptive SKs can be a paraneoplastic condition known as the Leser-Trélat sign. New targeted cancer treatments can cause a pseudo-Leser-Trélat sign. The treatment in practice is mainly minor surgery, including cryosurgery, shave excisions, and laser-assisted removal. The medical approaches have only limited effects. Recently, two formulations for topical therapy have been evaluated: a product with 40% hydrogen peroxide (HP40) and an aqueous nitric-zinc complex. Based on clinical trials, HP40 seems to be a promising alternative to surgery, in particular for facial lesions.</AbstractText>"}

The extracellular domain of the M2-ion channel (M2e) is an ideal antigenic target, as it is highly conserved, has a low mutation rate, and is essential for viral entry and replication. Considering the potential of a universal influenza vaccine for lifelong protection, we aimed to examine this potential using a recently published gold nanoparticle M2e vaccine with CpG as an adjuvant (AuNP-M2e + sCpG). Intranasal vaccination induces an M2e-specific memory response, which is protective against lethal infection with H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 serotypes, in young BALB/c mice. Protection with AuNP-M2e + sCpG has been published up to 8 months after vaccination. However, the highest risk population during most influenza seasons is adults over 65 years old.

Based on the evidence from high-income countries (HIC), the risk of an enhanced, and accentuated onset of premature-aging or age-related diseases has been observed in PLHIV. However, very limited data is available on residual inflammation and immune activation in the populations who are on first-generation anti-HIV drugs like zidovudine and lamivudine that have more toxic side effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of systemic inflammation and understand the risk of age-associated diseases in PLHIV on long-term suppressive ART using a large number of biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation. Blood samples were obtained from therapy naïve PLHIV (Pre-ART, <i>n</i> = 43), PLHIV on ART for &gt;5 years (ART, <i>n</i> = 53), and HIV-negative healthy controls (HIVNC, <i>n</i> = 41). Samples were analyzed for 92 markers of inflammation, sCD14, sCD163, and telomere length. Several statistical tests were performed to compare the groups under study. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the associations. Despite a median duration of 8 years of successful ART, sCD14 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and sCD163 (<i>p</i> = 0.04) levels continued to be significantly elevated in ART group as compared to HIVNC. Eleven inflammatory markers, including 4E-BP1, ADA, CCL23, CD5, CD8A, CST5, MMP1, NT3, SLAMF1, TRAIL, and TRANCE, were found to be significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) between the groups. Many of these markers are associated with age-related co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive decline and some of these markers are being reported for the first time in the context of HIV-induced inflammation. Linear regression analysis showed a significant negative association between HIV-1-positivity and telomere length (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).

The first known ingestion of foods often causes allergic reaction, suggesting that sensitization of offspring with food allergens may occur during pregnancy and/or through breastfeeding. This creates a milieu that shapes the neonatal immune responses to these allergens. However, the effects of maternal allergen exposure and maternal sensitization with allergens on development of allergies in offspring remain controversial. This review discusses recent advances from human data in our understanding of how maternal factors, namely, food allergens, allergen-specific immunoglobulins, cytokines, genetics, and environmental factors transferred during pregnancy or breastfeeding influence offspring allergies and how such effects may be applicable to food allergy. Based on information obtained from mouse models of asthma and food allergy, the review also dissects the mechanisms by which maternal factors, including the impact of immune complexes, transforming growth factor-β, vitamin A, and regulatory T-cell responses, contribute to the induction of neonatal tolerance vs. development of allergic responses to maternally transferred allergens.</AbstractText>"}

MR is expressed in several extra-renal tissues, including the heart, vasculature, and adipose tissue. More recent studies have shown that extra-renal MR plays a relevant role in the control of cardiovascular and metabolic functions and has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of aging. MR activation promotes vasoconstriction and acts as a potent pro-fibrotic agent in cardiovascular remodeling. Aging is associated with increased arterial stiffness and vascular tone, and modifications of arterial structure and function are responsible for these alterations. MR activation contributes to increase blood pressure with aging by regulating myogenic tone, vasoconstriction, and vascular oxidative stress. Importantly, aging represents an important contributor to the increased prevalence of cardiometabolic syndrome. In the elderly, dysregulation of MR signaling is associated with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, representing an important cause of increased cardiovascular risk. Clinical use of MR antagonists is limited by the adverse effects induced by MR blockade in the kidney, raising the risk of hyperkalaemia in older patients with reduced renal function. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the enhanced understanding of the role of MR in aging and for development of novel specific MR antagonists in the context of cardiovascular rehabilitation in the elderly, in order to reduce relevant side effects.</AbstractText>"}

Repetitive peripheral magnetic nerve stimulation (rPMS) is a putative adjuvant therapy that improves the mobility of patients, but the underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-eight participants underwent either an rPMS treatment (<i>N</i> = 19) with a 5 Hz stimulation protocol in the posterior tibial nerve or sham stimulation (<i>N</i> = 19). The stimulation took place over 5 min. The study was conducted in a pre-test post-test design with matched groups.

No significant effects showed in the sham stimulation group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Low-frequency magnetic stimulation (5 Hz rPMS) shows a substantial reduction of the tendon reflex amplitude. It seems to be an effective procedure to reduce muscular stiffness, increase mobility, and thus, makes the therapeutic effect of neuro-rehabilitation more effective. For this reason, the 5 Hz rPMS treatment might have the potential to be used as an adjuvant therapy in the rehabilitation of gait and posture control in patients suffering from limited mobility due to spasticity. The effect observed in this study should be investigated conjoined with the presented method in patients with impaired mobility due to spasticity.</AbstractText>"}

While numerous factors confer resilience, research has largely examined these measures in isolation, despite evidence of their synergistic effects. Conceptualizing resilience from a multisystem perspective may provide a deeper understanding of adaptive functioning in pain. Sixty adults (ages 60+ years) with chronic low back pain completed measures of physical function, pain intensity, disability, and a performance-based task assessing back-related physical functioning and movement-evoked pain (MEP). Depressive symptoms, quality of life, and general resilience were also evaluated. To examine multisystem resiliency, principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to create composite domains for psychological (positive affect, hope, positive well-being, optimism), health (waist-hip ratio, body mass index, medical comorbidities), and social (emotional, instrumental, informational support) functioning measures, followed by cluster analysis to identify participant subgroups based upon composites. Results yielded four clusters: Cluster 1 (high levels of functioning across psychological, health, and social support domains); Cluster 2 (optimal health and low psychosocial functioning); Cluster 3 (high psychological function, moderate-to-high social support, and poorer health); and Cluster 4 (low levels of functioning across the three domains). Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, individuals with a more resilient phenotype (Cluster 1) exhibited lower levels of disability, higher quality of life and psychological functioning, and greater functional performance when compared to those with a lower degree of personal resources (Cluster 4). No significant cluster differences emerged in self-reported pain intensity or MEP. These findings signify the presence of resiliency profiles based upon psychological, social, and health-related functioning. Further examination of the additive effects of multiple adaptive behaviors and resources may improve our understanding of resilience in the context of pain, informing novel interventions for older adults.</AbstractText>"}

A total of 150 master endurance runners [age 68 (5) years; 111 male, 39 female] were divided into early starters (training all of their adulthood) and late starters (started training after age 50 years). A comparative non-athletic group of 59 healthy older adults [age 73 (4) years; 30 female, 29 male] were additionally included for analysis. Training intensity, age-graded performance (AGP) and musculoskeletal assessments were performed. Results showed that there was no difference between athlete groups for training intensity or age-graded performance, despite the 30-year difference in training history. Body fat percentage and leg lean mass did not differ between athlete groups, but were 17% lower and 12% greater, respectively, in athlete groups compared with controls. Power normalized to body mass did not differ between any groups. Spine BMD was lower in late starters than controls, while early starters did not differ from late starters or controls. Hip BMD did not differ between any of the groups. These findings show that the Masters athletes we studied that started intense endurance running after the age of 50 years had lower body fat and higher leg lean mass compared to non-athletes.

At the moment, no effective treatments are available in the market, making the whole situation a compelling challenge for societies worldwide. Recently, novel mechanisms have been proposed to explain the etiology of this disease leading to the new concept that AD is a multifactor pathology. Among others, the function of mitochondria has been considered as one of the intracellular processes severely compromised in AD since the early stages and likely represents a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Many mitochondrial parameters decline already during the aging, reaching an extensive functional failure concomitant with the onset of neurodegenerative conditions, although the exact timeline of these events is still unclear. Thereby, it is not surprising that mitochondria have been already considered as therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Together with an overview of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, this review examines the pros and cons of the tested therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondria in the context of AD. Since mitochondrial therapies in AD have shown different degrees of progress, it is imperative to perform a detailed analysis of the significance of mitochondrial deterioration in AD and of a pharmacological treatment at this level. This step would be very important for the field, as an effective drug treatment in AD is still missing and new therapeutic concepts are urgently needed.</AbstractText>"}

Three discourse tasks (an episodic narrative, a planning task, and a picture description) were performed by 30 aMCI, 22 naMCI, and 21 HC participants. Samples were analyzed using six categories of 15 measures, namely coherence, cohesion, proposition, grammaticality, lexicality, and fluency. The statistical analyses included (1) a multivariate analysis of variance for group comparison; (2) binary simple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for differentiation between two groups; (3) binary multiple logistic regression for being diagnosed with naMCI or aMCI with the minimum number of predictors; and (4) Pearson correlation analysis for identifying the cognitive functions associated with the discourse measures. The proportion of cohesive words and propositional density in aMCI participants were worse than those in naMCI participants. Global coherence, the proportion of cohesive words, and the proportion of dysfluencies and pauses in naMCI participants were lower than those in the HC participants. Global and local coherence and the proportion of cohesive words, cohesive ties per utterances, propositional density, and dysfluencies and pauses in aMCI participants were worse than those in the HC participants. The aforementioned measures were demonstrated to be effective predictors for classifying groups by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In addition, the proportions of cohesive words and pauses were common discourse measures for differentiation between naMCI and HC participants or between aMCI and HC participants using binary multiple logistic regression. According to the correlation analysis, memory and executive functions are needed for coherent, cohesive, and efficient discourse productions in MCI.

From here, only compounds that met the <i>in silico</i> selection criteria were selected for the second section through <i>in vitro</i> investigations, including AChE enzyme inhibition assay, 3-(4,5-dimenthylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Thioflavin T (ThT) assay, and biochemical analysis <i>via</i> a neuronal cell line model. Of the four compounds screened, only curcumin (-9.6 kcal/mol) and piperine (-10.5 kcal/mol) showed favorable binding affinities and interactions towards AChE and were hence selected. <i>In vitro</i> AChE inhibition demonstrated that combination of curcumin and piperine showed greater AChE inhibition with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 62.81 ± 0.01 μg/ml as compared to individual compounds, i.e., IC<sub>50</sub> of curcumin at 134.5 ± 0.06 μg/ml and IC<sub>50</sub> of piperine at 76.6 ± 0.08 μg/ml. In the SH-SY5Y cell model, this combination preserved cell viability up to 85%, indicating that the compounds protect against Aβ-induced neuronal damage (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, our results also showed that curcumin and piperine achieved a synergistic effect at 35 μM with an synergism quotient (SQ) value of 1.824. Synergistic behavior indicates that the combination of these two compounds at lower concentrations may provide a better outcome than singularly used for Aβ proteins. Combined curcumin and piperine managed to inhibit aggregation (reduced ThT intensity at 0.432 a.u.; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) as well as disaggregation (reduced ThT intensity at 0.532 a.u.; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) of fibrillar Aβ42. Furthermore, combined curcumin and piperine reversed the Aβ-induced up-regulation of neuronal oxidative stress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, curcumin and piperine demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects, whereas bacoside A and chebulinic acid may not be suitable lead compounds. These results are hoped to advance the field of natural products research as potentially therapeutic and curative AD agents.</AbstractText>"}

In terminally differentiated cells, however, the mechanisms of DNA damage repair are less well known. In this study, we investigate whether RAD6B is involved in DSBs repair in neurons and effects of RAD6B deficiency on neuronal survival. We compared neurons of RAD6B-deficient mice with those of littermate wild type (WT) mice and induced DNA damage by X-ray irradiation. We provide evidence that RAD6B is essential for neural DDR and RAD6B deficiency results in increased genomic instability and neurodegeneration. Moreover, higher levels of p53 and p21 are present in the brains of RAD6B-deficient mice, which may be responsible for neuronal senescence, and degeneration. In addition, behavioral experiments show that RAD6B-deficient mice exhibit marked learning and memory deficits. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RAD6B is critical for neural integrity and that the absence of RAD6B accelerates neurodegeneration in mice.</AbstractText>"}

Amongst them, retinal implants have been designed to restore visual perception in blind patients affected by photoreceptor degeneration diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinitis pigmentosa (RP). While designing such a neural interface, several aspects must be taken into account, like the stimulation efficiency related to the current distribution within the tissue, the bio-interface optimization to improve resolution and tissue integration, and the material biocompatibility associated with long-term aging. In this study, we investigate the use of original microelectrode geometries for subretinal stimulation. The proposed structures combine the use of 3D wells with protuberant mushroom shaped electrode structures in the bottom, implemented on a flexible substrate that allows the <i>in vivo</i> implantation of the devices. These 3D microelectrode structures were first modeled using finite element analysis.

Cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to cognitive reserve is crucial, so effective strategies for the prevention of dementia can be developed. Engaging in physical activity can delay cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia and a number of early life conditions have been shown to have long-lasting effects on cognition. This mini-review combines these two observations to evaluate the evidence from both animal models and epidemiological studies for physical activity in early life (≤30 years) delaying cognitive decline in later life (cognition tested ≥60 years). Three epidemiological studies were found; two showed a positive association and one found none. The latter was deemed to have an unreliable method. A review of animal studies found none that analyzed the effect of physical activity in early life on cognition in later life. However, in rodent models that analyzed mid-life cognition, runners showed improved cognition and enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, changes which were preserved across the life span. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether physical activity in early life may delay cognitive decline in later life, but these results indicate that further studies are warranted. Future human research should be in the form of longitudinal studies that begin below ≤15 years and assess sex differences. Crucially, the physical activity data must define type, quantity and intensity of exercise.</AbstractText>"}

ILF abnormalities have been associated with deficits in visual processing and language comprehension in dementia patients, thus suggesting that its integrity is important for semantic processing. However, it remains elusive whether ILF microstructural organization <i>per se</i> impacts the visual semantic processing efficiency in the healthy brain. The present study aims to investigate whether there is an association between ILF's microstructural organization and visual semantic processing at the individual level. We hypothesized that the efficiency of visual semantic processing positively correlates with the degree of anisotropy of the ILF. We studied 10 healthy right-handed subjects. We determined fractional anisotropy (FA) of the ILF using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We extracted N400m latency and amplitude from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during a visual semantic decision task. N400m and mean FA of the ILF were left lateralized with the higher FA value in the left hemisphere. Inter-individual analysis showed that FA of the ILF negatively correlated with the N400m latency and amplitude, which suggests that high ILF anisotropy is associated with more efficient semantic processing. In summary, our findings provide supporting evidence for a role of the ILF in language comprehension.</AbstractText>"}

By this view, we rely on people and things around us to 'scaffold' mental processes such as memory. In the current study, we identified 39 long-married, older adult couples who are part of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing; all were cognitively healthy but half were subjective memory complainers. During two visits to their homes 1 week apart, we assessed husbands' and wives' cognitive performance across a range of everyday memory tasks working alone (Week 1) versus together (Week 2), including a Friends Task where they provided first and last names of their friends and acquaintances. As reported elsewhere, elderly couples recalled many more friends' names working together compared to alone. Couples who remembered successfully together used well-developed, rich, sensitive, and dynamic communication strategies to boost each other's recall. However, if one or both spouses self-reported mild-to-moderate or severe hearing difficulties (56% of husbands, 31% of wives), couples received less benefit from collaboration. Our findings imply that hearing loss may disrupt collaborative support structures that couples (and other intimate communicative partners) hone over decades together. We discuss the possibility that, cut off from the social world that scaffolds them, hearing loss may place older adults at greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia.</AbstractText>"}

Failure of protein maintenance is a major contributor to the age-associated accumulation of damaged proteins that is believed to participate to the age-related decline in cellular function. In this context, quantitative proteomics approaches, including 2-D gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based methods, represent powerful tools for monitoring the extent of protein oxidative modifications at the proteome level and for identifying the targeted proteins, also referred as to the 'oxi-proteome.' Previous studies have identified proteins targeted by oxidative modifications during replicative senescence of human WI-38 fibroblasts and myoblasts and have been shown to represent a restricted set within the total cellular proteome that fall in key functional categories, such as energy metabolism, protein quality control, and cellular morphology. To provide mechanistic support into the role of oxidized proteins in the development of the senescent phenotype, untargeted metabolomic profiling is also performed for young and senescent myoblasts and fibroblasts. Metabolomic profiling is indicative of energy metabolism impairment in both senescent myoblasts and fibroblasts, suggesting a link between oxidative protein modifications and the altered cellular metabolism associated with the senescent phenotype of human myoblasts and fibroblasts.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

There is a need to quantify the altered metabolism patterns that exist on a continuum into a simple measure. This work proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with residual connections that generates a probability score useful for interpreting the FDG-PET images along the continuum of AD.

Population ageing, ageing-in-place policies, pressures to contain costs and organisational reforms linked to New Public Management are challenging public home care. There is, however, limited knowledge about how the job content and working conditions have changed in the Swedish home care across this period. This article aims to analyse and compare the work situation in the Swedish home care in 2005 and 2015. The analysis is based on the international Nordcare survey and draws on the subsample of respondents working in Swedish home care 2005 and 2015 (n = 371). The data were analysed with bivariate and multivariate methods. The results suggest that, overall, the work situation of home-care workers was worse in 2015 compared to 2005. For example, those surveyed in 2015 reported meeting a larger number of clients per day, receiving less support from their supervisors, and having less time to discuss difficult situations with colleagues and considerably less scope to affect the planning of their daily work. Care workers in 2015 were also more mentally exhausted than those surveyed in 2005. In addition, the workers in 2015 experienced an accumulation of work-related problems. Deteriorating working conditions could be related to cutbacks and organisational reforms, and evidence suggests that home-care workers are paying a high price for ageing-in-place policies. Improvements of the work situation in home care are necessary not only to ensure the quality of care for older people, but also to ensure workers' well-being and to recruit and retain care workers, and thus, to meet the future needs for home care in an ageing society.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The objective of the present study was to provide a background to environmental challenges in the home, related to demographic ageing. Specific aims were to compare: 1) demography and household composition 2) physical housing stocks 3) indoor accidents and 4) housing adaptations between the two countries. Descriptive analyses were conducted using secondary data sources. Demographic ageing is projected to accelerate faster in Japan compared to Sweden, with overall lower fertility rates expected in Japan. In 2050, 39% of the Japanese population is projected to be aged 65 years or older, compared to 23% of the Swedish population. The Swedish ordinary housing stock was markedly older than the Japanese housing stock, with almost 80% of the dwellings built before 1980, while in Japan about 65% were built after 1980. High occurrences of fatal indoor accidents were noted in both countries, but for different reasons. In Sweden, falls was the dominant cause of fatal accidents among older people, while in Japan, in addition to falls, drowning and suffocation caused most of the fatal accidents. Housing adaptations were less frequent in Japan compared to Sweden, and the procedure for evaluating, granting and carrying out housing adaptations appeared to be more complicated in Japan. To decrease the occurrence of indoor accidents, identifying and removing 'risk barriers' could be instrumental. In both countries, large-scale efforts are imperative to improve the housing situation for the ageing population.</AbstractText>"}

We investigated associations between two functional measures of sarcopenia, grip strength and gait speed (GS), with functional disability in adults from six LMICs. Data were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2007-2010) for adults (≥ 65 years) from China, Mexico, Ghana, India, Russia and South Africa (n = 10,892, 52.8% women). We calculated country-specific prevalence of low grip strength, slow GS (≤ 0.8 m/s), and both measures combined. Using multivariable negative binomial regression, we separately assessed associations between low grip strength, slow GS, and both measures combined, with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, accounting for selected socioeconomic factors. In women, low grip strength ranged from 7 in South Africa to 51% in India; in men, it ranged from 17 in Russia to 51% in Mexico. Country-specific proportions of slow GS ranged from 77 in Russia, to 33% in China. The concomitant presence of both was the lowest in South Africa and the highest in India (12.3% vs. 33%). Independent of age, those with both low grip strength and slow GS had between 1.2- and 1.5-fold worse functional disability scores, independent of comorbidities, low education, and low wealth (all country-dependent). Low grip strength, slow GS, and the combination of both, were all associated with higher levels of functional disability, thus indicating these objective measures offer a reasonably robust estimate for potential poor health outcomes.</AbstractText>"}

A qualitative study was conducted via focus groups involving post-menopausal women with or without osteoporotic fractures, osteoporotic men and people with GIOP. Fifty-three participants were included in eight groups. A wide range of health beliefs was found for all types of OP. Osteoporosis was considered a natural consequence of ageing except in men or conversely a serious disease associated with risk of new fractures and disability. GIOP patients had heterogeneous knowledge of OP and reported fewer prevention behaviours, and their quality of life was affected by the causal illness. Men had difficulties coping with the loss of their functional abilities and felt that OP was a 'women's' disease. Beliefs about treatments ranged from confidence to fear of adverse effects or doubt about efficacy in all types of OP. Participants were interested in physical activity, fall prevention and diet, and preferred group sessions. GIOP patients and men had an interest in face-to-face education. Men were also interested in brief information including via the Internet. Patients' beliefs about OP differed by type of OP. Specific populations such as men or people with GIOP need particular care owing to experiences and needs. Offering group sessions in educational interventions is of interest to allow for sharing experiences and also face-to-face education for men and GIOP patients or the Internet for men.</AbstractText>"}

However, the impact of gene-environment interactions on phenotypic traits mostly remains elusive. To address this, we feed 1154 mice of an autoimmunity-prone intercross line (AIL) three different diets. We find that diet substantially contributes to the variability of complex traits and unmasks additional genetic susceptibility quantitative trait loci (QTL). By performing whole-genome sequencing of the AIL founder strains, we resolve these QTLs to few or single candidate genes. To address whether diet can also modulate genetic predisposition towards a given trait, we set NZM2410/J mice on similar dietary regimens as AIL mice. Our data suggest that diet modifies genetic susceptibility to lupus and shifts intestinal bacterial and fungal community composition, which precedes clinical disease manifestation. Collectively, our study underlines the importance of including environmental factors in genetic association studies.</AbstractText>"}

In this manuscript, we report the role of L-lactate in stress resistance and cell survival mechanisms using neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) as well as the C. elegans model. We observed that L-lactate promotes cellular defense mechanisms, including Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), by promoting a mild Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) burst. This increase in ROS triggers antioxidant defenses and pro-survival pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) chaperones. These results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in beneficial effects of L-lactate, involving mild ROS burst, leading to activation of unfolded protein responses and detoxification mechanisms. We present evidence that this hormetic mechanism induced by L-lactate protects against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. This work contributes to the identification of molecular mechanisms, which could serve as targets for future therapeutic approaches for cell protection and aging-related disorders.</AbstractText>"}

Previous studies reported seven methylation variable positions (MVPs) robustly associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their causal roles in T2DM are unclear. In an incident T2DM case-cohort study nested within the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort, we used whole blood DNA collected at baseline, up to 11 years before T2DM onset, to investigate the role of methylation in the etiology of T2DM. We identified 15 novel MVPs with robust associations with incident T2DM and robustly confirmed three MVPs identified previously (near to <i>TXNIP</i>, <i>ABCG1</i>, and <i>SREBF1</i>). All 18 MVPs showed directionally consistent associations with incident and prevalent T2DM in independent studies. Further conditional analyses suggested that the identified epigenetic signals appear related to T2DM via glucose and obesity-related pathways acting before the collection of baseline samples. We integrated genome-wide genetic data to identify methylation-associated quantitative trait loci robustly associated with 16 of the 18 MVPs and found one MVP, cg00574958 at <i>CPT1A</i>, with a possible direct causal role in T2DM.

In an extensive review of the literature, we found that GFR declines with healthy aging without any overt signs of compensation (such as elevated single-nephron GFR) or kidney damage. Older living kidney donors, who are carefully selected based on good health, have a lower predonation GFR compared with younger donors. Furthermore, the results from the large meta-analyses conducted by the CKD Prognosis Consortium and from numerous other studies indicate that the GFR threshold above which the risk of mortality is increased is not consistent across all ages. Among younger persons, mortality is increased at GFR &lt;75 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, whereas in elderly people it is increased at levels &lt;45 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> Therefore, we suggest that amending the CKD definition to include age-specific thresholds for GFR. The implications of an updated definition are far reaching. Having fewer healthy elderly individuals diagnosed with CKD could help reduce inappropriate care and its associated adverse effects. Global prevalence estimates for CKD would be substantially reduced. Also, using an age-specific threshold for younger persons might lead to earlier identification of CKD onset for such individuals, at a point when progressive kidney damage may still be preventable.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Since the SLC5A8 protein could not be detected in the mouse brain, it was hypothesized that the leukoencephalopathy of aging SLC5A8-deficient mice was caused by the absence of slc5a8 expression in a peripheral organ, i.e. the kidney, where SLC5A8 is strongly expressed. A hyper-excretion of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the urine of SLC5A8-deficient mice was observed and showed that SLC5A8-deficient mice suffered a cerebral BHB insufficiency.

Significant differences were evident post-alcoholic fermentation and after 24 months of ageing with regards to the number of wine compositional variables, in particular the concentration of tannin and polysaccharide. Strain L2323 is known for its pectinolytic activity and yielded the highest concentration of both yeast- and grape-derived polysaccharides. Wines made with the mannoprotein-producing strain Uvaferm HPS (high levels of polysaccharides) did not have elevated concentrations of yeast-derived polysaccharides, despite this observation being made for corresponding model fermentations, suggesting that mannoprotein production or retention might be limited by the wine matrix. Wine tannin concentration showed a high level of variability between strains, with L2323 having the highest, and AWRI1503 the lowest concentration. Sensory analysis of the wines after 24 months ageing revealed significant differences between the yeast strains, but only the attributes <i>opacity</i> (visual colour) and <i>astringency</i> could be predicted by partial least squares regression using the wine compositional data. Notably, the <i>astringency</i> attribute was associated with higher concentrations of both tannin and polysaccharide, contrary to reports in the literature which suggested that polysaccharide exerts a moderating effect on astringency. The results confirm previous reports demonstrating that the choice of yeast strain represents an opportunity to shape wine style outcomes.</AbstractText>"}

Abscisic acid (ABA) strongly induces senescence and endogenous ABA levels are finely tuned by many senescence-associated TFs. Here, we report on the regulatory function of the senescence-induced TF OsWRKY5 TF in rice (<i>Oryza</i><i>sativa</i>). <i>OsWRKY5</i> expression was rapidly upregulated in senescing leaves, especially in yellowing sectors initiated by aging or dark treatment. A T-DNA insertion activation-tagged <i>OsWRKY5</i>-overexpressing mutant (termed <i>oswrky5-D</i>) promoted leaf senescence under natural and dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions. By contrast, a T-DNA insertion <i>oswrky5</i>-knockdown mutant (termed <i>oswrky5</i>) retained leaf greenness during DIS. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that <i>OsWRKY5</i> upregulates the expression of genes controlling chlorophyll degradation and leaf senescence. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY5 indirectly upregulates the expression of senescence-associated <i>NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2</i> (<i>NAC</i>) genes including <i>OsNAP</i> and <i>OsNAC2</i>. Precocious leaf yellowing in the <i>oswrky5-D</i> mutant might be caused by elevated endogenous ABA concentrations resulting from upregulated expression of ABA biosynthesis genes <i>OsNCED3</i>, <i>OsNCED4</i>, and <i>OsNCED5</i>, indicating that OsWRKY is a positive regulator of ABA biosynthesis during leaf senescence. Furthermore, <i>OsWRKY5</i> expression was suppressed by ABA treatment. Taken together, <i>OsWRKY5</i> is a positive regulator of leaf senescence that upregulates senescence-induced <i>NAC</i>, ABA biosynthesis, and chlorophyll degradation genes.</AbstractText>"}

Despite various advancements in the field of regenerative medicine, it remains a challenge to remedy articular cartilage defects resulting from trauma, aging, or osteoarthritis. Among various approaches, tissue engineering using tailored electroactive scaffolds has evolved as a promising strategy to repair damaged cartilage tissue. In this approach, hydrogel scaffolds are used as artificial extracellular matrices, and electric stimulation is applied to facilitate proliferation, differentiation, and cell growth at the defect site. In this regard, we present a simulation model of electroactive hydrogels to be used for cartilage-tissue engineering employing open-source finite-element software FEniCS together with a Python interface. The proposed mathematical formulation was first validated with an example from the literature.

An AA2524 alloy was pre-aged at 180 °C to obtain S'/S precipitates with various sizes. The results showed that the precipitate size increased approximately linearly to ≈32 nm, ≈60 nm, and ≈105 nm after 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h of pre-aging, respectively. The growth of precipitate could significantly shorten the primary creep stage, despite the fact that the steady-state creep behavior was similar to that of the as-received alloy, as revealed by the macro tensile creep tests at 180 °C and 180 MPa. This led to a stress exponent (2.4-2.5) of the Al alloy with various precipitate sizes that was quite close to that of the as-received Al alloy, implying a steady-state creep mechanism dominated by grain boundary sliding and dislocation interactions. Finally, the micro-creep tests showed a minor role of the precipitate size on the steady-state creep mechanism, as evidenced by the similar strain rate sensitivity (0.0169-0.0186), activation volume (≈27 b<sup>3</sup>), and the results of a detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of all tested alloys.</AbstractText>"}

TXNIP (Thioredoxin-interacting protein) is a key mediator of diabetic β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction in diabetes, and thus, its regulation represents a therapeutic target. Recent studies have reported that p90RSK is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and nephropathy. In this study, we used FMK (a p90RSK inhibitor) to determine whether inhibition of p90RSK protects β-cells from chronic HG-induced TXNIP expression and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of FMK on its expression. In INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, HG-induced β-cell dysfunction, apoptosis, and ROS generation were significantly diminished by FMK. In contrast BI-D1870 (another p90RSK inhibitor) did not attenuate HG-induced TXNIP promoter activity or TXNIP expression. In addition, HG-induced nuclear translocation of ChREBP and its transcriptional target molecules were found to be regulated by FMK. These results demonstrate that HG-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction resulting in HG conditions is associated with TXNIP expression, and that FMK is responsible for HG-stimulated TXNIP gene expression by inactivating the regulation of ChREBP in pancreatic β-cells. Taken together, these findings suggest FMK may protect against HG-induced β-cell dysfunction and TXNIP expression by ChREBP regulation in pancreatic β-cells, and that FMK is a potential therapeutic reagent for the drug development of diabetes and its complications.</AbstractText>"}

This is a retrospective comparative study from 2007 to 2016 at a single tertiary care center. A consecutive sample of patients undergoing surgery for aging of the upper face was included in the study. Surgeries deemed to be inclusive were endoscopic browlift, upper blepharoplasty, and lower blepharoplasty. In total, 46 patients undergoing endoscopic browlift with concurrent blepharoplasty were included. Patient demographics, past medical history, follow-up, and any complications related to their surgery were studied up to 90 months postoperatively. Combination of endoscopic browlift with blepharoplasty did not increase the risk of complications on univariate analysis (<i>p</i> = 0.735). There were no differences in complication rates on univariate analysis of patients with a smoking history, diabetes, or autoimmune disease (<i>p</i> = 0.111, <i>p</i> = 0.575, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.999, respectively). Furthermore, there was no difference between groups in complication rates, smoking history, diabetes, or autoimmune disease (<i>p</i> = 0.735, <i>p</i> = 0.181, <i>p</i> = 0.310, <i>p</i> = 0.218, respectively). Smoking had an insignificant increased risk of complication as compared with nonsmokers on multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 4.526; <i>p</i> = 0.073). Increasing age was slightly associated with fewer complications on multivariate analysis in this patient cohort (OR = 0.939; <i>p</i> = 0.048). By combining endoscopic browlift with a concomitant blepharoplasty, the goals of the patient and the standards of the surgeon can be effectively and safely achieved.

SDF-1 plays a vital role in BMSC migration, survival, and differentiation. Our group previously reported the role of SDF-1 in osteogenic differentiation in vitro and bone formation in vivo; however, our understanding of the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of SDF-1 remains poor. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of protein-coding genes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of miR-141-3p on SDF-1 expression in BMSCs and its importance in the aging bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Our data demonstrated that murine and human BMSCs expressed miR-141-3p that repressed SDF-1 gene expression at the functional level (luciferase reporter assay) by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of mRNA. We also found that transfection of miR-141-3p decreased osteogenic markers in human BMSCs. Our results demonstrate that miR-141-3p expression increases with age, while SDF-1 decreases in both the human and mouse BM niche. Taken together, these results support that miR-141-3p is a novel regulator of SDF-1 in bone cells and plays an important role in the age-dependent pathophysiology of murine and human BM niche.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2018.

Territory refers to an area of ownership that is controlled on a daily basis and is fundamental to one's daily life. Lonely individuals often manage boundaries by gaining greater control over their physical environment by territorial behavior. They guard personal territory well as the only area where they can exert dominance and feel safe. Perceptions of social isolation or loneliness increase vigilance for threats, decrease trust, and heighten feelings of vulnerability. Clinical teams caring for the lonely must be especially attentive to a history of prior trauma. Clinicians who ask permission, who pay attention to nonverbal cues, distance, and speed as they enter the lonely person's space, and who respect boundaries may be more successful in gaining trust. Achieving trust diminishes the risk of physical harm, while allowing lonely persons the perceived control they need to permit health care interventions. Veterans are at higher risk for loneliness. Given their military training, they may be particularly attentive to boundaries, protecting the perimeter, watching for threats, and defending their space. In this article, we discuss the successful mental health treatment of a lonely male veteran in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, by paying attention to the 4 Ts of loneliness. We used a 4-step approach of validation, mentalization, reality testing, and socialization to decrease the sense of threat as we sought acceptance to the patient's territory, followed by building trust and working on past trauma.</AbstractText>"}

First, happiness is not merely the mirror of depression, anxiety or distress, but has distinct relationships with a range of outcomes, so benefits from study in itself. Second, happiness appears to be a protective factor for morbidity and mortality; although studies are complex and take a long time to complete, there is accumulating evidence that greater happiness predicts survival among older people independently of covariates including health status and depression. Third, happiness has broad ramifications at older ages, being related to personal and social relationships, economic prosperity, biological risk factors, health behaviours, and time use as well as health. Fourth, happiness is malleable, and can potentially be modified in ways that will enhance the health and well-being of older people.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

The regulatory role of SUMOylation, the attachment of a small ubiquitin-related modifier to a target protein, has been implicated in fundamental processes like cell division, DNA damage repair, mitochondrial homeostasis, and stress responses. Recently, it is gaining more attention in drug discovery as well. As life expectancy keeps rising, more individuals are at risk for developing age-associated diseases. This not only makes a person's life uncomfortable, but it also places an economic burden on society. Therefore, finding treatments for age-related diseases is an important issue. Understanding the basic mechanisms in the cell under normal and disease conditions is fundamental for drug discovery. There is an increasing number of reports showing that the ageing process could be influenced by SUMOylation. Similarly, SUMOylation is essential for proper neuronal function. In this review we summarize the latest results regarding the connection between SUMOylation and neurodegenerative diseases.

The effects of military service on mental health and well-being may be more pronounced later in life among those who served in Vietnam than prior cohorts of veterans. Many veterans confront and rework their wartime memories later in life in an attempt to find meaning and coherence, engaging in a process referred to as Later-Adulthood Trauma Reengagement (LATR). LATR often occurs in the context of other stressors that are a normative part of aging, such as role transitions (e.g., retirement), declines in physical health, and the death of close others (e.g., spouses), perhaps because these events trigger reminiscence. Importantly, LATR may result in either positive (e.g., acceptance) or negative (e.g., distress) psychological outcomes. It has been suggested that the presence of social/environmental resources, including socioemotional support, may aid veterans in successfully navigating LATR. We, therefore, review relevant areas of research to delineate the role that various layers of social context may play in -helping - or hindering - aging Vietnam veterans as they navigate LATR in the context of normative late-life stressors.

This enzyme was isolated by a very mild procedure allowing its analyses under quasi-native conditions. The isolated complex appeared as a red coloured homo-trimer, suggesting the retention of at least one of the typical carotenoids from C. annuum. Moreover, the protein complex was co-purified with a non-proteinaceous fraction of carotenoid aggregates carrying a high molecular weight and separable only by Size Exclusion Chromatography. This last finding suggested a relationship between the carotenoids synthesis on chromoplast membranes, the presence, and storage of organised carotenoids aggregates typical for chromoplasts. Further MS analyses also provided important hints on the interactome network associated to the capsanthin/capsorubin synthase, confirming its functional relevance during ripening.

SIRT2 is the only sirtuin protein which is predominantly found in the cytoplasm but is also found in the mitochondria and in the nucleus. Recently, accumulating evidence has uncovered a growing number of substrates and additional detailed functions of SIRT2 in a wide range of biological processes, marking its crucial role. Here, we give a comprehensive profile of the crucial physiological functions of SIRT2 and its role in neurological diseases, cancers, and other diseases. This review summarizes the functions of SIRT2 in the nervous system, mitosis regulation, genome integrity, cell differentiation, cell homeostasis, aging, infection, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy. SIRT2 inhibition rescues neurodegenerative disease symptoms and hence SIRT2 is a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disease. SIRT2 is undoubtedly dysfunctional in cancers and plays a dual-faced role in different types of cancers, and although its mechanism is unresolved, SIRT2 remains a promising therapeutic target for certain cancers. In future, the continued rapid growth in SIRT2 research will help clarify its role in human health and disease, and promote the progress of this target in clinical practice.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Resistance training is an effective method to attenuate age-related functional declines. Based on the findings that muscle power and explosive strength are strongly associated with functional performance in older adults, it has been suggested that fast-intended-velocity resistance training may elicit greater improvements in functional capacity when compared to moderate-velocity resistance training. However, currently, there is no high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis supporting this assertion. The present study compared the magnitude of functional capacity improvements following resistance training performed with fast-intentional velocity versus moderate velocity. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to January 2019. The following eligibility criteria for selecting studies was adopted: Participants aged ≥60 years; resistance training based intervention for lower limbs performed solely with slow to moderate concentric velocity (≥2 s for each concentric phase) or solely with the intention of maximising velocity (i.e., as fast as possible); and at least one functional test for lower limbs, with pre- and post-intervention measurements. When studies employed multiple functional tests, a single (pooled) standardised mean difference was calculated and presented as combined functional capacity. In addition, functional tests were grouped accordingly to their specificity for the sub-groups meta-analyses. Fifteen studies were selected (high quality, n = 3; and pre-registered, n = 2). The results presented heterogeneity and small-studies publication bias, leading to a biased advantage for fast-intended-velocity resistance training (95%CI = 0.18, 0.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 45%). Short physical performance battery indicated an advantage for fast-intended-velocity resistance training (95%CI = 0.10, 0.94; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). There was no difference for timed up and go (95%CI = -0.07, 0.94; I<sup>2</sup> = 48%), 30-s chair stand (95%CI = -0.24, 1.39; I<sup>2</sup> = 71%), 5-times chair stand (95%CI = -1.63, 1.27; I<sup>2</sup> = 57%) stair climb (95%CI = -1.89, 2.81; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), short walk (95%CI = -0.99, 0.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 21%) and long walk (95%CI = -0.59, 1.00; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). These results suggest that there is inconclusive evidence to support the superiority of fast-intended-velocity resistance training to improve functional capacity when compared to moderate-velocity resistance training. These results may have been influenced by the lack of high-quality and pre-registered studies, high heterogeneity, and small-studies publication bias.

Mutations in RDH12 have been linked to Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. A number of in-vitro studies have shown that mutations in RDH12 result in little or no enzyme activity.

We used Kendall's tau-b (τb) test to determine the correlation between time and hip fracture IRs, and calculated both the annual % change in IRs and the % change in IR compared to the baseline period (2006 to 2008). The registry recorded 6985 hip fractures, 74% at the femoral neck, 23% intertrochanteric, and 3% subtrochanteric.

IRs steadily increased with age, and IR ratios increased in parallel in both sexes, with a steeper and earlier rise (by 5 years) in women.

A major concern after THA is reducing infection rates, as infections can cause devastating complications. Improved sterile technique, standardized infection control protocols, and novel dressings have been used to reduce postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs). The use of either silver-impregnated dry dressings or easily applied incisional negative pressure dressings is aimed at reducing the rates of SSIs after primary anterior THA. The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 275 patients who underwent anterior THA at their institution during a 1-year period. Patients were separated into groups based on their surgical dressing. Rates of SSI were documented, and the effects of various factors, including age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities, were compared between the 2 cohorts. The authors also analyzed high-risk patients to determine whether easily applied incisional negative pressure dressings reduced infections. The use of easily applied incisional negative pressure dressings after primary anterior THA did not have a statistically significant impact on SSI rate (P=.42). There was also no difference in SSI, readmission, or reoperation in the high-risk group. The goal of using an incisional negative pressure wound therapy device is to help further decrease the risk of SSI. This study's findings suggest that the SSI rate in this group did not differ from that in the standard dressing group, such that the prophylactic use of a negative pressure wound therapy device is not indicated for either standard or high-risk patients undergoing primary anterior approach THA.

Each case had a complete USSLB staging and at least 1 full research clinical assessment, including subspecialty neurologist-administered movement and cognitive evaluation. Of the 280, 25.7% were cognitively normal, 8.6% had mild cognitive impairment, and 65.7% had dementia. All cases could be categorized into 1 of 5 USSLB stages (8.6% stage I-olfactory bulb only; 15.4% IIa-brainstem predominant; 13.6% IIb-limbic predominant; 31.8% III-brainstem and limbic; and 30.7% IV-neocortical) yet using the Braak staging system 70 cases (25.3%) could not be classified. Those with USSLB stages III and IV died at a younger age. Multiple measures of motor parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, hyposmia, and probable RBD were significantly correlated with increasing USSLB stage. We conclude that the USSLB is the most comprehensive staging system for all Lewy body disorders and allows for categorization and ranking of all brains with significant correlations to many motor and nonmotor clinical signs and symptoms.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Rodent studies show similar hyperphosphorylation in the developing brain, which may be involved in regulating axonal growth and plasticity, but detailed human studies are lacking. Here, we examine tau phosphorylation by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting in human fetal and adult autopsy brain tissue. Of the 20 cases with sufficient tissue preservation, 18 (90%) showed positive staining for S214 (pSer214), with the majority also positive for CP13 (pSer202), and PHF-1 (pSer396/pSer404). AT8 (pSer202/pThr205) and RZ3 (pThr231) were largely negative while PG5 (pSer409) was negative in all cases. Immunoblotting showed tau monomers with a similar staining pattern. We also observed phospho-tau aggregates in the fetal molecular layer, staining positively for S214, CP13, and PHF1 and negative for thioflavin S. These corresponded to high-molecular weight (∼150 kD) bands seen on Western blots probed with S214, PHF1, and PG5. We therefore conclude that fetal phosphorylation overlaps with AD in some residues, while others (e.g. T231, S409) appear to be unique to AD, and that tau is capable of forming nontoxic aggregates in the developing brain. These findings suggest that the fetal brain is resilient to formation of toxic aggregates, the mechanism for which may yield insights into the pathogenesis of tau aggregation and toxicity in the aging brain.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

In response to mitochondrial damage, activated PINK1 can promote mitophagy, an autophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria, by cooperating with Parkin ubiquitin ligase. Loss-of-function of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy results in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which could be one etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Within step-by-step signaling cascades of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, mitochondrial damage-dependent PINK1 kinase activation is a critical step to trigger the mitophagy signal. Recent investigation of this process reveals that this stress-dependent PINK1 kinase activation is achieved by its regulated import into different mitochondrial compartments. Thus, PINK1 import regulation stands at an important crossroad to determine the mitochondrial fate - 'keep' or 'remove'? In this review, we will summarize how the PINK1 import is regulated in a mitochondrial health status-dependent manner and how this process could be pharmacologically modulated to activate the PINK1/Parkin pathway.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) forms aggregates mainly in neurons in PD and DLB, while oligodendroglial α-Syn aggregates are characteristic of MSA. Recent studies have demonstrated that injections of synthetic α-Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the brains of wild-type (WT) animals induce intraneuronal α-Syn aggregates and the subsequent interneuronal transmission of α-Syn aggregates. However, injections of α-Syn PFFs or even brain lysates of patients with MSA have not been reported to induce oligodendroglial α-Syn aggregates, raising questions about the pathogenesis of oligodendroglial α-Syn aggregates in MSA. Here, we report that WT mice injected with mouse α-Syn (m-α-Syn) PFFs develop neuronal α-Syn pathology after short postinjection (PI) intervals on the scale of weeks, while oligodendroglial α-Syn pathology emerges after longer PI intervals of several months. Abundant oligodendroglial α-Syn pathology in white matter at later time points is reminiscent of MSA. Furthermore, comparison between young and aged mice injected with m-α-Syn PFFs revealed that PI intervals rather than aging correlate with oligodendroglial α-Syn aggregation. These results provide novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of oligodendroglial α-Syn aggregation in MSA.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Alternatively, these types of cancers could also be indirectly stimulated by HPV-induced chronic inflammations, which in turn are also caused by HPV oncogenes activity. Chronic inflammation is associated with repeated tissue injury and development of mutations in the vital tumor suppressor genes. Thus, it is important to understand that the persistent HPV infection and its associated chronic inflammation is responsible for the progression of HPV-induced cancers. HPV E5, E6 and E7 could upregulate the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin (PG) E2 followed by the activation of the COX-PG pathway. This pathway is assumed to be the main cause of HPV-induced inflammation. Additionally, HPV oncogenes could have an impact on the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HPV-positive patients. The upregulation of such cytokines accelerates the incidence of inflammation following HPV infection. Other factors such as microRNAs, which are involved in the inflammation pathways and aging, give rise to the increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and could also be responsible for the acceleration of HPV-induced inflammation and consequent cervical cancer. In this review, the exact roles of HPV oncogenes in the occurrence of inflammation in cervical tissue, and the effects of other factors in this event are evaluated.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© FEMS 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Moreover, inactivating mutations in type 2 deiodinase (DIO2), the major TH-activating enzyme, have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in both humans and mice. We studied the link between Dio2 deficiency and glucose homeostasis in fasted males of two different Dio2 knockout (KO) zebrafish lines. Young adult Dio2KO zebrafish (6 to 9 months) were hyperglycemic. Both insulin and glucagon expression were increased, whereas β and α cell numbers in the main pancreatic islet were similar to those in wild-types. Insulin receptor expression in skeletal muscle was decreased at 6 months, accompanied by a strong downregulation of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase expression. Blood glucose levels in Dio2KO zebrafish, however, normalized around 1 year of age. Older mutants (18 to 24 months) were normoglycemic, and increased insulin and glucagon expression was accompanied by a prominent increase in pancreatic islet size and β and α cell numbers. Older Dio2KO zebrafish also showed strongly decreased expression of glucagon receptors in the gastrointestinal system as well as decreased expression of glucose transporters GLUT2 and GLUT12, glucose-6-phosphatase, and glycogen synthase 2. This study shows that Dio2KO zebrafish suffer from transient hyperglycemia, which is counteracted with increasing age by a prominent hyperplasia of the endocrine pancreas together with decreases in hepatic glucagon sensitivity and intestinal glucose uptake. Further research on the mechanisms allowing compensation in older Dio2KO zebrafish may help to identify new therapeutic targets for (TH deficiency-related) hyperglycemia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal gland are particularly enriched in cholesteryl esters of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which constitute an important pool supplying cholesterol for steroid synthesis. The current studies addressed whether ACSL4 is required for normal steroidogenesis. CYP11A1 promoter‒mediated Cre was used to generate steroid tissue‒specific ACSL4 knockout (KO) mice. Results demonstrated that ACSL4 plays an important role in adrenal cholesteryl ester formation, as well as in determining the fatty acyl composition of adrenal cholesteryl esters, with ACSL4 deficiency leading to reductions in cholesteryl ester storage and alterations in cholesteryl ester composition. Statistically significant reductions in corticosterone and testosterone production, but not progesterone production, were observed in vivo, and these deficits were accentuated in ex vivo and in vitro studies of isolated steroid tissues and cells from ACSL4-deficient mice. However, these effects on steroid production appear to be due to reductions in cholesteryl ester stores rather than disturbances in signaling pathways. We conclude that ACSL4 is dispensable for normal steroidogenesis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It was shown that heating the column to 130°C does not affect the retention of the analytes. At temperatures above 130°C, the gradual decrease of the retention of analytes on PTMSP stationary phase is observed. The process is non-selective and proceeds at the same extent for all the studied hydrocarbons, regardless of the size and geometry of the molecule. Values of enthalpy and entropy of sorption of light hydrocarbons are determined for the original column and after its aging at 200°C. The enthalpy of sorption of the analytes at the PTMSP phase is practically independent on the heating temperature of the PTMSP phase, whereas the loss of entropy increases after heating. The increase of the entropy factor after the heating of the PTMSP stationary phase is associated with its aging and is confirmed by the construction of compensation functions for treated and untreated columns.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

The Catechol-O-Methyltransferase polymorphism served as genetic proxy for endogenous prefrontal DA availability, and D2DRs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) were measured with [11C]raclopride-PET. Individuals for whom D2DR status matched DA availability showed higher levels of episodic and working-memory performance than individuals with insufficient or excessive DA availability relative to the number of receptors. A similar pattern restricted to episodic memory was observed for D2DRs in caudate. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during working-memory performance confirmed the importance of a balanced DA system for load-dependent brain activity in dlPFC.

Biological measures of aging may provide key advantages, allowing scientists focusing on age-related functional changes to use metrics derived from epigenetic factors like DNA methylation (DNAm), which could provide greater precision. Here we investigated the relationship between methylation-based age and an essential cognitive function that is known to exhibit age-related decline: selective attention. We found that DNAm-age predicted selective attention abilities and fully mediated the relationship between selective attention and chronological age. Using neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography, we found that gamma activity in the anterior cingulate was robustly predicted by DNAm-derived biological age, revealing the neural dynamics underlying this DNAm age-related cognitive decline. Anterior cingulate gamma activity also significantly predicted behavior on the selective attention task, indicating its functional relevance. These findings suggest that DNAm age may be a better predictor of cognitive and brain aging than more traditional chronological metrics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Earlier studies have shown that age-related deficits in cortical neural timing, which is clearly associated with speech perception, can be partially reversed with auditory training. However, whether training can reverse aged-related cortical changes in the domain of spatial processing has never been studied. In this study, we examined cortical spatial processing in ~21-month-old rats that were trained on a sound-azimuth discrimination task. We found that animals that experienced 1 month of training displayed sharper cortical sound-azimuth tuning when compared to the age-matched untrained controls. This training-induced remodeling in spatial tuning was paralleled by increases of cortical parvalbumin-labeled inhibitory interneurons. However, no measurable changes in cortical spatial processing were recorded in age-matched animals that were passively exposed to training sounds with no task demands. These results that demonstrate the effects of training on cortical spatial domain processing in the rodent model further support the notion that age-related changes in central neural process are, due to their plastic nature, reversible. Moreover, the results offer the encouraging possibility that behavioral training might be used to attenuate declines in auditory perception, which are commonly observed in older individuals.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

However, no study has compared the effects of particles generated from passenger tires with the effects of particles from truck tires. The aim of this study was to investigate and relate the cyto- and genotoxic effects of different types of particles (PP, passenger tire particles vs. TP, truck tire particles) in vitro using the phagocytic cell line RAW 264.7 (mouse leukaemic monocyte macrophage cell line). The viability of RAW 264.7 cells was determined by the 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -5- (3-carboxymethoxyphenyl) -2- (4-sulfophenyl) -2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay following exposure for 4, 24 and 48 hours to different particle concentrations (10 μg / ml, 25 μg / ml, 50 μg / ml, 100 μg / ml). The effects of particles of passenger and truck tires on cell proliferation and genotoxicity were evaluated by means of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay following exposure for 24 hours to different particle concentrations (10 μg / ml, 25 μg / ml, 50 μg / ml, 100 μg / ml). In MTS assay, after 24 hours, it was found that PP induced a 30% decrease in metabolic activity at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, while TP caused reductions of 20% and 10% at concentrations of 10 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively. At 48 hours after the treatments, we observed increased metabolic activity at 50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml for the PP while only at 50 μg/ml for the TP. The CBMN assay showed a significant increase in the number of micronuclei in the cells incubated with PP in all experimental conditions, while the cells treated with TP showed a meaningful increase only at 10 μg /ml. We utilized the TNF-α ELISA mouse test to detect the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in RAW 264.7 cells. The effect of passenger and truck particles on TNF-α release was evaluated following exposure for 4 and 24 hours. After 4 hours of incubation, the cells treated with PP and TP at 100 μg / ml showed a slight but significant increase in TNF-α release, while there was a significant increase in the release of TNF-α after 24 hours of incubation with both tire samples in the cells treated with 50 and 100 μg / ml PP. The data obtained show a higher cytotoxic, clastogenic/genotoxic and inflammatory effects of passenger compared to the truck tire particles.</AbstractText>"}

We studied the seed traits and germination strategy of eight woody plant species to investigate regeneration strategies in the arid zone of eastern Australia. To cope with stochastic and minimal rainfall, we predict that arid seeds will either have rapid germination across a wide range of temperatures, improved germination under cooler temperatures, or dormancy and/or longevity traits to delay or stagger germination across time. To understand how temperature affects germination responses, seeds of eight keystone arid species were germinated under laboratory conditions, and under three diurnal temperatures (30/20°C, 25/15°C and 17/7°C) for 30 days. We also tested for decline in seed viability across 24 months in a dry-aging treatment (~20°C). Six of the eight arid species studied had non-dormant, rapidly germinating seeds, and only two species had physiological dormancy traits. Seed longevity differed widely between species, from one recalcitrant species surviving only months in aging (P50 = &lt;3 months) and one serotinous species surviving for many years (P50 = 84 months). Our results highlight the importance of understanding the reproductive strategies of plant species in arid environments. Rapid germination, the dominant seed trait of species included in this study, allows arid species to capitalise on sporadic rainfall. However, some species also exhibit dormancy and delayed germination; this an alternative strategy which spreads the risk of germination failure over time.</AbstractText>"}

As the key component of the OCT, the reliability of the optical current sensor (OCS) largely determines the reliability level of the OCT. This paper proposes a reliability assessment method of the OCS based on accelerated aging tests. The failure modes and failure mechanisms of the OCS are analyzed, and the concept of OCS insertion loss variation is proposed. An allowable range of insertion loss variation is selected as the failure criterion of the OCS. From the viewpoint of the OCS measurement error generated by the quantization error of the analog-to-digital converter, the allowable range of insertion loss variation is obtained. By selecting a high temperature as the accelerated thermal stress, we design the accelerated aging test scheme of the OCS and analyze the sample test data to obtain the activation energy of the OCS insertion loss failure. Based on this activation energy, the median time to failure and instantaneous failure rate curve of the OCS at normal temperature are obtained. The results indicate that the designed OCS has an expected service life of 50 years and a low instantaneous failure rate at normal temperature. This paper provides basic critical reliability analysis data for the system reliability assessment of OCTs.</AbstractText>"}

The <i>Sir2/Sirt1</i> gene overexpression delays cell aging and reduces obesity and oxidative stress. Exercise improves heart function and delays heart aging. However, it remains unclear whether exercise delaying heart aging is related to cardiac <i>Sir2/Sirt1</i>-related pathways. In this study, cardiac <i>dSir2</i> overexpression or knockdown was regulated using the UAS/hand-Gal4 system in <i>Drosophila</i>. Flies underwent exercise interventions from 4 weeks to 5 weeks old.

Either cardiac <i>dSir2</i> knockdown or aging had almost opposite effects on the heart as those of cardiac <i>dSir2</i> overexpression. Therefore, we claim that cardiac <i>dSir2</i> overexpression or knockdown delayed or promoted heart aging by reducing or increasing age-related oxidative stress, lipid accumulation, diastolic dysfunction, and contractility debility. The activation of cardiac <i>dSir2/Foxo/</i>SOD and <i>dSir2/Foxo/bmm</i> pathways may be two important molecular mechanisms through which exercise works against heart aging in <i>Drosophila</i>.</AbstractText>"}

A strategy involving welfare technology is presented as one such solution. An important group to carry out this strategy involves those who work with welfare technology in municipal eldercare. In this paper we describe their perception of welfare technology, and the challenges and opportunities they perceive in utilizing it. <b>Methods:</b> A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to all Swedish municipalities and answered by 393 respondents. Analyses show that the respondents were representative of the different professions who work with welfare technology within municipal eldercare. <b>Results:</b> Welfare technology was perceived as being more reliable and safer than humans with regards to supervisions and reminders. The respondents acknowledged factors that slowed down the implementation of welfare technology in municipal eldercare organizations, such as resistance to change, lack of finances, lack of supporting evidence, lack of infrastructure, high staff turnover, difficulties with procurement and uncertainties about responsibility and laws. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found that the people who work with and make decisions about welfare technology in municipal eldercare organizations were generally very positive about the deployment and use of such technology, but there appear to be problems within municipal eldercare organizations to realize this vision. The lack of structured implementation processes and coherent evaluation models indicates inequality of the access to welfare technology and, as a result, even though Swedish eldercare is publicly funded, the availability of welfare technologies and their usage differ between municipalities. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION The research findings show that implementing welfare technologies in municipal eldercare must include transformed working processes and long-term strategies or they may lead to conflicts of priorities or unstructured implementation processes. Structured implementation processes and coherent evaluation models are needed for equality of access and availability of welfare technologies in municipal eldercare. High staff turnover negatively affects the deployment of welfare technology and the root cause of high staff turnover needs to be addressed.</AbstractText>"}

Injury classification into traumatic versus nontraumatic and tendinopathy, partial or full-thickness tears helps to establish a treatment plan. RTC injury rehabilitation protocols are criteria-based, multimodal, and divided into four phases. The acute phase addresses pain, inflammation, ROM, and RTC protection. The recovery phase addresses kinetic chain abnormalities, flexibility, and strength, and the functional phase involves exercises directed toward specific sport activities. Return to sports is based on clinical recovery, kinetic chain principles, and adequate sports technique.

Cellular senescence acts as a barrier against cancer progression and plays an important role in tumor suppression. Senescence associated long noncoding RNAs (SAL-RNAs) are thought to be critical regulators of cancer development. Here, the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) myocardial infarction-associated transcript <i>(miat</i>) was first identified as an HCC specific SALncRNA. Knockdown of <i>miat</i> significantly promoted cellular senescence and inhibited HCC progression. Mechanistic study revealed that SAL-<i>miat</i> acted as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that upregulated the expression of <i>sirt1</i> by sponging <i>miR-22-3p</i>. Moreover, <i>miat</i> downregulation activated the tumor suppressor pathway (p53/<i>p21</i> and <i>p16</i>/pRb) and stimulated senescent cancer cells to secrete senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which contributed to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, and resulted in the suppression of HCC tumorigenesis. Together, our study provided mechanistic insights into a critical role of <i>miat</i> as a miRNA sponge in HCC cellular senescence, which might offer a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.</AbstractText>"}

Eighty-one healthy late middle-aged participants (mean age: 59.4 y; range: 50-69 y) were included. Cognitive fitness consisted of a composite score known to be sensitive to early subtle cognitive change. Lifestyle factors (referenced below as cognitive reserve factors; CRF) and affective state were determined through questionnaires, and sleep-wake quality was also assessed through actimetry. Allostatic load (AL) was determined through a large range of objective health measures. Generalized linear mixed models, controlling for sex and age, revealed that higher cognitive reserve and lower allostatic load are related to better cognitive efficiency. Crystallized intelligence, sympathetic nervous system functioning and lipid metabolism were the only sub-fields of CRF and AL to be significantly associated with cognition. These results show that previous lifestyle characteristics and current physiological status are simultaneously explaining variability in cognitive abilities in late midlife.

Therefore, maintaining the proper balance of ROS in cells is a key method to alleviate senescence. Recent studies have found that isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), a critical enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, participates in ROS generation and in cellular dysfunction that is induced by excessive levels of ROS. Loss of IDH2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction that promotes excessive ROS generation and the development of several diseases. The results of this study suggest that Idh2 plays an important role in cellular senescence. Idh2 deficiency resulted in senescence-associated phenotypes and increased levels of senescence marker proteins in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and tissues. Furthermore, excessive ROS were generated in Idh2-deficient conditions, promoting cellular senescence by inducing cell cycle arrest through cyclin-dependent kinase 2. These results indicate that loss of Idh2 is a critical factor in regulating cellular senescence. Taken together, our findings contribute to the field of senescence research and suggest that IDH2 is a potential target of future anti-senescence studies.</AbstractText>"}

Its fine balance in human organism is extremely important and is involved in a wide range of functions. We need to maintain its amount in human organism within range considered as physiological. This is particularly true for elderly people, and especially for 'frail' elderly people, whose systems and apparatuses are in a state of serious homeostatic precariousness. In fact, hypomagnesemia is involved in a very large range of pathological conditions (requiring multiple therapies) that could compromise elderly's autonomy. The aim of this review has been to go through the most important trials, in order to understand the direction taken by research during the last years and to detect the room for improvement in this field. We have tried to understand when magnesium content is truly physiological or pathological, and how we could prevent an inappropriately low magnesium intake in elderly people. First of all, we have remarked the absolute need of an adequate evaluation method for magnesium content in human organism. Current literature appropriately encourages the use of a synoptic assessment of magnesium serum concentration, urinary excretion, and dietary intake. We have also discussed the most important trials relating hypomagnesaemia with human pathology. Specific studies conducted on elderly patients have extensively demonstrated its decisive role in maintaining bone health, adequate glyco-metabolic compensation, a correct cardiac and vascular functional profile, and probably also a physiological psycho-cognitive profile. From the implications discussed above, therefore, it is essential to ensure physiological levels of magnesium in body, particularly in geriatric patient, itself more prone to a reduction in the level of cation. We have concluded, according to the literature, that the best way to prevent hypomagnesemia and its clinical implications in elderly subjects is represented by a proper diet (more fiber and complex carbohydrates, more vegetable proteins, less sugars and fats), which ensures an adequate supply of cation. If with diet alone (due to comorbidity or other concomitant factors) it has not been possible to guarantee suitable serum levels of cation, or in the case of a patient defined as 'frail elderly', a reintegration therapy (per os) will be undertaken, after a careful analysis of renal function.</AbstractText>"}

The hysteresis frequency dependence of ferroelectric materials has been well studied. However, the long-term dynamic behavior including aging has not been well documented due to the long time frame required to gather experimental data, but it is critical for understanding the lifespan of these materials in application. Previous work has shown that the hysteresis frequency dependence of dielectric properties can be accurately modeled in the time domain using fractional derivative operators applied on a large frequency bandwidth. Currently, the lowest frequencies tested have been restrained to the hysteresis cycle quasi-static threshold. Below this threshold, the hysteresis shape remains unchanged. This research expands the current knowledge by validating the use of fractional derivative operators in long-term aging models. The model data are experimentally validated using aged piezoelectric samples up to 10<sup>7</sup> s. These results confirm that the low and high dynamic dielectric material behaviors are linked and can be consequently modeled using fractional derivative operators.</AbstractText>"}

The photoluminescence (PL) of 1L-MoS<sub>2</sub> degrades due to aging-related defect formation. The passivation of these defects leads to substantial improvement in optical properties. Here, we report the enhancement of PL on aged 1L-MoS<sub>2</sub> by laser treatment. Using photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy in a gas-controlled environment, we show that the enhancement is associated with efficient adsorption of oxygen on existing sulfur vacancies preceded by removal of adsorbates from the sample's surface. Oxygen adsorption depletes negative charges, resulting in suppression of trions and improved neutral exciton recombination. The result is a 6- to 8-fold increase in PL emission. The laser treatment in this work does not cause any measurable damage to the sample as verified by Raman spectroscopy, which is important for practical applications. Surprisingly, the observed PL enhancement is reversible by both vacuum and ultrafast femtosecond excitation. While the former approach allows switching a designed micropattern on the sample ON and OFF, the latter provides a controllable mean for accurate PL tuning, which is highly desirable for optoelectronic and gas sensing applications.</AbstractText>"}

By knowing the nature of iron oxide shell with zero valent iron core, one can determine the chemical or physical behavior of core-shell nanostructures. Fe core-shell nanochains (NCs) were prepared through the reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions by sodium boro-hydride in aqueous solution at room atmosphere, and Fe NCs were further aged in water up to 240 min. XRD was used to study the structure of Fe NCs. Further analysis of core-shell nature of Fe NCs was done by TEM, results showed increase in thickness of oxide shell (from 2.5, 4, 6 to 10 nm) as water aging time increases (from 0 min, 120 min, 240 min to 360 min). The Raman spectroscopy was employed to study the oxide nature of Fe NCs. To further confirm the magnetite phase in Fe NCs, the Mössbauer spectroscopy was done on Fe NCs-0 and Fe NCs-6. Result shows the presence of magnetite in the sample before aging in water, and the sample after prolonged aging contains pure Hematite phase. It shows that prolonged water oxidation transforms the structure of shell of Fe NCs from mixture of Hematite and Magnetite in to pure hematite shell. The Magnetic properties of the Fe NCs were measured by VSM at 320 K. Because of high saturation magnetization (Ms) values, Fe NCs could be used as r<sub>2</sub> contrasts agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in near future.</AbstractText>"}

However, very few studies have examined their implementation in depth. The purpose of this research was to identify factors influencing the implementation of a FLS at three sites in Quebec, Canada. From 2013 to 2015, individual and group interviews focused on experiences of FLS stakeholders, including implementation committee members, coordinators, and orthopaedic surgeons and their teams. Emerging key implementation factors were triangulated with the FLS patients' clinico-administrative data. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided the analysis of perceived factors influencing four intervention outputs: investigation of FF risk (using the FRAX score), communication with the participant primary care provider, initiation of anti-osteoporosis medications (when relevant), and referral to organized fall prevention activities (either governmental or community based). Among the 454 FLS patients recruited to the intervention group, 83% were investigated for FF risk, communication with the primary care provider was established for 98% of the participants, 54% initiated medication, and 35% were referred to organized fall prevention activities. Challenges related to restricted rights to prescribe medication and access to organized fall prevention activities were reported. FLS coordinator characteristics to overcome those challenges included self-efficacy beliefs, knowledge of community resources, and professional background. This study highlighted the importance of enabling access to services for subsequent FF prevention, consolidating the coordinator's role to facilitate a more integrated intervention, and involving local leaders to promote the successful implementation of the FLS.</AbstractText>"}

Our objective was to determine relationships between the bivariate distribution of amyloid-β and tau on PET and established clinical syndromes that are relevant to cognitive ageing and dementia. All individuals in this study were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study of cognitive ageing, or the Mayo Alzheimer Disease Research Center, a longitudinal study of individuals recruited from clinical practice. We studied 1343 participants who had amyloid PET and tau PET from 2 April 2015 to 3 May 2019, and met criteria for membership in one of five clinical diagnostic groups: cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, probable dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer clinical syndrome. We examined these clinical groups in relation to the bivariate distribution of amyloid and tau PET values. Individuals were grouped into amyloid (A)/tau (T) quadrants based on previously established abnormality cut points of standardized uptake value ratio 1.48 (A) and 1.33 (T). Individual participants largely fell into one of three amyloid/tau quadrants: low amyloid and low tau (A-T-), high amyloid and low tau (A+T-), or high amyloid and high tau (A+T+). Seventy per cent of cognitively unimpaired and 74% of FTD participants fell into the A-T- quadrant. Participants with mild cognitive impairment spanned the A-T- (42%), A+T- (28%), and A+T+ (27%) quadrants. Probable dementia with Lewy body participants spanned the A-T- (38%) and A+T- (44%) quadrants. Most (89%) participants with Alzheimer clinical syndrome fell into the A+T+ quadrant. These data support several conclusions. First, among 1343 participants, abnormal tau PET rarely occurred in the absence of abnormal amyloid PET, but the reverse was common. Thus, with rare exceptions, amyloidosis appears to be required for high levels of 3R/4R tau deposition. Second, abnormal amyloid PET is compatible with normal cognition but highly abnormal tau PET is not. These two conclusions support a dynamic biomarker model in which Alzheimer's disease is characterized first by the appearance of amyloidosis and later by tauopathy, with tauopathy being the proteinopathy associated with clinical symptoms. Third, bivariate amyloid and tau PET relationships differed across clinical groups and thus have a role for clarifying the aetiologies underlying neurocognitive clinical syndromes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

Several molecules, such as α-tocopherol and retinoic acid, have been shown to improve skin condition and even counteract the effects of exogenous stress factors such as smoking on skin aging. This work describes the design and development of lipid nanoparticles containing antioxidant agents (α-tocopherol or retinoic acid) to protect human skin against pollutants. Namely, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared using different lipids (tristearin, compritol, precirol or suppocire) in the presence or absence of caprylic/capric triglycerides. The formulations were characterized by particle size analysis, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray diffraction, encapsulation efficiency, preliminary stability, in vitro cytotoxicity and protection against cigarette smoke. Nanostructured lipid carriers were found to reduce agglomerate formation and provided better dimensional stability, as compared to solid lipid nanoparticles, suggesting their suitability for antioxidant loading. Based on the preformulation study, tristearin-based nanostructured lipid carriers loaded with α-tocopherol were selected for ex vivo studies since they displayed superior physico-chemical properties as compared to the other nanostructured lipid carriers compositions. Human skin explants were treated with α-tocopherol-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers and then exposed to cigarette smoke, and the protein levels of the stress-induced enzyme heme oxygenase were analyzed in skin homogenates. Interestingly, it was found that pretreatment with the nanoformulation resulted in significantly reduced heme oxygenase upregulation as compared to control samples, suggesting a protective effect provided by the nanoparticles.</AbstractText>"}

Cross-sectional studies have shown that excess body fat is associated with decreased adipose lipid removal rates<sup>2,3</sup>. Whether lipid turnover is constant over the life span or changes during long-term weight increase or loss is unknown. We determined the turnover of fat cell lipids in adults followed for up to 16 years, by measuring the incorporation of nuclear bomb test-derived <sup>14</sup>C in adipose tissue triglycerides. Lipid removal rate decreases during aging, with a failure to reciprocally adjust the rate of lipid uptake resulting in weight gain. Substantial weight loss is not driven by changes in lipid removal but by the rate of lipid uptake in adipose tissue. Furthermore, individuals with a low baseline lipid removal rate are more likely to remain weight-stable after weight loss. Therefore, lipid turnover adaptation might be important for maintaining pronounced weight loss. Together these findings identify adipose lipid turnover as an important factor for the long-term development of overweight/obesity and weight loss maintenance in humans.</AbstractText>"}

However, their reliability remains a major concern, as even the most stable devices reported so far degrade within only a few years<sup>4-8</sup>. This has led to the belief that short operational lifetimes are an intrinsic disadvantage of devices that are fabricated using weakly bonded organic materials-an idea that persists despite the rapid growth and acceptance of organic light-emitting devices, which can achieve lifetimes of several million hours<sup>9</sup>. Here we study an extremely stable class of thermally evaporated single-junction organic photovoltaic cells. We accelerated the ageing process by exposing the packaged cells to white-light illumination intensities of up to 37 Suns. The cells maintained more than 87 per cent of their starting efficiency after exposure for more than 68 days. The degradation rate increases superlinearly with intensity, leading to an extrapolated intrinsic lifetime, T<sub>80</sub>, of more than 4.9 × 10<sup>7</sup> hours, where T<sub>80</sub> is the time taken for the power conversion efficiency to decrease to 80 per cent of its initial value. This is equivalent to 27,000 years outdoors. Additionally, we subjected a second group of organic photovoltaic cells to 20 Suns of ultraviolet illumination (centred at 365 nanometres) for 848 hours, a dose that would take 1.7 × 10<sup>4</sup> hours (9.3 years) to accumulate outdoors. No efficiency loss was observed over the duration of the test.

Recent findings indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC) and noradrenergic neuromodulation may also play an important role in shaping memory development in later life. However, technical challenges in quantification of LC integrity have hindered the study of LC-cognition associations in humans. Using high-resolution, neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, we found that individual differences in learning and memory were positively associated with LC integrity across a variety of memory tasks in both younger (n = 66) and older adults (n = 228). Moreover, we observed functionally relevant age differences confined to rostral LC. Older adults with a more 'youth-like' rostral LC also showed higher memory performance. These findings link non-invasive, in vivo indices of LC integrity to memory in ageing and highlight the role of the LC norepinephrine system in the decline of cognition.</AbstractText>"}

A body of evidence suggests that both ventral hippocampus and amygdala lesions impair anxiety-like behavior, but the relative contribution of these two structures is unclear. A possible reason is that approach-avoidance conflict tasks involve a series of decisions and actions, which may be controlled by distinct neural mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle from behavioral readouts. Here, we capitalize on a human approach-avoidance conflict test, implemented as computer game, that separately measures several action components. We investigate three patients of both sexes with unspecific unilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage, one male with selective bilateral hippocampal (HC), and one female with selective bilateral amygdala lesions, and compare them to matched controls. MTL and selective HC lesions, but not selective amygdala lesions, increased approach decision when possible loss was high. In contrast, MTL and selective amygdala lesions, but not selective HC lesions, increased return latency. Additionally, selective HC and selective amygdala lesions reduced approach latency. In a task targeted at revealing subjective assumptions about the structure of the computer game, MTL and selective HC lesions impacted on reaction time generation but not on the subjective task structure. We conclude that deciding to approach reward under threat relies on hippocampus but not amygdala, whereas vigor of returning to safety depends on amygdala but not on hippocampus.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Approach-avoidance conflict tests are widely investigated in rodents, and increasingly in humans, to understand the neural basis of anxiety-like behavior. However, the contribution of the most relevant brain regions, ventral hippocampus and amygdala, is incompletely understood. We use a human computerized test that separates different action components and find that hippocampus, but not amygdala, lesions impair approach decisions, whereas amygdala, but not hippocampus, lesions impair the vigor of return to safety.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the authors.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) as a critical modulator for cancer progression. Based on RNA-sequencing data of breast invasive carcinomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we identified thymopoietin antisense transcript 1 (<i>TMPO-AS1</i>) as a functional lncRNA that significantly correlates with proliferative biomarkers. <i>TMPO-AS1</i> positivity analyzed by <i>in situ</i> hybridization significantly correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. <i>TMPO-AS1</i> expression was upregulated in endocrine therapy-resistant MCF-7 cells compared with levels in parental cells and was estrogen inducible. Gain and loss of <i>TMPO-AS1</i> experiments showed that <i>TMPO-AS1</i> promotes the proliferation and viability of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Global expression analysis using a microarray demonstrated that <i>TMPO-AS1</i> is closely associated with the estrogen signaling pathway. <i>TMPO-AS1</i> could positively regulate estrogen receptor 1 (<i>ESR1</i>) mRNA expression by stabilizing <i>ESR1</i> mRNA through interaction with <i>ESR1</i> mRNA. Enhanced expression of <i>ESR1</i> mRNA by <i>TMPO-AS1</i> could play a critical role in the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer. Our findings provide a new insight into the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying hormone-dependent breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</CopyrightInformation>"}

WMSAs are particularly evident in hypertensive older adults, suggesting vascular involvement. However, because hypertension is assessed systemically, the specific role of cerebral arterial stiffening in WMSAs has yet to be demonstrated. In 93 cognitively normal adults (aged 18-87 years), we used a novel method to measure cerebral arterial elasticity (pulse relaxation function [PReFx]) with diffuse optical tomography (pulse-DOT) and investigated its association with WMSAs, age, and cognition. PReFx was associated with WMSAs, with older adults with low PReFx showing the greatest WMSA burden. PReFx in brain regions perfused by the middle cerebral artery showed the largest associations with WMSAs and partially mediated the relationship between age and WMSAs. Finally, WMSAs partially mediated the relationship between PReFx and fluid but not crystallized abilities scores. Taken together, these findings suggest that loss of cerebral arterial elasticity is associated with cerebral white matter lesions and age-related cognitive decline.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

WMHs are also frequently observed in patients with familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, often with a particular posterior predominance. Whether amyloid and tau pathologies are linked to WMH occurrence is still debated. We examined whether cerebral amyloid and tau burden, reflected in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Aβ-42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), are related to WMH location in a cohort of 517 memory clinic patients. Two lesion mapping techniques were performed: voxel-based analyses and region of interest-based linear regression. Voxelwise associations were found between lower Aβ-42 and parieto-occipital periventricular WMHs. Regression analyses demonstrated that lower Aβ-42 correlated with larger WMH volumes in the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamic radiation, also after controlling for markers of vascular disease. P-tau was not consistently related to WMH occurrence.

The most relevant classes of contaminants were included namely metals, toxins, pesticides, dioxins and PCBs, as well as pharmacologically active ingredients. Variable amounts of contaminants were reported in a significant number of commercially available FS. Although the presence of contaminants does not necessarily mean that their levels exceed the regulatory limits or that the FS intake constitutes a risk to human health, it alerts for the need to further monitor FS safety. The evaluation of the risk associated to the consumption of FS, especially in the elderly population, is particularly challenging due to the frequent exposure to multiple toxicants and to different exposure sources, as well as due to possible pre-existing diseases and respective therapeutics. Therefore, improved quality control procedures and monitoring programs should be pursued in order to avoid undesirable products and assure the safety of FS.</AbstractText>"}

Physiological change during aging need to be clarified to better understand how university might help students. The aim of the present study was to evaluate for the first time the chronotype, the sleep quality and their relationship in senior university students and to compare them with those of undergraduate students. The <i>Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire</i> (<i>MEQ</i>) and the <i>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</i> (<i>PSQI</i>) were used. The results indicated that approximately 50% of the participants were good sleepers. This percentage was equal in the senior and undergraduate students. The results showed that undergraduate students tended toward eveningness while senior students tended toward morningness. Among the undergraduate students, evening type chronotypes had a tendency toward higher PSQI scores and this affected their daytime function scores, while it did not in the senior students, in whom worsening sleep quality was associated with disturbances such as going to the bathroom and nocturnal awakening.

ATVE can effectively alleviate hepatocyte edema, as well as inflammatory cell infiltration and injury in mice, induce a protective effect via up-regulation of glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) antioxidant related factors, and play an important role in the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10) and the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β). At the same time, HPLC analysis showed that AVTEs contain neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, rutin, isoquercitrin, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid A, astragalin, isochlorogenic acid C, rosmarinic acid, and trans-cinnamic acid. Thus, AVTE appears to be an effectively functional drink due to its rich functional components and anti-aging activities.</AbstractText>"}

This type of circuit deduces the value of the resistor based on the discharge time through it for a capacitor of a known value. Moreover, the discharge times of this capacitor should be measured through one or two resistors with known values in order to ensure that the estimate is not dependent on certain parameters that change with time, temperature, or aging. This can slow down the conversion speed, especially for high resistance values. To overcome this problem, we propose a modified process in which part of the discharge, which was previously performed through the resistive sensor only, is only conducted with the smallest calibration resistor. Two variants of this operation method, which differ in the reduction of the total time necessary for evaluation and in the uncertainty of the measurements, are presented. Experiments carried out with a field programmable gate array (FPGA); using these methodologies achieved reductions in the resistance conversion time of up to 55%. These reductions may imply an increase in the uncertainty of the measurements; however, the tests carried out show that with a suitable choice of parameters, the increases in uncertainty, and therefore errors, may be negligible compared to the direct interface circuits described in the literature.</AbstractText>"}

Since the mitochondrial genome variation can alter functional activity of cells, it is necessary to assess the presence in atherosclerotic lesions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmic mutations known to be associated with different pathological processes and ageing. In this study, mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number (mtCN) were evaluated in the autopsy-derived samples of aortic intima differing by the type of atherosclerotic lesions. To detect mtDNA heteroplasmic variants, next generation sequencing was used, and mtCN measurement was performed by qPCR. It was shown that mtDNA heteroplasmic mutations are characteristic for particular areas of intimal tissue; in 83 intimal samples 55 heteroplasmic variants were found; mean minor allele frequencies level accounted for 0.09, with 12% mean heteroplasmy level. The mtCN variance measured in adjacent areas of intima was high, but atherosclerotic lesions and unaffected intima did not differ significantly in mtCN values. Basing on the ratio of minor and major nucleotide mtDNA variants, we can conclude that there exists the increase in the number of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants, which corresponds to the extent of atherosclerotic morphologic phenotype.</AbstractText>"}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying training-induced fitness in combination with personal life-style remain largely unexplored. Circulating biomarkers such as microRNAs (miRNAs) offer themselves for studying systemic and cellular changes since they can be collected from the bloodstream in a low-invasive manner. In <i>Homo sapiens</i> miRNAs are known to regulate a substantial number of protein-coding genes in a post-transcriptional manner and hence are of great interest to understand differential gene expression profiles, offering a cost-effective mechanism to study molecular training adaption, and connecting the dots from genomics to observed phenotypes. Here, we investigated molecular expression patterns of 2549 miRNAs in whole-blood samples from 23 healthy and untrained adult participants of a cross-over study, consisting of eight weeks of endurance training, with several sessions per week, followed by 8 weeks of washout and another 8 weeks of running, using microarrays. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two study groups, one of which administered carbohydrates before each session in the first training period, and switching the treatment group for the second training period. During running sessions clinical parameters as heartbeat frequency were recorded. This information was extended with four measurements of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) for each participant. We observed that multiple circulating miRNAs show expression changes after endurance training, leveraging the capability to separate the blood samples by training status. To this end, we demonstrate that most of the variance in miRNA expression can be explained by both common and known biological and technical factors. Our findings highlight six distinct clusters of miRNAs, each exhibiting an oscillating expression profile across the four study timepoints, that can effectively be utilized to predict phenotypic VO 2 max levels. In addition, we identified miR-532-5p as a candidate marker to determine personal alterations in physical training performance on a case-by-case analysis taking the influence of a carbohydrate-rich nutrition into account. In literature, miR-532-5p is known as a common down-regulated miRNA in diabetes and obesity, possibly providing a molecular link between cellular homeostasis, personal fitness levels, and health in aging. We conclude that circulating miRNA expression can be altered due to regular endurance training, independent of the carbohydrate (CHO) availability in the training timeframe. Further validation studies are required to confirm the role of exercise-affected miRNAs and the extraordinary function of miR-532-5p in modulating the metabolic response to a high availability of glucose.</AbstractText>"}

PM can also promote premature skin aging with its accompanying functional and morphological changes. PM-induced skin diseases and premature skin aging are largely mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the harmful effects of PM may be ameliorated by safe and effective natural antioxidants. Experimental studies have shown that the extracts and phenolic compounds derived from many plants, such as cocoa, green tea, grape, pomegranate, and some marine algae, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on PM-exposed cells. The phenolic compounds can decrease the levels of ROS in cells and/or enhance cellular antioxidant capacity and, thereby, can attenuate PM-induced oxidative damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. They also lower the levels of cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, prostaglandins, and matrix metalloproteinases implicated in cellular inflammatory responses to PM. Although there is still much research to be done, current studies in this field suggest that plant-derived phenolic compounds may have a protective effect on skin exposed to high levels of air pollution.</AbstractText>"}

E","Date":"Jul 2019","Keywords":"Not avaliable","Abstract":"<AbstractText>We study normal diffusive and subdiffusive processes in a harmonic potential (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) on a uniformly growing or contracting domain. Our starting point is a recently derived fractional Fokker-Planck equation, which covers both the case of Brownian diffusion and the case of a subdiffusive continuous-time random walk (CTRW). We find a high sensitivity of the random walk properties to the details of the domain growth rate, which gives rise to a variety of regimes with extremely different behaviors. At the origin of this rich phenomenology is the fact that the walkers still move while they wait to jump, since they are dragged by the deterministic drift arising from the domain growth. Thus, the increasingly long waiting times associated with the aging of the subdiffusive CTRW imply that, in the time interval between two consecutive jumps, the walkers might travel over much longer distances than in the normal diffusive case. This gives rise to seemingly counterintuitive effects. For example, on a static domain, both Brownian diffusion and subdiffusive CTRWs yield a stationary particle distribution with finite width when a harmonic potential is at play, thus indicating a confinement of the diffusing particle. However, for a sufficiently fast growing or contracting domain, this qualitative behavior breaks down, and differences between the Brownian case and the subdiffusive case are found. In the case of Brownian particles, a sufficiently fast exponential domain growth is needed to break the confinement induced by the harmonic force; in contrast, for subdiffusive particles such a breakdown may already take place for a sufficiently fast power-law domain growth. Our analytic and numerical results for both types of diffusion are fully confirmed by random walk simulations.</AbstractText>"}

This paper builds the theoretical foundation of the process with two states: Lévy walk and Brownian motion, having been proved to be an efficient intermittent search process. The sojourn time distributions in two states are both assumed to be heavy-tailed with exponents α_{±}∈(0,2). The dynamical behaviors of this two-state process are obtained through analyzing the ensemble-averaged and time-averaged mean-squared displacements (MSDs) in weak and strong aging cases. It is discovered that the magnitude relationship of α_{±} decides the fraction of two states for long times, playing a crucial role in these MSDs. According to the generic expressions of MSDs, some inherent characteristics of the two-state process are detected. The effects of the fraction on these observables are presented in detail for six different cases. The key of getting these results is to calculate the velocity correlation function of the two-state process, the techniques of which can be generalized to other multistate processes.</AbstractText>"}

Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the long-term toxicity of DDT. However, limited information is available on its chronic toxicity to benthic invertebrates. Full-life cycle toxicity of sediment-bound DDT to Chironomus dilutus was assessed. Median lethal concentrations (with 95% confidence limits) of DDT and its degradation products (DDX) to C. dilutus were 334 (165-568), 21.4 (11.2-34.3), and 7.50 (4.61-10.6) nmol/g organic carbon after 10-, 20-, and 63-d exposure, respectively. In addition, median effect concentrations of DDX were 20.0 (15.0-25.3), 7.13 (4.10-10.5), and 8.92 (3.32-15.1) nmol/g organic carbon for growth, emergence, and reproduction, respectively. A toxicity spectrum was established to visually summarize chronic effects of DDX to midges. In addition, DDT degraded to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) during sediment aging, and their toxicity differed from that of the parent compound. Predicted toxic units of DDX in porewater were utilized to distinguish between toxicity from DDT and that of DDD and DDE. The results showed that DDD was the main contributor to the toxicity in C. dilutus. To improve the accuracy of sediment risk assessment of DDT, the composition of DDX should be considered.

The kinematics of posterior TF translation is found to occur with the increase in femoral-component flexion. The quadriceps force and patellofemoral contact force decrease with the femoral-component flexion increase. In addition, extension of the femoral component increases with the increase in posterior cruciate ligament force. The flexed femoral component in CR-TKA provides a positive biomechanical effect compared with a neutral position.

However, knowledge of the neural basis of CF is limited. This is partially because CF is difficult to systematically modulate in brain imaging experiments. The most common approach has been to scan brain activity during effortful cognitive tasks. Consequently, neural correlates of CF tend to be task-specific and may vary across tasks. This makes it difficult to know how results generalize across studies and is outside the subjective experience of CF which tends to be similar in different tasks. It has been hypothesized that the subjective experience of CF might arise from domain general systems monitoring and acting on energy depletion in task specific circuits. Direct supporting neural evidence is lacking. By repeatedly scanning aging individuals undertaking four different tasks using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and referencing scans to detailed CF self-ratings taken before and after scanning, we sought task-general correlates of CF. We ran a data-driven representational similarity analysis, treating each brain region as a candidate CF functional connectivity hub, and correlating inter-participant differences in hub-based connectivity patterns with inter-participant differences in self-rated CF-profiles (a pattern of ratings across 18 questions).

There is increasing evidence that this is due to small airway disease rather than from emphysema, especially in the early stages of the disease. Small airways (&lt;2 mm internal diameter) are narrowed in COPD with thickening and distortion of the airway wall and peribronchiolar fibrosis. In addition, loss of elasticity in alveolar attachments and mucus hypersecretion contribute to the airway narrowing and closure, leading to air trapping. The mechanisms of peribronchiolar fibrosis are poorly understood and small airway fibroblasts have not been characterised. In small airways of COPD patients the fibroblasts are profibrotic, pro-inflammatory and senescent. There is a reduction in the anti-ageing molecules sirtuin-1 and -6, which are regulated by specific microRNAs that are increased in COPD cells. It is plausible that extracellular vesicles from senescent airway epithelium transmit senescent signals to airway fibroblasts to stimulate fibrosis and inflammation. Small airways fibrosis is a target for new drug development that inhibit growth factor receptors, new antioxidants and particularly those that are targeted to mitochondria and inhibitors of cellular senescence or senolytic therapies.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

In European hares, the first stage of life until weaning and the subsequent dispersal have been sparsely studied, in particular, habitat selection, movements and survival rate, as juveniles´ precocial lifestyle is dominated by concealment, motionlessness and inconspicuousness. In this study, free-living juvenile European hares (leverets) were detected systematically by thermography (n = 394), radio-tagged or marked (n = 122) from birth until the fifth week of life to research their habitat usage and pre-dispersal movements. The day-resting places and night locations, as well as the distance moved by leverets with aging, were evaluated by generalized linear mixed effect models. In addition, the habitat preference was assessed by a conservative use-availability analysis. Up to the fifth week of life, 30.5% of all leverets used cultivated areas in the daytime. In contrast, the remaining 69.4% animals inhabitated linear or small planar structures in the daytime, with the edges of field tracks, hedges and some ruderal structures clearly being preferred. At nighttime, 93% of all juveniles, which occupied linear structures in the daytime, used the adjoining fields up to 20 m away from the next linear structure. Nocturnal distances of more than 60 m to the next edge rarely occurred before the end of the pre-weaning phase. The time of day and age have a significant influence on the distance moved by juvenile hares. With increasing age, leverets moved less during the day and roamed further at night. The results are largely consistent with the behavioral patterns found in the few previous studies on pre-weaning European hares and show the importance of hiding places for leverets in early life stages. This study should contribute to a better understanding of behavior in juvenile life-history stages of European hares that may help to identify vulnerable phases in their lifecycle. In addition, the findings can refine existing population models and improve conservation efforts.</AbstractText>"}

We constructed an observer-based scale for daily application in assessing the aging-related health and functioning of rhesus macaques. Ten items referring to an aging appearance, musculoskeletal aging and aging-related eating behavior were selected through a panel consensus. The Aging-related Health and Functioning Scale (AHFS) was constructed based on these scored items form 57 healthy rhesus macaques. High reliability of the AHFS was shown based on Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.877). The structure of the AHFS was validated by three exploratory factors. The largest factor, whose four components were dietary uptake, iliac muscle mass, hair condition and fragility, and sex, explained 50.5% of the variation in aging-related health and functioning scores. The second factor, involving age, tooth loss and tooth wear, explained 15.5% of the variation. The lowest-ranking factor comprised only facial redness and accounted for 10% of the variation. A hierarchical cluster analysis validated the good applicability of the scale in distinct samples. From these scale-scored results, complicated aging phenomena observed in humans, including the sex-survival paradox and the calorie-related health-survival paradox, were both demonstrated in rhesus macaques. Therefore, the AHFS provides a valuable approach for aging-related research.</AbstractText>"}

Polymer self-assembly is a common way to construct MGNs. However, up to now, the self-assembly strategy and the polymer category to fabricate MGNs are quite limited, and it is still a big challenge to get MGNs in a controlled way. Herein, by employing dissipative particle dynamics simulation, we provide a new 'covalent-bonding-forced orthogonal self-assembly' strategy for the preparation of MGNs through the self-assembly of block alternating copolymers. Without any additional cautious control, block alternating copolymers can directly self-assemble into various MGNs, except for two basic requirements: the critical molecular weight of each block and the incompatibility of different blocks. Any different simple geometries, like vesicles, cylinders, and spheres, can be combined at will to construct arbitrary customized MGNs by changing the blocks. We further explore the effect of polymer concentration and the volume ratio of different blocks, through which the sizes, components, and structures of the MGNs can be regulated simply. In addition, we extend this strategy to ternary systems to fabricate much more complicated nanoparticles with triple geometries. We believe the present work has provided a promising and simple strategy to efficiently construct MGNs with precisely controllable geometries.</AbstractText>"}

Deamidation and isomerization are known to be among the most prevalent chemical modifications in long-lived human proteins and are implicated in a growing list of human pathologies, but the relatively minor chemical change associated with these processes has presented a long standing analytical challenge. Although the adoption of high-resolution mass spectrometry has greatly aided the identification of deamidation sites in proteomic studies, isomerization (and the isomeric products of deamidation) remain exceptionally challenging to characterize. Herein, we present a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based approach for rapidly characterizing the isomeric products of Gln deamidation using diagnostic fragments that are abundantly produced and capable of unambiguously identifying both Glu and isoGlu. Importantly, the informative fragment ions are produced through orthogonal fragmentation pathways, thereby enabling the simultaneous detection of both isomeric forms while retaining compatibility with shotgun proteomics. Furthermore, the diagnostic fragments associated with isoGlu pinpoint the location of the modified residue. The utility of this technique is demonstrated by characterizing the isomeric products generated during <i>in vitro</i> aging of a series of glutamine-containing peptides. Sequence-dependent product profiles are obtained, and the abundance of deamidation-linked racemization is examined. Finally, comparisons are made between Gln deamidation, which is relatively poorly understood, and asparagine deamidation, which has been more thoroughly studied.</AbstractText>"}

Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been shown to govern multiple cellular events via deacetylating diverse substrates. We previously found that HDAC3 could promote meiotic apparatus assembly in mouse oocytes. In the present study, we identified a substantial reduction in HDAC3 protein in oocytes from old mice. Importantly, overexpression of HDAC3 in old oocytes not only partially prevents spindle/chromosome disorganization, but also significantly lowers the incidence of aneuploidy. Meanwhile, we noticed the elevated acetylation level of α-tubulin in oocytes derived from old mice. By employing site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that acetylation-mimetic mutant tubulin-K40Q disrupts the kinetochore-microtubule attachments and results in the assembly failure of meiotic apparatus in mouse oocytes. Importantly, forced expression of tubulin-K40R (nonacetylatable-mimetic mutant) was capable of alleviating the defective phenotypes of oocytes from aged mice. To sum up, this study uncovers that loss of HDAC3 represents one potential mechanism mediating the effects of advanced maternal age on oocyte quality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In insects, life-history traits such as longevity and fecundity are severely affected by the suppression of HAT/HDAC activity, which can be achieved by RNA-mediated gene silencing or the application of chemical inhibitors. We used both experimental approaches to investigate the effect of HAT/HDAC inhibition in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) a model insect often used to study complex life-history traits. The silencing of HAT genes (kat6b, kat7, and kat14) promoted survival or increased the number of offspring, whereas targeting rpd3 (HDAC) reduced the number of viviparous offspring but increased the number of premature nymphs, suggesting a role in embryogenesis and eclosion. Specific chemical inhibitors of HATs/HDACs showed a remarkably severe impact on life-history traits, reducing survival, delaying development, and limiting the number of offspring. The selective inhibition of HATs and HDACs also had opposing effects on aphid body weight. The suppression of HAT/HDAC activity in aphids by RNA interference or chemical inhibition revealed similarities and differences compared to the reported role of these enzymes in other insects. Our data suggest that gene expression in A. pisum is regulated by multiple HATs/HDACs, as indicated by the fitness costs triggered by inhibitors that suppress several of these enzymes simultaneously. Targeting multiple HATs or HDACs with combined effects on gene regulation could, therefore, be a promising approach to discover novel targets for the management of aphid pests.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Although most TJR recipients are elderly, studies linking wear particle-activated macrophages and peri-implant osteolysis have not taken into account the multiple effects that aging has on the innate immune system and, in particular, on macrophages. To address this, we compared the wear particle responses of bone marrow macrophages obtained from young (2-month) and aged (18-month) mice. Macrophages were polarized to M0, M1, or M2 phenotypes in vitro, challenged with titanium particles, and their inflammatory response was characterized at multiple time points by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, age-dependent changes in activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB were analyzed by a lentiviral vector-based luciferase reporter system. The particle stimulation experiment was further repeated using human primary macrophages isolated from blood donors of different ages. We found that the pro-inflammatory responses were generally higher in macrophages obtained from young mice, but differences between the age groups remained small and of uncertain biological significance. Noteworthily, M2 polarization effectively suppressed the particle-induced inflammation in both young and aged macrophages. These results suggest that aging of the innate immune system per se plays no significant role in the response of macrophages to titanium particles, whereas induction of M2 polarization appears a promising strategy to limit macrophage-mediated inflammation regardless of age.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

We retrospectively studied 320 consecutive patients with AF (median age, 91 years; range 90-100.1 years). Patients were categorized as follows: patients taking direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC group, n = 93), those taking warfarin (warfarin group, n = 147), and those not taking oral anticoagulants (non-OAC group, n = 80). During the follow-up periods (median 3.00 years; first and fourth quantiles, 1.13 and 4.56 years, respectively), in thromboembolic events, the DOAC, warfarin, and non-OAC groups showed the lowest (0%, 0/93; 0%/year), intermediate (4.7%, 7/149; 1.43%/year), and highest (5%, 4/80; 2.65%/year) incidence rates, respectively. In major bleeding events, the DOAC, warfarin, and non-OAC groups showed the highest (9.67%, 9/96; 5.00%/year), intermediate (8.1%, 12/149; 2.46%/year), and lowest (0%, 0/80; 0%/year) incidence rates, respectively. These differences in the relationships of the 3 groups were statistically significant. Confounding factors did not affect these results. Bruises associated with impairment of motor function with aging caused major bleeding in approximately 60% of major bleeding cases. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed that warfarin decreased mortality, whereas antiplatelet drugs increased mortality. In conclusion, DOACs had considerably high incidence of major bleeding events, whereas absence of OAC treatment was associated with substantially high thromboembolic events. Warfarin showed acceptable incidence ratios of both events. At present, warfarin is thus believed to be adequate for ultra-aged (≥90 years) patients with nonvalvular AF. Avoidance of bruises was important to prevent major bleeding events. Antiplatelet drugs were suggested not to be adequate for these patients.</AbstractText>"}

These studies, both on human and animal subjects, have typically focused on a single activity, usually physical exercise, but other activities have received an increasing interest. One proposed mechanism is that physical exercise increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. For the first time, the long-term effects on serum BDNF levels were compared in persons who engaged in either physical exercise training, cognitive training, or mindfulness practice during 5 weeks, and compared with an active control group. Two cohorts of healthy older individuals, one from the Boston area in the US and one from the Växjö area in Sweden, participated. A total of 146 participants were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. All interventions were structurally similar, using interactive, computer-based software that directed participants to carry out specified activities for 35 minutes/day, 5 days per week for 5 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and soon after the completion of the 5-week long intervention program, and serum BDNF levels were measured using a commercially available ELISA. Only the group that underwent cognitive training increased their serum BDNF levels after 5 weeks of training (F1,74 = 4.22, p = 0.044, partial η2 = 0.054), corresponding to an average 10% increase. These results strongly suggest that cognitive training can exert beneficial effects on brain health in an older adult population.</AbstractText>"}

We sought to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that could serve as biomarkers to differentiate NSCLC patients with and without BM. Logistic regression was conducted with 122 NSCLC patients (60 without BM, 62 with BM) to assess the association between miRNAs and BM. We confirmed several risk factors for BM and revealed that serum miR-330-3p levels are higher in NSCLC patients with BM than that without BM. Overexpression of miR-330-3p promoted proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cells <i>in vitro</i> and NSCLC tumorigenesis <i>in vivo</i>. Knocking down miR-330-3p suppressed this metastatic phenotype. We identified putative miR-330-3p target genes by comparing mRNA microarray analysis data from A549 cells after miR-330-3p knockdown with candidate miR-330-3p target genes predicted by public bioinformatic tools and luciferase reporter assays. We found that GRIA3 is a target of miR-330-3p and that miR-330-3p stimulates EMT progress by mediating GRIA3-TGF-β1 interaction. Our results provide novel insight into the role of miR-330-3p in NSCLC metastasis, and suggest miR-330-3p may be a useful biomarker for identifying NSCLC with metastatic potential.</AbstractText>"}

It has been recognized that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathology of HF. Mitokines are a type of cytokines, peptides, or signaling pathways produced or activated by the nucleus or the mitochondria through cell non-autonomous responses during cellular stress. In addition to promoting the communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus, mitokines also exert a systemic regulatory effect by circulating to distant tissues. It is noteworthy that increasing evidence has demonstrated that mitokines are capable of reducing the metabolic-related HF risk factors and are associated with HF severity. Consequently, mitokines might represent a potential therapy target for HF.</AbstractText>"}

This polimorbidity requires lifelong monitoring and specialized multidisciplinary management. In addition, the silent nature of these diseases, associated with the aging of the population and growing life expectancy, further increases the impact of this chronic disease on the overall morbidity and mortality. In Switzerland, obesity is now epidemic, as it is worldwide, and affects about 11 % of our population. This percentage is gradually increasing to the point that obesity is considered a public health problem. The direct and indirect costs of obesity account for about 8 % of total health consumption. The management of this complex disease must always be long-term and must integrate the dietary, behavioral and psychological aspects according to the profile of the patient.</AbstractText>"}

Although leisure activities may serve as a coping resource to relieve caregiving stress, only a few studies exist on how leisure and depressive symptoms associate in dementia caregivers. Moreover, less is known about the role of gender in this relationship. Thus, this study examined the relationship among leisure activity, gender and depressive symptoms. <b>Method:</b> A cutoff score (≥10) on the short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to measure presence of depressive symptoms. Independent variables were frequency of engagement in and satisfaction with leisure activities. <b>Results:</b> Logistic regression analyses from 632 dementia caregivers in the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II Study showed that more frequent and higher satisfaction in leisure engagement were negatively related to having depressive symptoms. Moreover, the negative association between frequent leisure engagement and depressive symptoms was more pronounced among male caregivers. <b>Conclusion:</b> Providing respite care for dementia caregivers to engage in leisure can be a promising coping strategy for this population. Also, gender difference in leisure-depressive symptoms relationship suggests different support needed for male and female caregivers in addition to leisure.</AbstractText>"}

However, despite evidence of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease risk, sex-stratified models have not been incorporated into previous GWAS analyses. We looked for sex-specific genetic associations with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes from six brain bank data repositories. The pooled dataset included 2701 males and 3275 females, the majority of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at autopsy (70%). Sex-stratified GWAS were performed within each dataset and then meta-analysed. Loci that reached genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) in stratified models were further assessed for sex interactions. Additional analyses were performed in independent datasets leveraging cognitive, neuroimaging and CSF endophenotypes, along with age-at-onset data. Outside of the APOE region, one locus on chromosome 7 (rs34331204) showed a sex-specific association with neurofibrillary tangles among males (P = 2.5 × 10-8) but not females (P = 0.85, sex-interaction P = 2.9 × 10-4). In follow-up analyses, rs34331204 was also associated with hippocampal volume, executive function, and age-at-onset only among males. These results implicate a novel locus that confers male-specific protection from tau pathology and highlight the value of assessing genetic associations in a sex-specific manner.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) (2019).

With data from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (1998-2007), we used Cox proportional hazards regression to separately evaluate associations of baseline PA level with mortality, dementia/cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and depressive symptoms, and we estimated the mediating effects of inflammatory markers in additive hazard models. A low level of PA (&lt;35 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week) was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 1.88), dementia/CIND (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.96), and depressive symptoms (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.52). A low PA level added 512 (95% CI: -34, 1,058) cases of dementia/CIND per 100,000 person-years at risk (direct effect), while, through a mediating path, interleukin 6 (IL-6) added another 49 (95% CI: 5, 94) cases, or 9% of the total effect. For mortality, 8%-10% of the PA total effect was mediated through IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), or TNF-α receptors. None of the inflammatory markers mediated the association between PA and depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that antiinflammation (especially as assessed by IL-6 and TNF-α levels) may partly explain how PA protects against dementia/CIND and mortality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous research has suggested that oral administration of antioxidant collagen peptides (ACPs) exerted beneficial effects on the photoaging skin structure and collagen. However, the bioactive components in ACP metabolites that are responsible for the repair effects have not been elucidated. In this study, serum containing collagen peptides (CPS) after oral administration and collagen peptides isolated from serum metabolites (SCP) were collected and their effects on cell proliferation, hyaluronic acid secretion and the collagen synthesis pathway in UVA-induced skin fibroblasts (ESF) were evaluated. Furthermore, hydroxyproline (Hyp)-containing collagen peptides from SCP were analyzed and their repair effects were examined. The repair effects of ACP metabolites in serum differed depending on the preparation method and SCP were the active components responsible for the repair effects. SCP displayed repair effects by activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway to promote procollagen synthesis and suppressing AP-1, MMP-1 and MMP-3 protein expression to prevent collagen degradation, in which SHCP exhibited the strongest bioactivity. In addition, SCP showed repair effects by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity and preserving the endogenous antioxidant defense systems. Furthermore, IO (Ile-Hyp) and AOG (Ala-Hyp-Gly) were identified as the active peptides promoting procollagen synthesis by activating the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway. These results may be useful in screening of anti-photoaging factors in metabolites and producing highly efficient collagen peptide products.</AbstractText>"}

Limitations in mobility impact ~35% of adults over 70 and the majority of adults over 85. These limitations are highly associated with disability, dependency, and survival. More than 25-years ago the term 'sarcopenia' was coined to highlight the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength with the assumption being that sarcopenia led to limitations in mobility. However, contrary to expectations, recent findings clearly indicate these variables only modestly explain limitations in mobility. One likely reason the current sarcopenia variables of muscle mass and strength do not discriminate, or predict, mobility limitations well is because they are heavily influenced by musculoskeletal mechanisms and do not incorporate measures reflective of the central neural control of mobility. Unfortunately, the precise central neural changes associated with aging that lead to decreased mobility are poorly understood. This knowledge gap has hampered the development of effective interventions for mobility limitations and the subsequent reduction of major functional disability for older adults. Here, we discuss the potential role of the motor control circuit of the dorsal basal ganglia as well as dopaminergic function in age-related reductions in mobility.</AbstractText>"}

As comorbid anxiety frequently occur in late-life depression, this study aimed to examine the association between anxiety symptoms and cognitive function among older inpatients treated for depression. We hypothesized that there would be an overall additive effect of comorbid anxiety symptoms on dysfunction across cognitive domains. The study included 142 patients treated for late-life depression in hospital, enrolled in the Prognosis of Depression in the Elderly study. Anxiety symptoms were measured at admission using the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients completed cognitive tasks at admission and discharge. Linear mixed and generalized linear mixed models were estimated to investigate the effect of anxiety, on continuous and categorical cognitive scores, respectively, while controlling for depression. Anxiety severity at admission was not associated with performance in any of the cognitive domains. Patients with more symptoms of anxiety at admission demonstrated a significant improvement in immediate recall during the hospital stay. Patients with a score above cutoff indicating clinically significant symptoms on the anxiety subscale performed better on general cognitive function, as measured by the Mini Mental Status Examination at admission, than those below cutoff for anxiety. In conclusion, comorbid anxiety symptoms had no additive effect on cognitive dysfunction in late-life depression in our sample of inpatients.</AbstractText>"}

In particular, growing evidence strongly supports the idea that the molecular interactions occurring between ER and mitochondrial membranes, referred as the mitochondria (MT)-ER contacts (MERCs), may play a crucial role in aging and in the development of age-associated diseases. As emerged in the last decade, MERCs behave as signaling hubs composed by structural components that act as critical players in different age-associated disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases and motor disorders, cancer, metabolic syndrome, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Age-associated disorders often derive from mitochondrial or ER dysfunction as consequences of oxidative stress, mitochondrial DNA mutations, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and defective organelle turnover.

The decline in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) that occurs with aging or immunodepression causes a reactivation of the latent VZV as herpes zoster (HZ). Prevention of VZV through varicella vaccination strategies allows to avoid the primary infection in newborns and susceptible subjects. Available monovalent and combined VZV vaccines are effective, safe and generally well tolerated. Universal varicella vaccination has significantly impacted on incidence, complications and deaths related to this disease. Prevention of HZ through vaccination is a priority to avoid the significant burden of its incidence and complications. Currently two HZ vaccines are available. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), approved by the FDA in 2017 and Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) licensed in the United States by the FDA in 2006. The advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) preferentially recommends RZV. ZVL remains an option for prevention of HZ in immunocompetent adults aged ≥60 years, although the CMI tends to wane a few years after vaccination.</AbstractText>"}

Reintroduction of locally extinct soil-foraging and burrowing animals has been suggested as a means to restore soil function in these ecosystems. Yet little is known about the physical and chemical effects of digging on soil over time and how these effects differ between species of digging animal, vegetation types or ecosystems. We compared foraging pits of a native reintroduced marsupial, the eastern bettong (<i>Bettongia gaimardi</i>) and that of the exotic European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>). We simulated pits of these animals and measured pit dimensions and soil chemical properties over a period of 2 years. We showed that bettong and rabbit pits differed in their morphology and longevity, and that pits had a strong moderating effect on soil surface temperatures. Over 75% of the simulated pits were still visible after 2 years, and bettong pits infilled faster than rabbit pits. Bettong pits reduced diurnal temperature range by up to 25 °C compared to the soil surface. We did not find any effects of digging on soil chemistry that were consistent across vegetation types, between bettong and rabbit pits, and with time since digging, which is contrary to studies conducted in arid biomes. Our findings show that animal foraging pits in temperate ecosystems cause physical alteration of the soil surface and microclimatic conditions rather than nutrient changes often observed in arid areas.</AbstractText>"}

As a consequence of hormonal deprivation and senescence, the anatomy and function of urogenital tissues are significantly affected and vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) may occur. In a high proportion of postmenopausal women, progressive and chronic VVA symptoms have a strong impact on sexual function and quality of life. The new definition of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) comprises genital symptoms (dryness, burning, itching, irritation, bleeding), sexual symptoms (dyspareunia and other sexual dysfunctions) and urinary symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency, recurrent urinary infections). Many variables (age, sexual activity and partnership status) influence the clinical impact VVA/GSM symptoms and attitudes of elderly women to consult for receiving effective treatments. Psychosocial factors play a critical role in sexual functioning, but the integrity of the urogenital system is as well important affecting many domains of postmenopausal women's health, including sexual function. Several international surveys have extensively documented the need to improve VVA/GSM management because of the strong impact on women's daily life and on couple's intimacy. Health care providers (HCPs) need to be proactive in the early recognition of VVA/GSM in order to preserve urogenital and sexual longevity, by using hormonal and non-hormonal strategies. The clinical diagnosis is based on genital examination to identify objective signs and on the use of subjective scales to rate most bothersome symptoms (MBS), especially vaginal dryness. Recent studies point to the importance of addressing VVA/GSM as a potential early marker of poor general health in analogy with vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, a standard of VVA/GSM care in elderly women is desirable to enhance physical, emotional and mental well-being.</AbstractText>"}

Recent attention has turned to plasma lipidomics as a means to identify potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers related to dementia, neuropsychiatric health and disease. Although several solvent-based lipid extraction protocols have been developed and are currently in use, novel and more efficient methods could greatly simplify lipid analysis in plasma and warrant investigation. Human plasma from normolipidemic adult volunteers was collected to evaluate three different solvent extraction protocols, including the classical Folch method, the methanol/tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) (Matyash) method, and a recent single-phase methanol/1-butanol (Alshehry) method. Extracted lipids were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in positive and negative ion mode. Overall, more than 500 different lipids were identified in positive and negative ion mode combined. Our data show that the single phase Alshehry method was as effective as the Folch and Matyash methods in extracting most lipid classes and was more effective in extraction of polar lipids. Normalized peak areas of the Alshehry method were highly and positively correlated with both the Folch and Matyash methods (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.99 and 0.97, respectively).

In this study, we investigated the ischemic penumbra's capacity to respond to somatosensory input. We examined adult (3- to 4-month-old) and old (18- to 24-month-old) male mice at 2-4 h after MCAO, using two-photon microscopy to record somatosensory stimulation-induced neuronal and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the ischemic penumbra. In both adult and old mice, MCAO abolished spontaneous and stimulation-induced electrical activity in the penumbra, and strongly reduced stimulation-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in neuronal somas (35-82%) and neuropil (92-100%) in the penumbra. In comparison, after stroke, stimulation-induced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the penumbra were only moderately reduced (by 54-62%) in adult mice, and were even better preserved (reduced by 31-38%) in old mice. Our results suggest that somatosensory stimulation evokes astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the ischemic penumbra. We hypothesize that the relatively preserved excitability of astrocytes, most prominent in aged mice, may modulate protection from ischemic infarcts during early somatosensory activation of an ischemic cortical area.

It could be assumed that when presbycusis is accompanied by tinnitus, general hearing functions, and particularly comprehension of speech in quiet and speech in noise (SIN), will be significantly affected. In this study, speech comprehension ability and other parameters of auditory function were assessed in elderly subjects with (T, <i>n</i> = 25) and without (NT, <i>n</i> = 26) tinnitus, aiming for examination of both peripheral and central auditory processing. Apart from high-frequency audiograms in quiet and in background noise, speech recognition thresholds in silence or in competitive babble noise, and the ability to understand temporally gated speech (GS), we measured also sensitivity to frequency modulation (FM) and interaural delay, gap detection thresholds (GDT), or the difference limens of intensity. The results show that in elderly participants matched by age (mean ages around 68 years), cognitive status (median MoCA scores around 27), and hearing thresholds [median pure-tone averages (PTA) around 16 dB hearing loss (HL)], tinnitus <i>per se</i> has little influence on speech comprehension. The tinnitus patients also show similar GDT, sensitivity to interaural intensity difference, and sensitivity to FM as the NT subjects. Despite these similarities, nevertheless, significant differences in auditory processing have been found in the tinnitus participants: a worse ability to detect tones in noise, a higher sensitivity to intensity changes, and a higher sensitivity to interaural time differences. Additional correlation analyses further revealed that speech comprehension in the T subjects is dependent on the sensitivity to temporal modulation and interaural time delay (ITD), while these correlations are weak and non-significant in the NT subjects. Therefore, despite similarities in average speech comprehension and several other parameters of auditory function, elderly people with tinnitus exhibit different auditory processing, particularly at a suprathreshold level. The results also suggest that speech comprehension ability of elderly tinnitus patients relies more on temporal features of the sound stimuli, especially under difficult conditions, compared to elderly people without tinnitus.</AbstractText>"}

The adipokine lipocalin 2 (LCN2) has been implicated in inflammation and obesity. Herein, we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction (CR) on LCN2-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress in the BAT of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mice were fed a HFD for 20 weeks and then either continued on the HFD or subjected to CR for the next 12 weeks. CR led to the browning of the white fat-like phenotype in HFD-fed mice. Increased expressions of LCN2 and its receptor in the BAT of HFD-fed mice were significantly attenuated by CR. Additionally, HFD+CR-fed mice had fewer neutrophils and macrophages expressing LCN2 and iron-positive cells than HFD-fed mice. Further, oxidative stress and mitochondrial fission induced by a HFD were also significantly attenuated by CR. Our findings indicate that the protective effects of CR on inflammation and oxidative stress in the BAT of obese mice may be associated with regulation of LCN2.</AbstractText>"}

Anecdotal evidence suggests that ethnic minorities, in particular aged members of South Asian ethnic minorities, face significant and diverse obstacles in accessing services important to their general welfare. This study is the first systematic attempt to explore the long-term care needs of Nepalese older adults in Hong Kong and the barriers they face in accessing long-term care services. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 30 Nepalese older adults. We found that Nepalese older adults have similar physical and psychosocial needs as those of their local Chinese counterparts. However, participants face a range of structural, knowledge, and attitudinal barriers that together deter them from accessing long-term care services, despite their right to do so. Policy recommendations to mitigate these barriers are given, with reference to the World Health Organization's Age-Friendly Cities Framework.</AbstractText>"}

The analytic sample featured 5,600 Chinese adults aged 60 or older. The study conceptualized two sets of models: social cohesion as mediators and as moderators in the relationship of living arrangements and quality of life. <b>Results:</b> Results from structural equation modelling analyses show that Chinese older adults who lived with adult children had lower quality of life scores compared with those who did not live with adult children; the negative relationship was partially mediated through decreased social cohesion. The study also found social cohesion may buffer the negative influence of not living with a spouse compared with those who did. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study sheds light on the mediating and moderating effects of social cohesion on the relationship between living arrangement and quality of life among older adults in China.

When patients become incapacitated, 'surrogates' often collaborate with physicians on POST decisions. Surrogates may vary in their willingness to collaborate, which can be problematic when physicians expect shared decision-making. No research has yet investigated collaborative decision-making among surrogates on the POST. This study investigated how six psychological variables predicted participants' desires for collaboration when completing an online decision-making task. <b>Methods:</b> Participants served as hypothetical surrogates and made decisions for another person on the three sections of the West Virginia POST. One-hundred-and-seventy-two adults were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. <b>Results:</b> The six variables contributed significantly to the prediction of collaborative willingness, <i>F</i> (6, 163) = 5.29, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>=</i> 0.19.

Poverty was measured according to the latest national poverty line settled at an annual per-capita income of 2300 yuan (approximately equivalent to 1.25 dollar/day) in 2011 in China. A marginal structural model was utilized to explore the association between poverty and the risk of incident cognitive impairment. The subgroup analyses were also conducted in this study. <b>Results</b>: The cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment over 6 years was 30.69% (1936/6309). Poverty increased 34% risk of incident cognitive impairment in the elderly (odds ratio = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.56) after controlling behavioral factors and health status covariates.

This enthusiasm concerns also older patients in view of the good tolerance of immunotherapy in young people. However, advanced age is linked to changes in the immune system, called immunosenescence, which could have a negative impact on the efficacy and toxicity of immunotherapy treatment. Knowledge in terms of efficacy and tolerance is limited for geriatric patients, few being included in clinical studies. This article summarizes the experience of immunotherapy in large clinical trials. It appears that the immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective and well tolerated in the elderly.</AbstractText>"}

Lower blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in response to exercise and other stressors are prevalent in Ds, and are mediated by autonomic dysfunction. The Ts65Dn mouse is a model of Ds that is commonly used in preclinical studies, but has not been formally investigated for cardiovascular responses in conscious mice. Based on human studies of Ds, we hypothesized Ts65Dn would have lower BP and HR, but similar arterial stiffness. BP was quantified in conscious wild-type (WT) and Ts65Dn. A main effect for strain was observed for all BP measures (systolic, diastolic, mean, pulse pressure), with WT higher than Ts65Dn. Pulse wave velocity was similar between WT and Ts65Dn. High-frequency power spectra was higher in WT suggesting autonomic differences between strains. Freely moving HR was higher in WT versus Ts65Dn in both the dark and light cycles, although a main effect of circadian cycle was also present (dark&gt; light). Similar to what is observed in humans, Ts65Dn has a lower BP which may be attributed to autonomic differences and result in preservation of arterial function with advancing age. Ts65Dn thus appears to capture the Ds cardiovascular phenotype across the lifespan. These data support further use of Ts65Dn to investigate mechanisms that may lead to altered BP and HR responses in Ds.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

The intravesicular domain, called ISVAID, contains the BACE1 cleavage site of APP. We have tested the functional significance of BACE1 processing of APP using App-Swedish (App<sup>s</sup> ) knock-in rats, which carry an App mutation that causes familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) in humans. We show that in App<sup>s</sup> rats, β-cleavage of APP is favored over α-cleavage. App<sup>s</sup> rats show facilitated glutamate, but not GABA, release. Our data support the notion that APP tunes glutamate release, and that BACE1 cleavage of the ISVAID segment of APP facilitates this function. We define this phenomenon as BACE1 on APP-dependent glutamate release (BAD-Glu). Unsurprisingly, App<sup>s</sup> rats show no evidence of AD-related pathology at 15 days and 3 months of age, indicating that alterations in BAD-Glu are not caused by pathological lesions. The evidence that a pathogenic APP mutation causes an early enhancement of BAD-Glu suggests that alterations of BACE1 processing of APP in glutamatergic synaptic vesicles could contribute to dementia.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

However, the function of CBX8 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. Our study was designed to explore the biological function and clinical implication of CBX8 in HCC. We investigated the interplay between CBX8 and cell cycle through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and western blotting. Bioinformatics tools and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore cell cycle regulation. Finally, we studied the expression and clinical significance of CBX8 in HCC through 3 independent datasets. CBX8 was upregulated in HCC and its expression correlated with cell cycle progression. CyclinD1 was downregulated by CBX8 knockdown but upregulated by CBX8 overexpression. YBX1 interacted with CBX8 and regulated the cell cycle. Moreover, targeting YBX1 with specific siRNA impaired CBX8-mediated regulation of CyclinD1. CBX8 overexpression boosted HCC cell growth, while CBX8 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation. Further, YBX1 interacted with CBX8. YBX1 knockdown compromised the proliferation of CBX8 overexpressing cells. CBX8 promotes HCC cell proliferation through YBX1 mediated cell cycle progression and is related to poor HCC prognoses. Therefore, CBX8 may serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.</AbstractText>"}

As a significant means to regulate gene expression, epigenetic regulation of angiogenesis in SCI is still largely unknown. Here, we found that Ubiquitously Transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on chromosome X (UTX), the histone H3K27 demethylase, increased significantly in endothelial cells post SCI. Knockdown of UTX can promote the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. The specific knockout of UTX in endothelial cells enhanced angiogenesis post SCI accompanied with improved neurological function. In addition, we found regulation of UTX expression can change the level of microRNA 24 (miR-24) in vitro. The physical binding of UTX to the promotor of miR-24 was indicated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Meanwhile, methylation sequencing of endothelial cells demonstrated that UTX could significantly decrease the level of methylation in the miR-24 promotor. Furthermore, miR-24 significantly abolished the promoting effect of UTX deletion on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we predicted the potential target mRNAs of miR-24 related to angiogenesis. We indicate that UTX deletion can epigenetically promote the vascular regeneration and functional recovery post SCI by forming a regulatory network with miR-24.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The pathophysiological understanding of and therapeutic resources for these neuropsychiatric disorders are still limited. Humans harbor over 1000 unique bacterial species in our gut, which have been linked to both physical and mental/cognitive health. The gut microbiome is a novel and promising avenue to understand the attributes of psychiatric diseases and, potentially, to modify them. Building upon our previous work, this systematic review evaluates the most recent evidence of the gut microbiome in clinical populations with serious mental illness (SMI). Sixteen articles that met our selection criteria were reviewed, including cross-sectional cohort studies and longitudinal treatment trials. All studies reported alterations in the gut microbiome of patients with SMI compared to non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs), and beta-diversity was consistently reported to be different between schizophrenia and NCs. Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium were relatively decreased in BD, and abundance of Ruminococcaceae was reported across several investigations of SMI to be associated with better clinical characteristics. Lactic acid bacteria were relatively more abundant in SMI and associated with worse clinical outcomes. There was very limited evidence for the efficacy of probiotic or prebiotic interventions in SMI. As microbiome research in psychiatry is still nascent, the extant literature has several limitations. We critically evaluate the current data, including experimental approaches. There is a need for more unified methodological standards in order to arrive at robust biological understanding of microbial contributions to SMI.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed chromosome architecture during nematode X chromosome dosage compensation, which represses transcription via a dosage-compensation condensin complex (DCC) that binds hermaphrodite Xs and establishes megabase-sized topologically associating domains (TADs). We show that DCC binding at high-occupancy sites (rex sites) defines eight TAD boundaries. Single rex deletions disrupted boundaries, and single insertions created new boundaries, demonstrating that a rex site is necessary and sufficient to define DCC-dependent boundary locations. Deleting eight rex sites (8rexΔ) recapitulated TAD structure of DCC mutants, permitting analysis when chromosome-wide domain architecture was disrupted but most DCC binding remained. 8rexΔ animals exhibited no changes in X expression and lacked dosage-compensation mutant phenotypes. Hence, TAD boundaries are neither the cause nor the consequence of DCC-mediated gene repression. Abrogating TAD structure did, however, reduce thermotolerance, accelerate aging, and shorten lifespan, implicating chromosome architecture in stress responses and aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using passive microrheology via videomicroscopy, mean square displacements of tracer particles suspended in fibrin at different ageing times are obtained. The anomalous diffusion is then described by a damped white noise process with memory, with analytical results closely matching experimental plots of mean square displacements and probability density function. We further show that the white noise functional stochastic approach applied to passive microrheology reveals the existence of a gelation parameter μ which elucidates the dynamics of constrained tracer particles embedded in a time-dependent soft material. In addition, we found that microstructural heterogeneity of particle environments decreases as the ageing time increases.

In the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, inhibiting neutrophil adhesion using an antibody against the neutrophil specific protein Ly6G was recently shown to drive rapid improvements in cerebral blood flow that was accompanied by an improvement in performance on short-term memory tasks. Here, in a longitudinal aging study, we assessed how far into disease development a single injection of anti-Ly6G treatment can acutely improve short-term memory function. We found that APP/PS1 mice as old as 15-16 months had improved performance on the object replacement and Y-maze tests of spatial and working short-term memory, measured at one day after anti-Ly6G treatment. APP/PS1 mice at 17-18 months of age or older did not show acute improvements in cognitive performance, although we did find that capillary stalls were still reduced and cerebral blood flow was still increased by 17% in 21-22-months-old APP/PS1 mice given anti-Ly6G antibody. These data add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that cerebral blood flow reductions are an important contributing factor to the cognitive dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease. Thus, interfering with neutrophil adhesion could be a new therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>"}

Although nonadherence to treatment contributes to uncontrolled hypertension, it is likely that not all the pathophysiological mechanisms are neutralized by the various classes of antihypertensive treatment currently available, and, the counter-regulatory mechanisms triggered by these treatments may decrease their blood pressure-lowering effect. The development of new antihypertensive drugs acting on new targets, with different modes of action, therefore, remains essential, to improve blood pressure control and reduce the residual burden of cardiovascular risks further. However, the difficulties encountered in the conception, development, costs, and delivery to the market of new classes of antihypertensive agents highlights the hurdles that must be overcome to release and to evaluate their long-term safety and efficacy for hypertension only, especially because of the market pressure of cheap generic drugs. New chemical entities with blood pressure-lowering efficacy are thus being developed more for heart failure or diabetic kidney disease, 2 diseases pathophysiologically associated with hypertension. These include dual angiotensin II receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, nonsteroidal dihydropyridine-based mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, as well as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. However, centrally acting aminopeptidase A inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists have a dedicated program of development for hypertension. All these emergent drug classes and their potential use in hypertension are reviewed here.</AbstractText>"}

Ageing evokes a number of functional, pharmacological and morphological changes in the vasculature, accompanied by a progressive failure of protective and homeostatic mechanisms, resulting in target organ damage. Impaired vasomotor, proliferation, migration, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory function in both the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells are parts of the vascular ageing phenotype. The endothelium regulates these functions by the release of a wide variety of active molecules including endothelium-derived relaxing factors such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub> ) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH). During ageing, a functional decay of the nitric oxide pathway takes place. Nitric oxide signals to VSMC and other important cell types for vascular homeostasis through the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Maintenance of proper cGMP levels is an important goal in sustainment of proper vascular function during ageing. For this purpose, different components can be targeted in this signalling system, and among them, phosphodiesterase-1 (PDE1) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) are crucial. This review focuses on the role of PDE1 and sGC in conditions that are relevant for vascular ageing.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).</CopyrightInformation>"}

Because eggs and sperm are under disruptive selection, sperm are predicted to be particularly vulnerable to the genetic load generated by maternal inheritance, yet evidence for mitochondrial involvement in male fertility is limited and controversial. Here, we exploit the coexistence of two divergent mitochondrial haplogroups (A and B2) in a Neotropical arachnid to investigate the role of mitochondria in sperm competition. DNA profiling demonstrated that B2-carrying males sired more than three times as many offspring in sperm competition experiments than A males, and this B2 competitive advantage cannot be explained by female mitochondrial haplogroup or male nuclear genetic background. RNA-Seq of testicular tissues implicates differential expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes in the B2 competitive advantage, including a 22-fold upregulation of atp8 in B2 males. Previous comparative genomic analyses have revealed functionally significant amino acid substitutions in differentially expressed genes, indicating that the mitochondrial haplogroups differ not only in expression but also in DNA sequence and protein functioning. However, mitochondrial haplogroup had no effect on sperm number or sperm viability, and, when females were mated to a single male, neither male haplogroup, female haplogroup nor the interaction between male/female haplogroup significantly affected female reproductive success. Our findings therefore suggest that mitochondrial effects on male reproduction may often go undetected in noncompetitive contexts and may prove more important in nature than is currently appreciated.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Less attention has been paid to the aging-related decline of inhibitory function, which reduces the ability to suppress distraction from irrelevant sensory input. In a response suppression paradigm, young and older adults listened to sequences of three short sounds during MEG recording. The amplitudes of the cortical P30 response and the 40-Hz transient gamma response were compared with age, hearing loss and SIN performance. Sensory gating, indicated by the P30 amplitude ratio between the last and the first responses, was reduced in older compared to young listeners. Sensory gating was correlated with age in the older adults but not with hearing loss nor with SIN understanding. The transient gamma response expressed less response suppression. However, the gamma amplitude increased with age and SIN loss. Comparisons of linear multi-variable modeling showed a stronger brain-behavior relationship between the gamma amplitude and SIN performance than between gamma and age or hearing loss. The findings support the hypothesis that aging-related changes in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neural mechanisms modify the generation of gamma oscillations, which impacts on perceptual binding and consequently on SIN understanding abilities. In conclusion, SIN recognition in older age is less affected by central auditory processing at the level of sensation, indicated by sensory gating, but is strongly affected at the level of perceptual organization, indicated by the correlation with the gamma responses.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The Labrador retriever (LR) is one of the most popular dog breeds. The aim of this study was to quantify LR breed health in comparison with mixed-breed dogs (MB), by using four different data sources: a veterinary practice management system (appr. 35,000 unique individuals LR + MB), data from two animal insurance companies (appr. 15,500 and 4500 individuals respectively), and a histopathological laboratory (appr. 4000 individuals). After extensive recoding of the data, health parameters utilised to quantify breed health were longevity, frequency of practice visits and insurance expense claims, and diagnostic codes. A Kaplan-Meier univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard model were used to evaluate longevity. A negative binomial model was used to analyse the frequency of visits, claims, and diagnostic codes in both sets of insurance data. Logistic regression was used to look into the categorical diagnostic codes in the laboratory data. The median lifespan of the LR was similar (12 years, practice data) or longer (10 versus 8 years, insurance data) than MB for individuals with a known birth and death date. When including censored individuals, survival time in the LR was comparable to MB individuals up to 10 years of age. Above 10 years of age, the LR lived a similar length as MB with a medium to large body size, but shorter than all MB. The LR visited the veterinary practice more often (risk ratio (RR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-1.3), and also showed a higher frequency of insurance expense claims (RR 2.2 (2.1-2.3) and RR 1.2 (1.1-1.3) respectively for the two insurance data sets). The largest difference in organ systems between the LR and MB in insurance claims was related to ears (RR 5.3 (4.8-5.8) and RR 2.6 (2.3-3.1)), followed by airways (RR 2.6 (2.4-2.8)), tendons &amp; muscles (RR 2.4 (2.2-2.6) and RR 1.4 (1.1-1.7)), and joints (RR 1.7 (1.3-2.1)), without a difference in median age at diagnosis. The data from the histopathological laboratory suggested a higher disease burden related to oncology for the LR compared to MB (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.3). Oncological diagnoses were made at a younger age in the LR (8.8 versus 9.4 years). The disease burden was significantly higher for the LR than MB, but these results may suffer from substantial bias such as selection bias towards the database, and different behaviour of LR versus MB owners with regards to veterinary care. In the future, longer term population data can corroborate these results.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation>"}

The formation of vAPs correlated significantly with the decrease in the content of monomeric anthocyanins and pyruvic acid during 12 months of aging. vAPs were more stable than their corresponding monomeric anthocyanins. Methylation in the B-ring and glycosylation with galactose and arabinose further improved the stability of vAPs. Aging for 12 months led to depletion of pyruvic acid and reduction of over 50% of monomeric anthocyanins. The content of vAPs increased by 26-54% during the first six months of aging, followed by a 2.2-10.2% reduction over the following six months. More residual pyruvic acid in S. pombe wines after fermentation consequently enhanced the generation of vAPs during aging.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to identify potential biological pathways linking loneliness with morbidity and mortality by examining associations of loneliness with biomarkers. Participants in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 3239) aged 50 years or older with an average age of 64 years, provided data in waves 4 (2008/2009) and 6 (2012/2013). Linear regression conditional change models had three outcomes: C reactive protein (CRP) measured in mg/L (log transformed), fibrinogen in g/L and ferritin in g/dL. In men, the onset of loneliness indicated by answering 'no' at wave 4 and 'yes' at wave 6 to question 'Much of the time during the past week, you felt lonely?' was associated with a statistically significant increase in levels of CRP (β = 0.36, 95% confidence interval (0.09 to 0.62)), plasma fibrinogen (0.18 (0.04 to 0.31)) and ferritin (41.04 (6.58 to 75.50)), after full adjustment. A statistically significant increase in CRP in men was also observed for onset of loneliness assessed with the question 'How often do you feel lonely?' (0.20 (0.03 to 0.38)). These associations were not mediated by depressive symptoms. Persistent loneliness (loneliness experienced at both baseline and follow-up) assessed using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness scale was associated with an increase in CRP (0.11 (0.004 to 0.22)) among men. Associations of the two latter loneliness measures with fibrinogen and ferritin were mainly null. Among women, the only statistically significant association was for persistent loneliness (loneliness at both waves) identified by question 'Much of the time during the past week, you felt lonely?' with a reduction in levels of ferritin (-20.62 (-39.78 to -1.46)). Men may be more susceptible to loneliness-associated disease risks signaled by biological changes, including systemic inflammation. Combined social and targeted medical interventions may help to reduce health risks associated with loneliness.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

FOG impairs motor function, causes falls and leads to loss of independence. Whereas dual tasking that distracts patients' attention precipitates FOG, auditory or visual cues ameliorate this phenomenon. The pathophysiology of FOG remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the basal ganglia are involved in the generation of FOG. Investigation of the modulation of neuronal activities within basal ganglia structures during walking is warranted. To this end, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) while PD patients performed single-task gait (ST) or walked while dual-tasking (DT). An index of FOG (iFOG) derived from trunk accelerometry was used as an objective measure to differentiate FOG-vulnerable gait from normal gait. Two spectral activities recorded from the STN region were associated with vulnerability to freezing. Greater LFP power in the low beta (15-21 Hz) and theta (5-8 Hz) bands were noted during periods of vulnerable gait in both ST and DT states. Whereas the elevation of low beta activities was distributed across STN, the increase in theta activity was focal and found in ventral STN and/or substantia nigra (SNr) in ST. The results demonstrate that low beta and theta band oscillations within the STN area occur during gait susceptible to freezing in PD. They also add to the evidence that narrow band ~18 Hz activity may be linked to FOG.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this review, we provide an overview of the cognitive consequences of type 1 and type 2 diabetes based on hallmark studies that follow patients over an extended period of time. In patients with type 1 diabetes, cognitive dysfunction appears soon after diagnosis and can be found in individuals of any age. The magnitude of these effects is generally modest, although their severity is especially pronounced in those with early onset type 1 diabetes (diagnosis before 7 years of age) or those who have developed microvascular disease, such as proliferative retinopathy. Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased dramatically over the past 20 years, in part driven by the world-wide epidemic of obesity, and this form of diabetes is appearing at a progressively younger age. Again, cognition may be disrupted, particularly in those who are in poorer glycemic control, and there is some evidence to suggest that with increasing diabetes duration, the rate of cognitive decline is accelerated and the risk of dementia is increased significantly.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Administration of sufficient donor HSCs is critical to restore recipient hematopoiesis and to maintain long-term polyclonal blood formation. However, due to lack of unique markers, the frequency of HSCs among UCB CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is the subject of ongoing debate, urging for reproducible strategies for their counting. Here, we used cellular barcoding to determine the frequency and clonal dynamics of human UCB HSCs and to determine how data analysis methods affect these parameters. We transplanted lentivirally barcoded CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from 20 UCB donors into Nod/Scid/IL2Ry<sup>-/-</sup> (NSG) mice (n = 30). Twelve recipients (of 8 UCB donors) engrafted with &gt;1% GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, allowing for clonal analysis by multiplexed barcode deep sequencing. Using multiple definitions of clonal diversity and strategies for data filtering, we demonstrate that differences in data analysis can change clonal counts by several orders of magnitude and propose methods to improve their consistency. Using these methods, we show that the frequency of NSG-repopulating cells was low (median ∼1 HSC/10<sup>4</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> UCB cells) and could vary up to 10-fold between donors. Clonal patterns in blood became increasingly consistent over time, likely reflecting initial output of transient progenitors, followed by long-term HSCs with stable hierarchies. The majority of long-term clones displayed multilineage output, yet clones with lymphoid- or myeloid-biased output were also observed. Altogether, this study uncovers substantial interdonor and analysis-induced variability in the frequency of UCB CD34<sup>+</sup> clones that contribute to post-transplant hematopoiesis. As clone tracing is increasingly relevant, we urge for universal and transparent methods to count HSC clones during normal aging and upon transplantation.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

The leakage of BBB contributes to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and harmful mediators into brain parenchyma, even the drugs that can not cross BBB under physiological conditions. Therefore, PD has been regarded as not only a neurodegenerative disease, but also a systemic disorder. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Dexrazoxane (Dex), a drug clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy, can enter into midbrain and striatum through broken BBB in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rodent models of PD. Unexpectedly, Dex (1.5, 5, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 3-week significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-treated rats and Dex (10 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment for 5-week improves MPTP-induced mouse motor dysfunctions. We find that Dex administration protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin-induced degeneration in SNc, accompanied by the attenuated glial cell activation. Further study indicates that suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as the inhibition of systemic inflammation in both peripheral tissues and brain, contribute to the neuroprotective effects of Dex in PD models. Our study implies that Dex may serve as an effective neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration and has potential clinical value in term of PD therapeutics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Western medicines for dementia symptoms are widely used in China, but many patients choose Chinese medicines even though they have little evidence supporting efficacy. The number of clinical trials of Chinese and western medicines has substantially increased as a result of progress in research on new antidementia drugs but international multicentre studies are few in number.

Here we show that during induction of DNA damage-induced senescence in human non-cancerous cells, PML accumulates at the nucleolar periphery simultaneously with inactivation of RNA polymerase I (RNAP I) and nucleolar segregation. Using time-lapse and high-resolution microscopy, we followed the genesis, structural transitions and destiny of PNAs to show that: 1) the dynamic structural changes of the PML-nucleolar interaction are tightly associated with inactivation and reactivation of RNAP I-mediated transcription, respectively; 2) the PML-nucleolar compartment develops sequentially under stress and, upon stress termination, it culminates in either of two fates: disappearance or persistence; 3) all PNAs stages can associate with DNA damage markers; 4) the persistent, commonly long-lasting PML multi-protein nucleolar structures (PML-NDS) associate with markers of DNA damage, indicating a role of PNAs in persistent DNA damage response characteristic for senescent cells. Given the emerging evidence implicating PML in homologous recombination-directed DNA repair, we propose that PNAs contribute to sequestration and faithful repair of the highly unstable ribosomal DNA repeats, a fundamental process to maintain a precise balance between DNA repair mechanisms, with implications for genomic integrity and aging.</AbstractText>"}

When designing viscoelastic materials to mimic the mechanical properties of native tissue niches, it is important to consider the timescales over which cells probe their microenvironment, as the response of a viscoelastic material to an imposed stress or strain is timescale dependent. Although the timescale of cellular mechano-sensing is currently unknown, hydrogel substrates with tunable viscoelastic spectra can allow one to probe the cellular response to timescale dependent mechanical properties. Here, we report on a cytocompatible and viscoelastic hydrogel culture system with reversible boronate ester cross-links, formed from pendant boronic acid and vicinal diol moieties, where the equilibrium kinetics of esterification were leveraged to tune the viscoelastic spectrum. We found that viscoelasticity increased as a function of the boronic acid and vicinal diol concentration, and also increased with decreasing cross-linker concentration, where the maximal loss tangent achieved with this system was 0.55 at 0.1 rad s<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, we found that the cis-vicinal diols configuration altered the viscoelastic spectra, where a tan δ peak occurred at ~1 rad s<sup>-1</sup> for hydrogels functionalized with boronic acid, while an additional peak formed at ≥10 rad s<sup>-1</sup> for hydrogels functionalized with both boronic acid and cis-vic-diols. In experiments with NIH-3T3 fibroblasts cultured on these hydrogels, the projected cell area and nuclear area, focal adhesion tension, and subcellular localization of YAP/TAZ were all found to be lower for cells cultured on the viscoelastic hydrogels compared to elastic hydrogels with a similar storage modulus. Despite these differences, there was not a statistically significant relationship between the frequency dependent viscoelastic material properties characterized in this study and cellular morphologies, focal adhesion tension, or the subcellular localization of YAP. While these results demonstrate that mechanotransduction pathways are affected by viscoelasticity, they also suggest that these mechanotransduction pathways are not particularly sensitive to the frequency dependent viscoelastic material properties from 0.1 to 10 rad s<sup>-1</sup>.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Typical alterations in aging skin involve a reduction of the dermis thickness, a significant expansion of the dermal white adipose tissue as well as modifications of the content and distribution of hyaluronan, impairment of autophagic flux, a reduction of collagen expression and an increase in tissue inflammation. All of these phenomena can be connected with changes in Cav-1 expression in the aging skin.

As a signal integrator, mTOR shows a complex dynamical behavior which determines the cell fate at different cellular processes levels, including cell cycle progression, cell survival, cell death, metabolic reprogramming, and aging. The dynamics of the complex responses to rapamycin in cancer cells have been attributed to its differential time-dependent inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2, the two main complexes of mTOR. Two explanations were previously provided for this phenomenon: 1-Rapamycin does not inhibit mTORC2 directly, whereas it prevents mTORC2 formation by sequestering free mTOR protein (Le Chatelier's principle). 2-Components like Phosphatidic Acid (PA) further stabilize mTORC2 compared with mTORC1. To understand the mechanism by which rapamycin differentially inhibits the mTOR complexes in the cancer cells, we present a mathematical model of rapamycin mode of action based on the first explanation, i.e., Le Chatelier's principle. Translating the interactions among components of mTORC1 and mTORC2 into a mathematical model revealed the dynamics of rapamycin action in different doses and time-intervals of rapamycin treatment. This model shows that rapamycin has stronger effects on mTORC1 compared with mTORC2, simply due to its direct interaction with free mTOR and mTORC1, but not mTORC2, without the need to consider other components that might further stabilize mTORC2. Based on our results, even when mTORC2 is less stable compared with mTORC1, it can be less inhibited by rapamycin.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Elastic fibers are produced only during development and childhood, before being progressively degraded by mechanical stress and enzymatic activities during adulthood and aging. During this period, arterial elastic fiber calcification and loading of lipids also occur, all of these events conducting to arteriosclerosis. This leads to a progressive dysfunction of the large elastic arteries inducing elevated blood pressure as well as altered hemodynamics and organ perfusion, which induce more global malfunctions of the body during normal aging. Additionally, some arterial conditions occur more frequently with advancing age, such as atherosclerosis or aneurysms, which are called age-related diseases or pathological aging. The physiological or pathological degradation of elastic fibers and function of elastic arteries seemed to be rather inevitable over time. However, during the recent years, different molecules - including several ATP-dependent potassium channel openers, such as minoxidil - have been shown to re-induce elastin production and elastic fiber assembly, leading to improvements in the arterial structure and function or in organ perfusion. This review summarizes the changes in the arterial elastic fibers and structure from development until aging, and presents some of the potential pharmacotherapies leading to elastic fiber neosynthesis and arterial function improvement.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It was recently shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes can compensate for a lack of glucose by utilizing fatty acid oxidation. Given that mitochondrial function decreases with age, we hypothesized that classical monocytes taken from aged individuals would have an impaired ability to upregulate oxidative metabolism along with impaired effector functions. Aging did not impair LPS-induced oxygen consumption rate during glucose deprivation as measured on a Seahorse XFp system.

Based on the current literature, there are some molecular differences related to blood brain barrier (BBB) homeostasis disruption, inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated injury between the immature and mature brain after an ischemic event. In particular, astrocytes, the main glial cells in brain, play a different role in neonatal and adult brain after stroke, as time course of glial activation is strongly age dependent. Moreover, the present review provides further insight into the therapeutic approaches of using neonatal and adult astrocytes after stroke. More research will be needed in order to translate them into an effective treatment against stroke, the second main cause of death and disability worldwide.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Accumulating evidence demonstrated blood-spinal-cord barrier (BSCB) impairment mainly via endothelial cell (EC) degeneration in ALS patients and animal models. BSCB repair may be a therapeutic approach for ALS. We showed benefits of human bone marrow endothelial progenitor cell (hBMEPC) transplantation into symptomatic ALS mice on barrier restoration; however, cellular mechanisms remain unclear. The study aimed to characterize hBMEPCs in vitro under normogenic conditions. hBMEPCs were cultured at different time points. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concentrations of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A, angiogenin-1, and endoglin) and angiogenic inhibitor endostatin in conditioned media. Double immunocytochemical staining for CD105, ZO-1, and occludin with F-actin was performed. Results showed predominantly gradual significant post-culture increases of VEGF-A and angiogenin-1 levels. Cultured cells displayed distinct rounded or elongated cellular morphologies and positively immunoexpressed for CD105, indicating EC phenotype. Cytoskeletal F-actin filaments were re-arranged according to cell morphologies. Immunopositive expressions for ZO-1 were detected near inner cell membrane and for occludin on cell membrane surface of adjacent hBMEPCs. Together, secretion of angiogenic factors by cultured cells provides evidence for a potential mechanism underlying endogenous EC repair in ALS through hBMEPC transplantation, leading to restored barrier integrity. Also, ZO-1 and occludin immunoexpressions, confirming hBMEPC interactions in vitro, may reflect post-transplant cell actions in vivo.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In clinical oncology, drug resistance limits the efficacy of most anticancer treatments, and identification of major mechanisms remains a key to solve this challenging issue. Here, we highlight the multifaceted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which comprises numerous soluble factors including amphiregulin (AREG). Production of AREG is triggered by DNA damage to stromal cells, which passively enter senescence in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a process that remarkably enhances cancer malignancy including acquired resistance mediated by EGFR. Furthermore, paracrine AREG induces programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in recipient cancer cells and creates an immunosuppressive TME via immune checkpoint activation against cytotoxic lymphocytes. Targeting AREG not only minimized chemoresistance of cancer cells, but also restored immunocompetency when combined with classical chemotherapy in humanized animals. Our study underscores the potential of in vivo SASP in driving the TME-mediated drug resistance and shaping an immunosuppressive niche, and provides the proof of principle of targeting major SASP factors to improve therapeutic outcome in cancer medicine, the success of which can substantially reduce aging-related morbidity and mortality.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Global hypomethylation mainly affects highly methylated repeat sequences, such as transposable elements; it is an essentially stochastic process usually referred to as 'epigenetic drift.' Specific changes in DNA methylation affect various genome sequences and could be either hypomethylation or hypermethylation, but the prevailing tendencies are hypermethylation of promoter sequences associated with CpG islands and hypomethylation of CpG poor genes. Methylation levels of multiple CpG sites display a strong correlation to age common between individuals of the same species. Collectively, methylation of such CpG sites could be used as 'epigenetic clocks' to predict biological age. Furthermore, the discrepancy between epigenetic and chronological ages could be predictive of all-cause mortality and multiple age-associated diseases. Random changes in DNA methylation (epigenetic drift) could also affect the aging phenotype, causing accidental changes in gene expression and increasing the transcriptional noise between cells of the same tissue. Both effects could become detrimental to tissue functioning and cause a gradual decline in organ function during aging. Strong evidence shows that epigenetic systems contribute to lifespan control in various organisms. Similar to other cell systems, the epigenome is prone to gradual degradation due to the genome damage, stressful agents and other aging factors. However, unlike mutations and many other hallmarks of aging, age-related epigenetic changes could be fully or partially reversed to a 'young' state.</AbstractText>"}

In this article we have reviewed the potential role of CoQ10 supplementation in the treatment of tissue fibrosis, which has been implicated in the age-related loss of function of various organs including the heart. Clinical studies have indicated that CoQ10 supplementation may decrease the level of cardiovascular fibrosis to which older individuals are subjected, and thereby improve cardiovascular function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular associated mortality.

The capacity of biological systems to continuously adjust for optimal functioning despite ever changing environments is essential for healthy aging, and variability in these adaptive homeostatic mechanisms may reflect such heterogeneity in the aging process. With an ever-increasing aging population, interest in biomarkers of aging is growing. Although no universally accepted definition of biomarkers of healthy aging exists, mediators of homeostasis are consistently used as measures of the aging process. As important sex differences are known to underlie many of these systems, it is imperative to consider that this may reflect, to some extent, the sex differences observed in aging and age-related disease states. This chapter aims to outline sex differences in key homeostatic domains thought to be associated with the pathophysiology of aging, often proposed as biomarkers of aging and age-related disease states.

Here, providing a broader definition of aging biomarkers, we review cutting-edge research on aging biomarkers at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, thus shedding light on the relations between aging and telomeres, longevity proteins, a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, the gut microbiota and metabolic patterns. Furthermore, we evaluate the suitability of these aging biomarkers for the development of novel antiaging targets on the basis of the most recent research on this topic.

Several studies have associated energy metabolism dysfunction with the disorder, mostly related to glycolysis alterations. Glucose is the obligatory energy substrate of the brain and glycolysis is the first step for its metabolism.

Thus, glial cells generate either lactate or pyruvate to neurons for ATP production. In addition, some aspects of schizophrenia may reflect an advanced aging phenotype with effects on various neural cell types at different stages of the disease. Given the role of glial cells in brain energy metabolism, the association of glycolysis dysfunction and the accelerated aging of neuronal cells in schizophrenia, studies focusing on those aspects can yield important insights into the causes and implications of the disorder.

This critical technological advancement allows temporal control of DNA-cre recombination, avoidance of embryonically lethal phenotypes, and minimization of residual cell labeling encountered in constitutively active drivers. Despite its advantages, the use of Tam has the potential to cause long-lasting, uncharacterized side effects on the transcriptome and epigenome in the CNS, given its mixed estrogen receptor (ER) agonist/antagonist actions. With the welcome focus on including both sexes in biomedical studies and efforts to understand sex differences, Tam administration could also cause sexually divergent responses that would confound studies. To examine these issues, epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles were compared in C57BL/6 J female and male hippocampus, cortex, and retina 1 month after a 5-day Tam treatment typical for cre induction, or vehicle control (sunflower seed oil). Cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation levels, in both CG and non-CG contexts, were unchanged as determined by oxidative bisulfite sequencing. Long-lasting Tam transcriptomic effects were also not evident/minimal. Furthermore, there is no evidence of sexually divergent responses with Tam administration and Tam did not alter sex differences evident in controls. Combined with recently reported data that Tam alone does not cause long-lasting changes in behavior and neurogenesis, our findings provide confidence that Tam can be used as a cre-recombinase inducer without introducing significant confounds in transcriptomic and epigenomic neuroscience studies, particularly those focused on genomic and transcriptomic aspects of the aging brain.</AbstractText>"}

Functional and molecular analysis showed that OCT1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice are partially protected from CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity and peripheral neurotoxicity, whereas ototoxicity was not detectable. Surprisingly, proteomic analysis of the kidneys demonstrated that genetic deletion of OCT1/2 itself was associated with significant changes in expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic proteins which are part of an OCT-associated protein network. This signature directly regulated by OCT consisted of three classes of proteins, viz., profibrotic proteins, proinflammatory proteins, and nutrient sensing molecules. Consistent with functional protection, CDDP-induced proteome changes were more severe in WT mice than in OCT1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the presence of OCT was not associated with higher renal platinum concentrations.

Here, we explore whether the source of synaptic inputs to the motor neurons (cats) and the age or post-stroke conditions (humans) may change the recruitment gain of the motor neuron pool. In cats, the size of Ia EPSPs in triceps surae motor neurons (input) and monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs; output) was recorded in the soleus and medial gastrocnemius motor nerves following graded stimulation of dorsal roots. The MSR was plotted against the EPSP thereby obtaining a measure of the recruitment gain. Conditioning stimulation of sural and peroneal cutaneous afferents caused significant increase in the recruitment gain of the medial gastrocnemius, but not the soleus motor neuron pool. In humans, the discharge probability of individual soleus motor units (input) and soleus H-reflexes (output) was performed. With graded stimulation of the tibial nerve, the gain of the motor neuron pool was assessed as the slope of the relation between probability of firing and the reflex size. The gain in young subjects was higher than in elderly subjects. The gain in post-stroke survivors was higher than in age-matched neurologically intact subjects. These findings provide experimental evidence that recruitment gain of a motor neuron pool contributes to the regulation of movement at the final output stage from the spinal cord and should be considered when interpreting changes in reflex excitability in relation to movement or injuries of the nervous system.</AbstractText>"}

Nat Biotechnol 34:531-538, 2016) of rare variants that confer resistance to Mendelian disease, and protective alleles for some complex diseases, we posited the existence of genetic variants that promote resilience to highly heritable polygenic disorders1,0 such as schizophrenia. Resilience has been traditionally viewed as a psychological construct, although our use of the term resilience refers to a different construct that directly relates to the Resilience Project, namely: heritable variation that promotes resistance to disease by reducing the penetrance of risk loci, wherein resilience and risk loci operate orthogonal to one another. In this study, we established a procedure to identify unaffected individuals with relatively high polygenic risk for schizophrenia, and contrasted them with risk-matched schizophrenia cases to generate the first known 'polygenic resilience score' that represents the additive contributions to SZ resistance by variants that are distinct from risk loci. The resilience score was derived from data compiled by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and replicated in three independent samples. This work establishes a generalizable framework for finding resilience variants for any complex, heritable disorder.</AbstractText>"}

Sirtuins confer protection from a wide array of metabolic and age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have also suggested that sirtuins regulate autophagy, a protective cellular process for homeostatic maintenance in response to environmental stresses. Here, we describe various biological and pathophysiological processes regulated by sirtuin-mediated autophagy, focusing on cancer, heart, and liver diseases, as well as stem cell biology. This review also emphasizes key molecular mechanisms by which sirtuins regulate autophagy. Finally, we discuss novel insights into how new therapeutics targeting sirtuin and autophagy may potentially lead to effective strategies to combat aging and aging-related diseases.</AbstractText>"}

However, despite comprehensive efforts, effective therapeutics that can target oncogenic KRAS are still under investigation or awaiting clinical approval. Using a specific KRAS-dependent gene signature, we implemented a computer-assisted inspection of a drug-gene network to <i>in silico</i> repurpose drugs that work like inhibitors of oncogenic KRAS. We identified and validated decitabine, an FDA-approved drug, as a potent inhibitor of growth in pancreatic cancer cells and patient-derived xenograft models that showed KRAS dependency. Mechanistically, decitabine efficacy was linked to KRAS-driven dependency on nucleotide metabolism and its ability to specifically impair pyrimidine biosynthesis in KRAS-dependent tumors cells. These findings also showed that gene signatures related to KRAS dependency might be prospectively used to inform on decitabine sensitivity in a selected subset of patients with KRAS-mutated pancreatic cancer. Overall, the repurposing of decitabine emerged as an intriguing option for treating pancreatic tumors that are addicted to mutant KRAS, thus offering opportunities for improving the arsenal of therapeutics for this extremely deadly disease.

The effect of the nanoparticles on the growth of intermetallic compounds during isothermal aging was investigated. It was found that the addition of Mo nanoparticle markedly suppressed the increase in thickness of the interfacial intermetallic compounds layer during isothermal aging. The atomic diffusion coefficients during isothermal aging in Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu solder and in the novel doped solder were determined experimentally. Mo nanoparticles were found to decrease the diffusion coefficient in the composite solder. The high specific surface area of the nanoparticles makes them easily adsorbed and hinders the diffusion of Sn and Cu atoms. This is consistent with an increase in the diffusion activation energy due to the addition of Mo nanoparticles in Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu solder.</AbstractText>"}

Respondents were stratified based on the Danish version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Using frequency and logistic regression procedures combined with model-assisted weights based on national registers, results showed that the most common opportunities at the workplace were possibilities for more vacation, reduction of working hours, flexible working hours, access to treatment, further education and physical exercise. However, ISCO groups 5-9 (mainly physical work and shorter education) had in general poorer access to these opportunities than ISCO groups 1-4 (mainly seated work and longer education). Women had poorer access than men, and workers with reduced work ability had poorer access than those with full work ability. Thus, in contrast with actual needs, opportunities at the workplace were lower in occupations characterized by physical work and shorter education, among women and among workers with reduced work ability.

Clinical","Date":"2019","Keywords":"Dementia, Exercise, Fitness, MRI, Neuroimaging, Physical activity","Abstract":"<AbstractText>Current treatment in late-life cognitive impairment and dementia is still limited, and there is no cure for brain tissue degeneration or reversal of cognitive decline. Physical activity represents a promising non-pharmacological interventional approach in many diseases causing cognitive impairment, but its effect on brain integrity is still largely unknown. Especially research of cerebral alterations in disease state that goes beyond observations of clinical improvement is crucial to understand disease processes and possible effective treatments. In this systematic review, we address the question how physical activity and fitness in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) influences brain architecture compared to cognitively healthy elderly. We review both interventional studies comprising aerobic, coordinative and resistance exercises and observational studies on fitness and physical activity combined with Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI). Different MRI approaches were included such as volumetric and structural analyses, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), functional MRI and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF). We evaluate MRI results for different exercise modalities and performed a methodological evaluation of interventional studies in cognitive decline compared to normal aging. According to our results, among 12 interventions in AD/MCI, aerobic exercise is most frequently applied (9 studies). Interventions in AD/MCI altogether reveal a higher methodological quality compared to interventions in healthy elderly (8.33 ± 2.19 vs. 6.25 ± 2.36 out of 13 points), with most frequent missing aspects related to descriptions of complications, lack of intention-to-treat and statistical power analyses. Effects of aerobic exercise and fitness seem to mainly impact brain structures sensitive to neurodegeneration, which especially comprise frontal, temporal and parietal regions, such as the hippocampal/parahippocampal region, precuneus, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex, which are reported by several studies. General fitness measured via an objective fitness assessment and questionnaires seems to have a more global cerebral effect, probably due to its long-term application, whereas distinct intervention effects of durations between 3 and 6 months seem to concentrate on more local brain regions as the hippocampus, which can also be influenced by region of interest analyses. There is still a lack of evidence on other or combined types of intervention modalities, such as resistance, coordinative as well as multicomponent exercise during cognitive decline, and complex interventions as dancing. Future research should examine their beneficial effect on brain integrity, since several non-MRI studies already point to their advantageous impact. As a further future prospect, combination and application of newly developed imaging methods such as metabolic imaging should be envisaged to understand physical activity and its cerebral influence under its many-sided facets.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

The effects have been followed by electronic absorption, its second derivative spectra, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Upon addition of the additives, a final form is reached after about 24 h. It is characterized by a 4 nm red-shifted Soret band compared to that typical of the oxy species (418 nm) but with similar Q bands. Resonance Raman experiments carried out in <sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub> allowed us to identify the presence of the native oxy form coexisting with a second oxygen bound species, characterized by a ν(FeO<sub>2</sub>) stretching frequency upshifted 7 cm<sup>-1</sup> compared to the native oxy form and with a greater (33 cm<sup>-1</sup>) isotopic shift in <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. These data suggest the presence of a highly bent ligand conformation. The new species induced by the addition of the additives imparts a red colour to the tuna fish meat, a characteristic that is of some concern. In fact, the presence of the new red form can mask the aging of the product that, consequently, might contain histamine. Furthermore, the electronic absorption spectrum is very similar to that of the tuna fish myoglobin carbon monoxide complex, which has important regulatory consequences. Carbon monoxide treatment of tuna is banned in the EU for masking the effects of aging on the appearance of meats.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The materials were presumed to be oxo-biodegradable plastics with thicknesses varying between 30 and 70 μm, and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) filler content reaching up to 11 wt%. Accelerated (aging) weathering tests conducted revealed that UV radiation triggered the biodegradation mechanism. Weight loss reached 50% after exposure to weathering which was attributed to triggering the fragmentation of the plastic films. Furthermore, some 83% of weight loss was estimated after 12 months of soil burial. Fluctuation of weight in mid exposure time spans was related to the cross-linking reaction within the polymeric matrix. The mechanical properties investigated along with the thermal stability profile determined for the materials showed that weathering was more severe than soil burial. Thermogravimetry revealed that onset temperature (T<sub>os</sub>) was lower than conventional PO products by 25 °C. This could be attributed to the thermal response of the materials due to presence of ion salts and sterates within their composition. The claims by the manufacturing companies which provided the original specimens under an environmentally friendly pretence is disputed due to the fact that none of the products actually showed evidence of major fragmentation or deterioration after exposure to harsh environments. The work also paves the way in standardising assessment methodology for examining biodegradable plastics.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The molecular switch between senescent and apoptotic fate remains, however, poorly recognized. Nrf2 is an important transcription factor orchestrating adaptive response to cellular stress. Here, we show that both human primary endothelial cells (ECs) and murine aortas lacking Nrf2 signaling are senescent but unexpectedly do not encounter damaging oxidative stress. Instead, they exhibit markedly increased S-nitrosation of proteins. A functional role of S-nitrosation is protection of ECs from death by inhibition of NOX4-mediated oxidative damage and redirection of ECs to premature senescence. S-nitrosation and senescence are mediated by Keap1, a direct binding partner of Nrf2, which colocalizes and precipitates with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and transnitrosating protein GAPDH in ECs devoid of Nrf2. We conclude that the overabundance of this 'unrestrained' Keap1 determines the fate of ECs by regulation of S-nitrosation and propose that Keap1/GAPDH/NOS complex may serve as an enzymatic machinery for S-nitrosation in mammalian cells.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Thirty older adults with SCD (Mean Age = 69.34, SD = 5.34) completed a neurocognitive test battery, including the California Verbal Learning Test, which was used to assess semantic clustering. One week later, participants were admitted to the laboratory for a two night visit. SWA and sleep fragmentation were captured using sleep polysomnography. Next-day memory performance was tested using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Poorer sleep (reduced SWA; increased arousals) was associated with reduced semantic clustering, which mediated impairment on verbal memory and learning tests conducted both the day after sleep was recorded (for both SWA and arousals), and a week prior (for arousals only). We demonstrate semantic clustering mediated the well described associations between sleep and verbal memory.

However, changes in UPR activation and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the testis during ageing remain unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that UPR activation declines and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated in the testis during ageing, and these changes are associated with a decline in testicular function. To test this theory, we utilized 6-, 12-, 18-, and 22-month-old Sprague Dawley rats to evaluate the changes in testicular and epididymal weights and indexes, sperm quality, histology, UPR activation, and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in testicular tissues. The results showed that there was a progressive decline in testicular and epididymal weights and indexes, sperm count, and sperm viability during ageing. Correspondingly, seminiferous tubule diameters and epithelium heights progressively decreased with ageing. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining results revealed that the expression of UPR-related proteins (GRP78, p-PERK, p-eif2α, ATF4, p-IRE1α, ATF6α, and XBP1) progressively decreased in the testis with ageing. In contrast, the expression of ER stress-related pro-apoptotic proteins CHOP, Caspase 12, and p-JNK progressively increased with advancing age. TUNEL staining further confirmed that testicular germ cell apoptosis was significantly increased from month 6 to 22 in rats. Additionally, the relative expression levels of cytochrome c and its downstream molecules including Capsase 9 and Caspase 3 were significantly increased in the testis during ageing. Collectively, our results suggest that impaired UPR activation and increased germ cell apoptosis partly mediated by the UPR and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might correlate with an age-related decline in testicular function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol and antagonist bicuculline were administered for moderate system activation and inhibition, respectively. EEGs from the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were recorded under spontaneous state and during Y-maze performance. Basally, AD mice exhibited increased spontaneous EEG delta (2-4 Hz) and decreased spontaneous EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the Hip, and decreased Y-maze EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity in the PFC. Interestingly, GABA<sub>A</sub> activation and inhibition in AD mice reduced EEG delta activity and increased EEG theta activity in the PFC, and behaviorally improved spatial recognition memory during Y-maze testing. Decreased spontaneous EEG delta activity was also observed in the PFC. Specifically, GABA<sub>A</sub> activation primarily affected low frequency EEG (2-12 Hz) activity in the PFC, whereas inhibition affected EEG activity across many frequencies in the PFC and Hip.

Importantly, improved spatial memory after GABA<sub>A</sub> activation and inhibition may be explained by brain rhythm recovery in certain regions. Our study highlights the potential clinical use of GABA<sub>A</sub> drugs to improve cognitive disorders and restore neural network activity in AD.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of extract treatment on astrocyte viability, spontaneous migration and apoptosis was evaluated. Anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant effects were investigated on isolated rat cortexes exposed to a neurotoxic stimulus. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, nitrite levels and 5-HT turnover were evaluated, as well. A proteomic analysis was focused on specific neuronal proteins and a fingerprint analysis was carried out on selected phenolic compounds. Both extracts appeared able to exert in vitro anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. S. alba and T. parthenium extracts reduced LDH release, nitrite levels and 5-HT turnover induced by neurotoxic stimulus. The downregulation of selected proteins suggest a neurotoxicity, which could be ascribed to an elevated content of gallic acid in both S. alba and T. parthenium extracts.

Telomere length was measured both at baseline and at follow-up using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Physical performance was evaluated only at follow-up using the Senior Fitness Test (SFT), which assesses strength, flexibility and endurance. In women, shorter telomere length at follow-up (p = 0.044) and greater telomere attrition during follow-up time (p = 0.022) were associated with poorer physical performance after adjusting for covariates (age at baseline, smoking status, body mass index at baseline, follow-up time and educational attainment). No similar associations were found for men. This indicates that, at least in women, telomere length could potentially be used as a biomarker for physical performance, however, more longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this association.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Primary cultured mouse neurons were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke in vitro, then randomized into a hypoxia conditioned aged human BMSCs-conditioned medium (BMSC-hypoCM) versus normoxia conditioned (BMSC-norCM). After 22 h of reperfusion, cell viability was significantly increased in neurons treated with BMSC-hypoCM rather than BMSC-norCM.

Here, we investigated the protective effect of Psiadia punctulata (PP) on advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-induced aggravated vasoconstriction. The effect of total methanol extract of PP leaves (PPT) on AGE-induced vascular injury was studied through bioassay-guided fractionation procedures in order to find the bioactive fraction and isolate the bioactive compounds. Vascular reactivity was studied using the isolated artery technique by adding cumulative concentrations of phenylephrine (PE) or acetyl choline (ACh). In addition, the antiglycating effect, as well as the effect on AGEs intermediates dityrosine and N`-formylkynurenine and their radical scavenging activity were measured. The results showed that PPT alleviated the AGEs-induced aggravated vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent manner. The bioassay guided fractionation procedures suggested the chloroform fraction (Fr I) to be responsible for the activity. Chemical investigation of this fraction resulted in isolation of four major bioactive compounds that were identified as: umuhengerin (1), gardenin (2), luteolin-3`,4`-dimethyl ether (3), and 5,3`-dihydroxy-6,7,4`,5`-tetramethoxyflavone (4). The four compounds alleviated the exaggerated vasoconstriction in a dose dependent manner. In search for their mechanism of action, we observed that PPT, Fr. I and the isolated compounds did not improve the impaired vasodilation associated with AGEs exposure. PPT, Fr. I and the isolated compounds 1-4 inhibited AGEs formation and their protein oxidation intermediates. Furthermore, PPT, Fr. I and the isolated compounds 1-4 showed weak radical scavenging activity with compound 4 as the most potent. In conclusion, PPT appears to protect against AGEs-induced exaggerated vasoconstriction through antiglycation and radical scavenging activities.</AbstractText>"}

Senescent stem cells have a negative effect on the self-repair on IVD degeneration. In this review, we delineate that the factors such as telomerase shortening, DNA damage, oxidative stress, microenvironment and exosomes will induce stem cell aging. Recent studies tried to delay the aging of stem cells by regulating the expression of aging-related genes and proteins, changing the activity of telomerase, improving the survival microenvironment of stem cells and drug treatment.

As social networks change, especially when accompanied by health decline, older adults' sources of support change and their well-being is challenged. Previous studies predominantly used quantitative measures to examine how older adults' social networks change. Alternatively, this study explores the impact of changing social networks on older adults' lives by examining their personal experiences. We held four focus groups, two with a total of 14 older adults who are ageing in place and receiving home care and two with a total of 20 home-care nurses from different regions and organisations in the Netherlands. Subsequently, an expert team of home-care professionals and managers discussed and verified the results. Procedures for grounded theory building were used for analysis. We revealed four themes of high-impact experiences: (a) struggling with illness/death of the spouse; (b) working out a changing relationship with (grand)children; (c) regretting the loss of people they have known for so long and (d) feeling dependent and stressed when helpers enter the network. Also, network dynamics were found to follow three consecutive stages: (a) awareness of social network change; (b) surprise when social network change actually occurs and (c) acceptance and adjusting to new circumstances. Together, the four themes of experiences and three stages of network change form an integrative model of the role of social network dynamics for older adults' lives when ageing in place.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In this work, we describe the effects of a semisynthetic derivative of [6]-gingerol (6G) called SSi6, produced by the addition of a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent on several aspects of triple-negative breast cancer biology. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A were used in the experiments. MTT assays were used to detect cell viability. Cell cycle and apoptosis assay were analyzed using flow cytometer Accuri C6 and analysis of proteins as retinoblastoma Rb and kinases Cdk4/6 were analyzed by western blotting. SSi6 induced cytotoxic effects on triple-negative breast cancer cells, with higher selectivity when compared to the non-tumor MCF-10A cells. In addition, SSi6 inhibited migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells and was able to arrest cell cycle at the G1-phase, mainly by decreasing Cdk4/6-Rb axis levels. Therefore, SSi6 provoked the induction of apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells. SSi6 was more efficient in producing these effects, compared to the original 6G natural product. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the effects of natural and semisynthetic products on the in-vitro metastatic processes in the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line. Additional, it can be useful to understand the effects of chemical modifications on already effective natural compounds aiming at the improvement of their bioactive properties, such as in the increase of the cytotoxic selectivity against tumor cells, compared to non-tumor ones.</AbstractText>"}

Herein, we address the molecular mechanisms affecting endothelium remodeling in disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disorder, and renal failure, being a common feature in aging, diabetes, dyslipidemia, abnormal valve biomechanics, end-stage renal disease and atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress promotes calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by increasing osteogenic transcription factors expression and activity in atherosclerotic plaques. Various markers of osteogenic differentiation are expressed by SMC in calcified atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, decreased levels of some bone factors and microRNAs accelerate vascular calcification and injured tissue regeneration. Another key player in endothelial remodeling is amino acids metabolism. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized in several nonhepatic tissues including cardiac muscle. Immune activation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease patients associate with higher phenylalanine/tyrosine ratios.

The central nucleus (CeA) serves major amygdala output functions related to emotional-affective behaviors and pain modulation. Our previous studies implicated the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system in amygdala plasticity and pain behaviors in an arthritis model. We also showed that serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtype 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) contributes to increased CeA output and neuropathic pain-like behaviors. Here, we tested the novel hypothesis that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R in the BLA drives CRF1 receptor activation to increase CeA neuronal activity in neuropathic pain. Extracellular single-unit recordings of CeA neurons in anesthetized adult male rats detected increased activity in neuropathic rats (spinal nerve ligation model) compared to sham controls. Increased CeA activity was blocked by local knockdown or pharmacological blockade of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R in the BLA, using stereotaxic administration of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R short hairpin RNA (shRNA) viral vector or a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R antagonist (SB242084), respectively. Stereotaxic administration of a CRF1 receptor antagonist (NBI27914) into the BLA also decreased CeA activity in neuropathic rats and blocked the facilitatory effects of a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist (WAY161503) administered stereotaxically into the BLA. Conversely, local (BLA) knockdown of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R eliminated the inhibitory effect of NBI27914 and the facilitatory effect of WAY161503 in neuropathic rats.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating effects of total energy expenditure and intake, body mass, and body image dissatisfaction on the relationship between age and perception of health and quality of life. Forty-two senior athletes, 55 physically active, and 61 sedentary individuals (aged 55-84 years) were evaluated for total energy expenditure (EE), energy intake (EI), body mass index (BMI), absolute Body Dissatisfaction Index (BDIabx), and physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health and quality of life perception. Multiple mediation analyses were applied to assess the relationship between age and PCS and MCS indices, through the mediators EE, EI, BMI, and BDIabx. For MCS, but not for PSC, the mediation analysis showed: (a) a direct effect of age; (b) a mediation path through EE, EI, BMI, and BDIabx; and (c) a positive total effect. The combination of positive and negative mediating effects influencing the mental health perception underlined that with advancing age, the maintenance of high levels of energy expenditure through physical activity could positively impact body image satisfaction and, in turn, mental health.</AbstractText>"}

One of the best-studied models is the prematurely aging mtDNA mutator mouse, which carries a homozygous knock-in of a proofreading deficient version of the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase-γ (PolgA). We investigated how voluntary exercise affects the progression of aging phenotypes in this mouse, focusing on mitochondrial and protein homeostasis in both brain and peripheral tissues. Voluntary exercise significantly ameliorated several aspects of the premature aging phenotype, including decreased locomotor activity, alopecia, and kyphosis, but did not have major effects on the decreased lifespan of mtDNA mutator mice. Exercise also decreased the mtDNA mutation load. In-depth tissue proteomics revealed that exercise normalized the levels of about half the proteins, with the majority involved in mitochondrial function and nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk. There was also a specific increase in the nuclear-encoded proteins needed for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and complex II, but not in mitochondrial-encoded oxidative phosphorylation proteins, as well as normalization of enzymes involved in coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found tissue-specific alterations, with brain coping better as compared to muscle and with motor cortex being better protected than striatum, in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that voluntary exercise counteracts aging in mtDNA mutator mice by counteracting protein dysregulation in muscle and brain, decreasing the mtDNA mutation burden in muscle, and delaying overt aging phenotypes.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

In many countries age specific risk of dementia has declined, but whether this is also the case for subclinical cognitive impairment is unknown. This has important implications for prevention, planning and policy. Here we describe subclinical cognitive impairment and mild dementia prevalence changes, in the UK, over 2 decades. The Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies have examined the full spectrum of cognition, from normal to dementia, in representative populations of people aged ≥ 65 years in the UK over the last 2 decades 7635 participants were interviewed in CFAS I in Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham in 1991, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed. In the same geographical areas, the CFAS II investigators interviewed 7796 individuals in 2011. Using established criteria, the population was categorised into seven groups: no cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive Impairment (defined using consensus criteria), other cognitive impairment no dementia without functional impairment, OCIND with functional impairment, cognitive impairment (MMSE &lt; 24 and no functional impairment), mild dementia (MMSE &lt; 24 with functional impairment, not captured by CFAS dementia criteria), and CFAS dementia criteria. Multinomial logistic regression, adjusted for age and sex, was used to estimate the prevalence of impairment in both studies. Results were standardized to the age-sex specific UK and global population. There is a clear increase in the prevalence of other cognitive Impairment no Dementia (without functional impairment), with the purer MCI remaining stable. In the UK, mild dementia is estimated to fall from 520,704 cases (5.7%, 95% CI 3.8, 8.1) in 1991 to 315,142 (3.0%, 95% CI 2.4, 3.8) in 2011, cognitive impairment, has fallen from 1,225,984 (13.5%, 95% CI 10.1, 17.5) to 654,436 (6.3%, 95% CI 5.4, 7.3) cases. Using additional categories which reflect the continuum of cognitive decline and impairment in populations we see that the mildest dementia declines, but that there is stability in estimates of those who meet MCI criteria. Increases were found in the Other Cognitive Impairment no Dementia group. The decline observed in severe impairment thus seems to have resulted in larger proportions of the population in milder forms, seen alongside physical illnesses.</AbstractText>"}

Glycosylation characteristics can affect protein structure and function. This study compares glycosylation characteristics of A2M in newborn umbilical cord (NUCP) and adult pooled plasmas. Peptide N-Glycosidase F treatment was used to evaluate the total N-glycan content of the molecules. Neuraminidase treatment, and affinity for Ricinus Communis Agglutinin I were used to examine terminal sialic acid and galactose content, respectively. Two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis was used to determine charge-related isoform profiles and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) was used to characterize N-glycan profiles. Results revealed no difference in total N-glycan mass, however, a statistically significant difference was shown in the change in charge associated with sialic acid loss in the NUCP A2M population. 2D electrophoresis indicated a lower pI range for NUCP A2M isoforms. In addition, NUCP A2M displayed a trend toward higher terminal galactose quantities than adult A2M. FACE revealed an increased abundance of more branched, higher molecular weight glycans in NUCP A2M. These differences in glycan branching and charged residues may impact A2M receptor-based clearance and thus could be responsible for the increased A2M concentration seen in NUCP, and newborns.</AbstractText>"}

Interventions that restore a youthful state delay or reverse these processes, prompting the search for systemic regulators of metabolic and immune homeostasis. Here we identify MANF, a secreted stress-response protein with immune modulatory properties, as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of systemic and in particular liver metabolic homeostasis. We show that MANF levels decline with age in flies, mice and humans, and MANF overexpression extends lifespan in flies. MANF deficient flies exhibit enhanced inflammation and shorter lifespans, and MANF heterozygous mice exhibit inflammatory phenotypes in various tissues, as well as progressive liver damage, fibrosis, and steatosis. We show that immune cell-derived MANF protects against liver inflammation and fibrosis, while hepatocyte-derived MANF prevents hepatosteatosis. Liver rejuvenation by heterochronic parabiosis in mice further depends on MANF, while MANF supplementation ameliorates several hallmarks of liver aging, prevents hepatosteatosis induced by diet, and improves age-related metabolic dysfunction. Our findings identify MANF as a systemic regulator of homeostasis in young animals, suggesting a therapeutic application for MANF in age-related metabolic diseases.</AbstractText>"}

This technical report describes a convenient relatively noninvasive procedure for counting white blood cells in C57Bl/6 mice by an optimized tail blood collection method followed by Wright-Giemsa and Türk staining. This technique can be performed on unanesthetized mice in less than 1 min with minimal stress using only a few microliters of blood. White blood cell analysis can include but is not limited to total and differential white blood cell count and cell morphology. The low blood volume collected is ideal for aging mice in longer-term experiments requiring regular and continuous monitoring.</AbstractText>"}

In order to solve these problems, researchers continue to develop therapeutic agents, increase the efficacy of developed therapeutic agents, and reduce side effects. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are widely used in tissue engineering applications as biosensors, drug delivery carriers, and bioactive materials. Their special surface property enables easy conjugation with ligands including functional groups such as thiols, phosphines, and amines. This creates an attractive advantage to GNPs for use in the bone tissue engineering field. However, GNPs alone are limited in their biological effects. In this study, we used thiol-PEG-vitamin D (SPVD) to conjugate vitamin D, an essential nutrient critical for maintaining normal skeletal homeostasis, to GNPs. To characterize vitamin D-conjugated GNPs (VGNPs), field emission transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and ultraviolet/visible absorption analysis were carried out. The developed VGNPs were well bound through the thiol groups between GNPs and vitamin D, and were fabricated in size of 60 nm. Moreover, to demonstrate VGNPs osteogenic differentiation effect, various assays were carried out through cell viability test, alkaline phosphatase assay, calcium deposition assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence staining. As a result, the fabricated VGNPs were found to effectively enhance osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) <i>in vitro</i>. Based on these results, VGNPs can be utilized as functional nanomaterials for bone regeneration in the tissue engineering field.</AbstractText>"}

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is commonly observed in menopausal women and is characterised by a collection of symptoms resulting from changes to the internal and external genitalia as well as the lower urinary tract. Several studies have demonstrated the close association between sexual dysfunction and symptoms related to GSM. Many medications, at different doses, have been studied over the years for the treatment of the symptoms of GSM. More specifically, ultralow-dose intravaginal oestriol and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are reported to improve symptoms, signs, and quality of life of women with GSM, and they are safe owing to their specific local effect. While the dosage and the administration of intravaginal DHEA are well defined, the literature on intravaginal oestriol is less uniform: different doses and times of administration are proposed with different possible combinations with other non-pharmacological therapies, although a more standardised treatment may be necessary. The aim of this review is to summarise the available data about the effects of ultralow-concentration oestriol and intravaginal DHEA on the menopause-related symptoms, quality of life, and sexual function of women affected by GSM.</AbstractText>"}

Furthermore, it has not been possible to separate boundary versus goal direction signals in the EC/subiculum. Here, to address these questions, we had participants learn a virtual environment containing four unique boundaries. Participants then underwent fMRI scanning where they made judgements about the allocentric direction of a cue object. Using multivariate decoding, we found information regarding allocentric boundary direction in posterior EC and subiculum, whereas allocentric goal direction was decodable from anterior EC and subiculum. These data provide the first evidence of allocentric boundary coding in humans, and are consistent with recent conceptualisations of a division of labour within the EC.</AbstractText>"}

Abnormalities in neuron axonal transport-related proteins prevent autophagosome maturation in AD. Curcumin, a polyphenol plant compound, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects by increasing autophagy in AD, but the underlying mechanism of its effect on autophagy axon transport remains elusive. This study investigated the effects of curcumin on autophagosome formation and axonal transport in N2a/APP695swe cells (AD cell model) as well as the mechanism underlying those effects. Curcumin treatment significantly increased the expression of Beclin1, Atg5, and Atg16L1, induced the formation of autophagosomes, and promoted autophagosome-lysosome fusion in N2a/APP695swe cells. At the same time, curcumin promoted the expression of dynein, dynactin, and BICD2 as well as their binding to form the retrograde axonal transport molecular motor complex. Moreover, curcumin also increased the expression of the scaffolding proteins Rab7- interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) and huntingtin in N2a/APP695swe cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that curcumin increases autophagic flux by promoting interactions among autophagic axonal transport-related proteins and inducing lysosome-autophagosome fusion.

A dominant particle type from BB is spherical organic aerosol particles commonly referred to as tarballs. Currently, tarballs can only be identified, using microscopy, from their uniquely spherical shapes following impaction onto a grid. Despite their abundance and potential significance for climate, many unanswered questions related to their formation, emission inventory, removal processes, and optical properties still remain. Here, we report analysis that supports tarball formation in which primary organic particles undergo chemical and physical processing within ∼3 h of emission. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the number fractions of tarballs and the ratios of N and O relative to K, the latter a conserved tracer, increase with particle age and that the more-spherical particles on the substrates had higher ratios of N and O relative to K. Scanning transmission X-ray spectrometry and electron energy loss spectrometry analyses show that these chemical changes are accompanied by the formation of organic compounds that contain nitrogen and carboxylic acid. The results imply that the chemical changes increase the particle sphericity on the substrates, which correlates with particle surface tension and viscosity, and contribute to tarball formation during aging in BB smoke. These findings will enable models to better partition tarball contributions to BB radiative forcing and, in so doing, better help constrain radiative forcing models of BB events.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Despite the current paradigm, which suggests consistent, highly synchronized spawning events, corals that reproduce by broadcast spawning are particularly vulnerable because their reproductive phenology is governed by environmental cues. Here, we quantify coral spawning intensity during four annual reproductive seasons, alongside laboratory analyses at the polyp, colony, and population levels, and we demonstrate that, compared with historical data, several species from the Red Sea have lost their reproductive synchrony. Ultimately, such a synchrony breakdown reduces the probability of successful fertilization, leading to a dearth of new recruits, which may drive aging populations to extinction.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Given their high whole-organism metabolic rate and the importance of flight in foraging and predator avoidance, flight muscle deterioration and accumulated oxidative stress and tissue deterioration may be an important contributor to physiological senescence in wild birds. As a by-product of aerobic respiration, reactive oxygen species are produced and can cause structural damage within cells. The anti-oxidant system deters oxidative damage to macromolecules. We examined oxidative stress and muscle ultrastructure in thick-billed murres aged 8 to 37 years (<i>N</i>=50) in pectoralis muscle biopsies. When considered in general linear models with body mass, body size and sex, no oxidative stress parameter varied with age. In contrast, there was a decrease in myonuclear domain similar to that seen in human muscle aging. We conclude that for wild birds with very high flight activity levels, muscle ultrastructural changes may be an important contributor to demographic senescence. Such gradual, linear declines in muscle morphology may eventually contribute to 'catastrophic' failure in foraging or predator avoidance abilities, leading to demographic senescence.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

We demonstrate that Sap47 modulates the phosphorylation of another highly abundant conserved presynaptic protein, synapsin. Site-specific phosphorylation of <i>Drosophila</i> synapsin has repeatedly been shown to be important for behavioural plasticity but it was not known where these phospho-synapsin isoforms are localized in the brain. Here, we report the distribution of serine-6-phosphorylated synapsin in the adult brain and show that it is highly enriched in rings of synapses in the ellipsoid body and in large synapses near the lateral triangle. The effects of knockout of <i>Sap47</i> or <i>synapsin</i> on olfactory associative learning/memory support the hypothesis that both proteins operate in the same molecular pathway. We therefore asked if this might also be true for other aspects of their function. We show that knockout of <i>Sap47</i> but not <i>synapsin</i> reduces lifespan, whereas knockout of <i>Sap47</i> and <i>synapsin</i>, either individually or together, affects climbing proficiency, as well as plasticity in circadian rhythms and sleep. Furthermore, electrophysiological assessment of synaptic properties at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) reveals increased spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion and reduced paired pulse facilitation in <i>Sap47</i> and <i>synapsin</i> single and double mutants. Our results imply that Sap47 and synapsin cooperate non-uniformly in the control of synaptic properties in different behaviourally relevant neuronal networks of the fruitfly.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019.

To address this, we targeted an activating Hras mutation to hair follicle stem cells and discovered that Hras mutant cells outcompete wild-type neighbors yet are integrated into clinically normal skin hair follicles. In contrast, targeting the Hras mutation to the upper noncycling region of the skin epithelium leads to benign outgrowths. Follicular Hras mutant cells autonomously and nonautonomously enhance regeneration, which directs mutant cells into continuous tissue cycling to promote integration rather than aberrancy. This follicular tolerance is maintained under additional challenges that promote tumorigenesis in the epidermis, including aging, injury, and a secondary mutation. Thus, the hair follicle possesses a unique, enhanced capacity to integrate and contain Hras mutant cells within both homeostatic and perturbed tissue, demonstrating that in the skin, multiple, distinct mechanisms exist to suppress oncogenic growth.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Pineda et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

It is a policy adopted by the World Health Organization designed to operate in alignment with the United Nations (UN) framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the urgency given for the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). It particularly reflects on what, if anything, justifies protecting the most basic rights to health and well-being of older adults from possible policy trade-offs on the path to UHC.It argues that the dignity of older adults-under which are nested more specific ideas of self-respect, respect for autonomy, as well as the ethical priority for living well-underpins a categorical moral injunction against imposing the familiar utilitarian calculus as the default criterion for policy trade-offs across age groups. Respect for the dignity of older persons marks the moral threshold that every society ought to uphold even under conditions of relative resource scarcity.The moral constraint on permissible policy trade-offs relating to the health of older adults must reflect an understanding of older persons as active agents in the social structure of (their) well-being, not merely as passive vessels through which a good healthy life may or may not occur. We argue that there are three main domains where trade-offs are unacceptable from the moral point of view: it is impermissible (1) to prioritise key service(s) across different (vulnerable) age groups on the basis of actual or future contribution to society, (2) to prioritise across different age groups when co-prioritisation is warranted by the ethical theory, and (3), to always prioritise (by default) services that improve well-being over those that foster respect for dignity and autonomy.</AbstractText>"}

In summary, DEGs identified in the present study may assist clinicians in understanding the pathogenesis governing the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis, and TPM2 exhibits potential as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for atherosclerosis.</AbstractText>"}

Biophysical factors such as changes in cell size control endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and differentiation. However, the effects of aging on EC size and the mechanism by which changes in cell size control age-dependent decline in EC proliferation are largely unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that aged ECs are larger than young ECs and that age-dependent increases in EC size control EC proliferation and senescence through CDC42-Yes-associated protein (YAP1) signaling. Reduction of aged EC size by culturing on single-cell sized fibronectin-coated smaller islands decreases CDC42 activity, stimulates YAP1 nuclear translocation and attenuates EC senescence. Stimulation of YAP1 or inhibition of CDC42 activity in aged ECs also restores blood vessel formation. Age-dependent changes in EC size and/or CDC42 and YAP1 activity may be the key control point of age-related decline in angiogenesis.</AbstractText>"}

Natural ageing in the environment may change the physicochemical properties and adsorption function of biochar over the long-term. The present study compared the effects of different simulated ageing treatments on Cd adsorption of high and low temperature biochar from straw of corn (Zea mays). Fresh and aged biochars were systematically characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, XPS, Zeta, SEM-EDS, XRD and the composition of their mineral ash. The adsorption of Cd to fresh and aged biochars was then assessed under the influence of pH. Drawing the results together the effects of ageing on the extent and mode of Cd adsorption could be elucidated. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of fresh biochar produced at 650 °C was higher than of biochar made at 350 °C, and that mineral co-precipitation plays a dominant role in Cd sorption. Leaching removed organic and inorganic ash components from biochars, markedly diminishing the capacity of the high temperature biochar to adsorb Cd. The adsorption performance of the low temperature biochar was dependent on surface complexation. The adsorption capacity of low-temperature biochar was markedly enhanced by oxygen-containing functional groups formed through acidification and oxidation. The long-term benefits of biochar in the management of polluted soil require a rethink, considering the contrasting ageing behavior of different temperature biochar and their response to different ageing environments.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is well established that changes in breathing patterns and heart rate strongly influence the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal and this, in turn, can have considerable effects on fMRI studies, particularly resting-state studies. The dynamic effects of physiological processes are often quantified by using convolution models along with simultaneously recorded physiological data. In this context, physiological response function (PRF) curves (cardiac and respiratory response functions), which are convolved with the corresponding physiological fluctuations, are commonly employed. While it has often been suggested that the PRF curves may be region- or subject-specific, it is still an open question whether this is the case. In the present study, we propose a novel framework for the robust estimation of PRF curves and use this framework to rigorously examine the implications of using population-, subject-, session- and scan-specific PRF curves. The proposed framework was tested on resting-state fMRI and physiological data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results suggest that PRF curves vary significantly across subjects and, to a lesser extent, across sessions from the same subject. These differences can be partly attributed to physiological variables such as the mean and variance of the heart rate during the scan. The proposed methodological framework can be used to obtain robust scan-specific PRF curves from data records with duration longer than 5 min, exhibiting significantly improved performance compared to previously defined canonical cardiac and respiration response functions. Besides removing physiological confounds from the BOLD signal, accurate modeling of subject- (or session-/scan-) specific PRF curves is of importance in studies that involve populations with altered vascular responses, such as aging subjects.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Declining metabolic rate with age is a common future of many animals, but it is not well understood how it does so. Here, we used zebrafish as a model for understanding how metabolic changes occur during aging and the interaction between aging and obesity on the metabolic rate. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) has been used as an index of metabolic processes; however, it is difficult to accurately evaluate OCR with movement being considered because zebrafish need to move freely during the OCR measurement. To measure metabolic rate with high accuracy and efficiency, we developed a method for simultaneously collecting data on sequential oxygen consumption and distance moved by zebrafish using optical dissolved-oxygen sensors and the EthoVision video-tracking system as well as an automatic feeding system for zebrafish whereby obese zebrafish were produced by short-term overfeeding treatment. Using these systems, we examined metabolic changes during aging and overfeeding. First, we used 1- to 22-month-old zebrafish to evaluate changes in metabolism during the aging process. Measurements of body mass and length showed that the growth of the body rarely continued beyond 6 months, at which point zebrafish reach adulthood. Spontaneous swimming activity peaked at approximately 6-10 months and declined thereafter. Metabolic rates at low movement dramatically dropped during the first 4 months and gradually decreased with age after 10 months. These data suggest that metabolic aging becomes evident at approximately 10-14 months and that the metabolic rate (low movement) is useful for the detection of age-related metabolic changes in zebrafish. Second, by short-term overfeeding treatment using the automatic feeding system, we found that overweight is a strong risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders in zebrafish, but there was no interaction between obesity and aging on the metabolic rate. Therefore, our data suggest that the aging-related decline in metabolic-rate may be mostly programmed rather than being affected by energy balance disorder.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One example is the Tinnitus E-Programme, which, although freely available online, has not yet been formally evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate past, current, and new users' reactions and interactions with the Tinnitus E-Programme. Method Study 1 used an online survey to gather past and current users' reactions to, and interactions with, the intervention (<i>n</i> = 27). Study 2 used interviews and a relaxation log to assess how new users implemented the skills they learned into their everyday lives (<i>n</i> = 13). Results Generally, users expressed positive views on the intervention content and design features. Users particularly valued the education about tinnitus and its management and the relaxation skills training, and use of these components was high. In contrast, user reactions to self-monitoring tools, an online support forum, and therapist support were mixed, and use was lower. Implementation was limited by instances of poor usability and accessibility, user engagement, and adherence to relaxation goals. Users' perceptions of the intervention's credibility and relevance and beliefs regarding a negative impact on their tinnitus influenced engagement. Users in both studies identified several benefits gained, including functional and emotional management, self-efficacy for managing and coping with tinnitus, understanding tinnitus and its management, social support, and acceptance of tinnitus. Conclusion Findings suggest that the intervention was acceptable to its target group but also highlighted some areas for improvement. These findings will be used to inform further optimization work.</AbstractText>"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 26 consecutive postmenopausal women aged &gt;65 years who were admitted to our geriatric outpatient service. They were assigned to 2 groups, with (n=14) and without (n=12) low BMD based on T-score (0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that LI can predict low BMD in the femur neck with moderate accuracy (area under the curve=0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.95; P=0.031). The optimal cut-off value was 17%, with 67% specificity and 86% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that elderly women with low BMD may walk with asymmetrical trunk movement, but they are able to generate gait patterns similar to healthy peers.

The OAVs of most aroma compounds varied greatly between a rice and a wheat bread. In particular, 2-aminoacetophenone with a grape-like, medicinal aroma was characteristic for rice bread crumb and crust, while maltol was only relevant in wheat bread crust. Ehrlich pathway products varied in their concentration between the bread crumbs and were correlated with the contents of their corresponding free amino acid precursors in the flours and doughs. The analysis of rice flour revealed that only a few aroma compounds were retained in the bread. Consequently, the bread making process has a high relevance in aroma compound formation.

In the current study, trabecular bone volume measured by μCT in the femurs of CD55KO female mice was increased compared to wild type (WT). Paradoxically, osteoclast number was increased in CD55KO with no differences in osteoblast parameters. Osteoclasts from CD55KO mice exhibited abnormal actin-ring formation and reduced bone-resorbing activity. Moreover, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) treatment failed to activate Rac guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) in CD55KO bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cells. In addition, apoptotic caspases activity was enhanced in CD55KO, which led to the poor survival of mature osteoclasts.

There is growing evidence to suggest that the cells in the maculae flavae are tissue stem cells of the human vocal fold and maculae flavae are a candidate for a stem cell niche. 2. The latest research shows that the cells in the human maculae flavae are involved in the metabolism of extracellular matrices that are essential for viscoelasticity in the human vocal fold mucosa as a vibrating tissue and are considered to be important cells in the growth, development, and aging of the human vocal fold mucosa. 3. Recent evidence has indicated that the cells including vocal fold stellate cells in the maculae flavae of the human vocal fold mucosa are a functionally heterogenous population. 4. The cells in the human maculae flavae possess proteins of all three germ layers, indicating that they are undifferentiated and have the ability of multipotency. 5. The cell division in the human adult maculae flavae is reflective of asymmetric self-renewal, and cultured cells form a colony-forming unit. Therefore, the phenomenon gives rise to the strong possibility that the cells in the human maculae flavae are putative stem cells. 6. Recent research has suggested that the cells in the human maculae flavae arise from the differentiation of bone marrow cells via peripheral circulation. 7. Cultured cell populations in the human maculae flavae are roughly divided into three groups by morphological features: cobblestone-like polygonal cells, vocal fold stellate cell-like cells, and fibroblast-like spindle cells. However, at the present state of our investigation, it is difficult to clarify the stem cell system and hierarchy of stem cells in the human maculae flavae. 8.

Population-based studies demonstrate an increased incidence, especially among elderly patients. Controversy exists regarding whether presentation of BSI are different in older patients compared to younger patients; our narrative review of the literature suggests that BSI in elderly patients would probably include one or more of the traditional symptoms/signs of fever, severe sepsis or septic shock, acute kidney injury, and/or leukocytosis. Sources of BSI in older adults are most commonly the urinary tract (more so than in younger adults) and the respiratory tract. Gram-negative bacteria are the most common isolates in the old (~ 40-60% of BSI); isolates from the elderly patient population show higher antibiotic resistance rates, with long-term care facilities serving as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria. BSI entail significantly higher rates of mortality in older age, both short and long term. Some of the risk factors for mortality are modifiable, such as the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy and nosocomial acquisition of infection. Health-related quality of life issues regarding the elderly patient with BSI are not well addressed in the literature. Utilization of comprehensive geriatric assessment and comprehensive geriatric discharge planning need to be investigated further in this setting and might serve as key for improved results in this population.

Elevated Neuroticism scores were associated with higher tau-PET accumulation in the amygdala (p = .002), entorhinal cortex (p = .012), and inferior temporal cortex (p = .016), as well as with a composite tau-PET measure (p = .002). In contrast, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were not associated with tau deposition in any of these regions (p's &gt; 0.160). Our results indicate that increased Neuroticism is associated with higher tau pathophysiology in regions known to be vulnerable to AD pathophysiology in CN participants. High Neuroticism scores may therefore serve as a potential risk factor for tau accumulation. Alternatively, personality can change with the onset of AD, thus increased tau levels may affect Neuroticism scores. While future longitudinal studies are needed to determine directionality, our findings suggest early associations between Neuroticism and tau accumulation in CN adults.</AbstractText>"}

Our study objective was to gain insights into how a potential Mobile Health Obesity Wellness Intervention (MOWI) in rural older adults with obesity, consisting of nutrition and exercise sessions, could be helpful to improve physical function. A qualitative methods study was conducted in a rural community, community-based aging center. Four community leaders, 7 clinicians and 29 patient participants underwent focus groups and semi-structured interviews. All participants had a favorable view of MOWI and saw its potential to improve health and create accountability. Participants noted that MOWI could overcome geographic barriers and provided feedback about components that could improve implementation. There was expressed enthusiasm over its potential to improve health. The use of technology in older adults with obesity in rural areas has considerable promise. There is potential that this intervention could potentially extend to distant areas in rural America that can surmount accessibility barriers. If successful, this intervention could potentially alter healthcare delivery by enhancing health promotion in a remote, geographically constrained communities. MOWI has the potential to reach older adults with obesity using novel methods in geographically isolated regions.</AbstractText>"}

Meanwhile, late-onset asthma is a major comorbid condition in patients with CRSwNP; they frequently present with type 2 inflammatory signatures that are refractory to conventional treatments when they are comorbid. However, as they are more commonly non-atopic, causative factors other than classical atopic sensitization, such as Staphylococcus aureus specific IgE sensitization, are suggested to drive the type 2 inflammation. There are additional comorbidity associations in older patients with CRSwNP, including those with chronic otitis media and head and neck malignancy. Age is a major determinant for the incidence and clinical presentations of CRSwNP.

Yet, few studies have examined the effectiveness of ACP interventions among African Americans. The objectives of reducing disparities in the quality of palliative care for older African Americans through improved advance care planning (EQUAL ACP) are as follows: to compare the effectiveness of two interventions in (1) increasing ACP among African Americans and whites and (2) reducing racial disparities in both ACP and end-of-life care; and to examine whether racial concordance of the interventionist and patient is associated with ACP. EQUAL ACP <b>i</b>s a longitudinal, multisite, cluster randomized trial and a qualitative study describing the ACP experience of participants.

Eligible patients have a serious illness (advanced cancer, heart failure, lung disease, etc.), disability in activities of daily living, or recent hospitalization. Patients are followed for one year and participate in either a patient-guided, self-management ACP approach, including a Five Wishes form or structured ACP with Respecting Choices First Steps. The primary outcome is formal or informal ACP-completion of advance directives, documented discussions with clinicians, and other written or verbal communication with surrogate decision makers about care preferences.

The large variability observed in the onset and progression of COPD is primarily driven by complex gene-environment interactions. The transcriptomic and epigenetic memory potential of lung epithelial and innate immune cells drive responses, such as mucus hyperreactivity and airway remodeling, that are tightly regulated by various molecular mechanisms, for which several candidate susceptibility genes have been described. However, the recently described noncoding RNA species, in particular the long noncoding RNAs, may also have an important role in modulating pulmonary responses to chronic inhalation of toxic substances and the development of COPD. This review outlines the features of long noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in regulating the airway inflammatory responses to cigarette smoke exposure and their possible association with COPD pathogenesis. As COPD continues to debilitate the increasingly aging population and contribute to higher morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, the search for better biomarkers and alternative therapeutic options is pivotal.</AbstractText>"}

A total of 15 healthy volunteers were grouped according to age, with 5 people in each of the following groups: young group (25-45 years), middle-aged group (46-65 years), and old-aged group (&gt; 65 years). In the TEM micrographs, the internal components, specifically the α-granules, dense granules, and lysosomal granules, of 20 platelets were counted for each group. Two-way analysis of variance of age and sex variance was used to compare the results. The ultrastructure of the platelets in the old-aged group was observed to be quite different from those of the young and middle-aged groups. Specifically, with ageing, the platelet membrane becomes more irregular in shape and non-smooth, and multiple platelet membrane ruptures are observed. Furthermore, the pseudopodia and protuberances become more numerous and slender, and the number of α-granules is significantly reduced. These morphological changes indicate that ageing may affect the function of platelets, which in turn affects the efficacy of platelet concentrates. Thus, the effects of age should be considered when using platelet concentrates prepared from elderly autologous blood.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Medicalhelplines.com Inc and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In the present study, we investigated the influence and underlying mechanisms of KAE supplementation on porcine oocytes during in vitro aging. The results show that KAE treatment can alleviate the aging-related reduction of developmental competence. We observed that the blastocyst production rate in aged oocytes treated with 0.1 μM KAE was significantly higher than in untreated aging oocytes (36.78 ± 0.86% vs. 27.55 ± 2.60%, respectively, p &lt; .05). The KAE-treated aging oocytes had significantly reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (p &lt; .05). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of the embryonic pluripotency-related genes Oct4, NANOG, and ITGA5 were significantly increased in blastocysts derived from KAE-treated oocytes (p &lt; .05). During excessive oocyte culture, KAE treatment maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced apoptosis; however, this was not observed in untreated aging oocytes. In conclusion, our results suggest that KAE treatment can alleviate the aging of porcine oocytes by reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</CopyrightInformation>"}

This disease is a consequence of the complex interaction of microbial agents, with environmental and host factors, resulting in the dysregulation of multiple oncogenic and tumor-suppressing signaling pathways. Despite the advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis, there are still reduced therapeutic options for patients with gastric cancer. In recent years, genomic analyses of gastric tumors have emphasized their molecular heterogeneity. The distinction of gastric cancer molecular subtypes may be a key to identify novel therapeutic targets, to predict patient outcome and response to therapy, and to guide early diagnosis strategies. In this review, we summarize the most recent updates on the relationship between microbial agents and gastric cancer, in particular, Helicobacter pylori, the non-H pylori microbiome, and Epstein-Barr virus. We also highlight the main advances made in the past year regarding the molecular characterization of gastric cancer, especially the signatures with potential clinical utility.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Our results show that ethanol extracts of CU (EECU) inhibited cell growth and increased the apoptotic cells in B16F10 cells. EECU also stimulated the induction of mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway, with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, EECU suppressed the migration, invasion, and colony formation of B16F10 cells. In addition, the oral administration of EECU reduced serum lactate dehydrogenase activity without weight loss, hepatotoxicity, nor nephrotoxicity in B16F10 cell-inoculated mice. Moreover, EECU markedly suppressed lung hypertrophy, the number and expression of metastatic tumor nodules, and the expression of inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha in lung tissue.

GH and IGF-1 levels are markedly reduced in older humans, leading some to hypothesize GH supplementation could be a viable 'anti-aging' therapy. However, there is still much debate over the benefits and risks of GH administration. While an early study of GH administration reported reduced adiposity and lipid levels and increased bone mineral density, subsequent studies failed to show significant benefits. Conversely, other studies found positive effects of GH deficiency including extended life span, improved cognitive function, resistance to diseases such as cancer and diabetes, and improved insulin sensitivity despite a higher fat percentage. Thus, the roles of GH in aging and cognition remain unclear, and there is currently not enough evidence to support use of GH as an anti-aging or cognitive impairment therapy.

Multiple regression controlling for age, education, satisfaction with sex life, cohabiting, wealth, general health, physical activity, depression, and loneliness was used to explore the associations between the frequency of engagement in intercourse, masturbation, and kissing/petting/fondling, and two measures of cognitive function: word recall and number sequencing.

Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are known to have extraribosomal functions, including developmental regulation and stress responses; however, the effects of RPs on symbiotic nodulation of legumes are still unclear. Ribosomal protein 22 of the large 60S subunit (RPL22), a non-typical RP that is only found in eukaryotes, has been shown to function as a tumour suppressor in animals. Here, a homologue of RPL22, Rpf84, was identified from the leguminous tree R. pseudoacacia. Subcellular localization assays showed that Rpf84 was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Knockdown of Rpf84 by RNA interference (RNAi) technology impaired the infection process and nodule development. Compared with the control, root and stem length, dry weight and nodule number per plant were drastically decreased in Rpf84-RNAi plants. The numbers of root hair curlings, infection threads and nodule primordia were also significantly reduced. Ultrastructure analyses showed that Rpf84-RNAi nodules contained fewer infected cells with fewer bacteria. In particular, remarkable deformation of bacteroids and fusion of multiple symbiosomes occurred in infected cells. By contrast, overexpression of Rpf84 promoted nodulation, and the overexpression nodules maintained a larger infection/differentiation region and had more infected cells filled with bacteroids than the control at 45 days post inoculation, suggesting a retarded ageing process in nodules. These results indicate for the first time that RP regulates the symbiotic nodulation of legumes and that RPL22 may function in initiating the invasion of rhizobia and preventing bacteroids from degradation in R. pseudoacacia.</AbstractText>"}

Current treatments rely upon donor allogeneic tissue to replace the damaged CE. A donor cornea shortage necessitates the development of biomaterials, enabling in vitro expansion of corneal endothelial cells (CECs). This study investigated the use of a synthetic peptide hydrogel using poly-ε-lysine (pεK), cross-linked with octanedioic-acid as a potential substrate for CECs expansion and CE grafts. PεK hydrogel properties were optimised to produce a substrate which was thin, transparent, porous and robust. A human corneal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) attached and grew on pεK hydrogels as confluent monolayers after 7 days, whereas primary porcine CECs (pCECs) detached from the pεK hydrogel. Pre-adsorption of collagen I, collagen IV and fibronectin to the pεK hydrogel increased pCEC adhesion at 24 h and confluent monolayers formed at 7 days. Minimal cell adhesion was observed with pre-adsorbed laminin, chondroitin sulphate or commercial FNC coating mix (fibronectin, collagen and albumin). Functionalisation of the pεK hydrogel with synthetic cell binding peptide H-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly-Gly-OH (RGD) or α2β1 integrin recognition sequence H-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala-OH (DGEA) resulted in enhanced pCEC adhesion with the RGD peptide only. pCECs grown in culture at 5 weeks on RGD pεK hydrogels showed zonula occludins 1 staining for tight junctions and expression of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphase, suggesting a functional CE. These results demonstrate the pεK hydrogel can be tailored through covalent binding of RGD to provide a surface for CEC attachment and growth. Thus, providing a synthetic substrate with a therapeutic application for the expansion of allogenic CECs and replacement of damaged CE.</AbstractText>"}

However, different drying processes of sediment pretreatment could change metal geochemical fractions, especially for Hg, which is potentially volatile. In this study, the influence of pretreatment methods including oven-drying, air-drying, freeze-drying, and fresh sediments on the analysis of Hg fractions in sediments was investigated. Results showed that remarkable differences of Hg concentration were observed between fresh sediments and dried pretreatment sediments (P &lt; 0.05). Briefly, the concentrations of the water-soluble and human stomach acid-soluble fractions in oven-dried and air-dried sediments generally showed significant increasing trends compared with those in the fresh sediments, while the organo-chelated fraction exhibited significant decreasing trends. The cause of this phenomenon was primarily the oxidation of organic matter, aging process, and the diffusion of Hg into micropores. The significant loss was also observed at elemental Hg fraction due to its volatilization effect. The freeze-drying posed minor influence on changes of Hg fraction analysis compared with oven-drying and air-drying. Moreover, the total Hg concentrations in pretreated sediments showed a decline of varying degrees compared with those in fresh sediments ascribing to the volatilization of elemental Hg. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed that freeze-drying could minimize the errors of the Hg fraction analysis in sediments.</AbstractText>"}

It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. CI oxidizes NADH generated from the tricarboxylic acid cycle to NAD<sup>+</sup>, in a series of redox reactions that culminates in the reduction of ubiquinone, and the transport of protons from the matrix across the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The resulting proton-motive force is consumed by ATP synthase to generate ATP, or harnessed to transport ions, metabolites and proteins into the mitochondrion. CI is also a major source of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, impaired CI function has been associated with a host of chronic metabolic and degenerative disorders such as diabetes, cardiomyopathy, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Leigh syndrome. Studies on Drosophila have contributed to our understanding of the multiple roles of CI in bioenergetics and organismal physiology.

Environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle factors, affect the rate of telomere shortening which can be reversed by telomerase. Telomerase activation by natural molecules has been suggested to be an anti‑aging modulator that can play a role in the treatment of aging‑related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of natural compounds on telomerase activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The tested compounds included Centella asiatica extract formulation (08AGTLF), Astragalus extract formulation (Nutrient 4), TA‑65 (containing Astragalus membranaceus extract), oleanolic acid (OA), maslinic acid (MA), and 3 multi‑nutrient formulas (Nutrients 1, 2 and 3) at various concentrations. The mean absorbance values of telomerase activity measured following treatment with some of the above‑mentioned formulations were statistically significantly higher compared to those of the untreated cells. In particular, in order of importance with respect to telomerase activation from highest to lowest, 08AGTLF, OA, Nutrient 4, TA‑65, MA, Nutrient 3 and Nutrient 2, triggered statistically significant increase in telomerase activity compared to the untreated cells. 08AGTLF reached the highest levels of telomerase activity reported to date, at least to our knowledge, increasing telomerase activity by 8.8 folds compared to untreated cells, while Nutrient 4 and OA were also potent activators (4.3‑fold and 5.9‑fold increase, respectively). On the whole, this study indicates that the synergistic effect of nutrients and natural compounds can activate telomerase and produce more potent formulations. Human clinical studies using these formulations are required to evaluate their mode of action. This would reveal the health benefits of telomerase activation through natural molecules and would shed new light onto the treatment of aging‑related diseases.</AbstractText>"}

Notably, robust self-renewal of adult GSCs delays reproductive aging and is required for extended lifespan at cold temperatures. These cells release prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to induce <i>cbs-1</i> expression in the intestine, increasing somatic production of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a gaseous signaling molecule that prolongs lifespan. Whereas loss of adult GSCs reduces intestinal <i>cbs-1</i> expression and cold-induced longevity, application of exogenous PGE2 rescues these phenotypes. Importantly, tissue-specific intestinal overexpression of <i>cbs-1</i> mimics cold-temperature conditions and extends longevity even at warm temperatures.

Alleviating the extent of oxidative damage is therefore considered as a potential way to promote longevity. SFPS, a heteropolysaccharide extracted from the brown alga <i>Sargassum fusiforme</i>, has previously been shown to alleviate oxidative damage during the aging process in mice, but whether SFPS could extend the lifespan of an organism was not demonstrated. Furthermore, the precise component within SFPS that is responsible for the antioxidant activity and the underlying mechanism of such activity was also not resolved. In this study, SP2, a fucoidan derived from SFPS, was shown to exhibit strong antioxidant activity as measured by <i>in vitro</i> radical-scavenging assays. SP2 also improved the survival rate of <i>D. melanogaster</i> subjected to oxidative stress. The flies that were fed with a diet containing SP2 from the time of eclosion displayed significant enhancement in lifespan and reduced accumulation of triglyceride at the old-age stage. In addition, SP2 markedly improved the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and reduced the contents of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in old flies. Furthermore, SP2 also upregulated the expression levels of the <i>nuclear factor-erythroid-2-like 2</i> (<i>nfe2l2 or nrf2</i>) and its downstream target genes, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the expression of <i>kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1</i> (<i>keap1</i>, a canonical inhibitor of the Nrf2) in old flies. Additional support linking the crucial role of the Nrf2/ARE pathway to the antioxidant effect of SP2 was the relatively high survival rate under heat stress for <i>D. melanogaster</i> individuals receiving SP2 supplement, an effect that was abolished by the inclusion of inhibitors specific for the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Collectively, the results indicated that SP2, a <i>S. fusiforme</i> fucoidan, could promote longevity in <i>D. melanogaster</i> by enhancing the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant signaling pathway during the aging process.</AbstractText>"}

The oxidative stress theory has been confirmed in many animal studies, which demonstrated that the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and biomolecular stability and integrity is crucial for cellular longevity and successful aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network, alteration in the activities of transcription factors such as Nrf2 and NF-<i>κ</i>B, and disturbances in the protein quality control machinery that includes molecular chaperones, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and autophagy/lysosome pathway have been observed during aging and age-related chronic diseases. The accumulation of ROS under oxidative stress conditions results in the induction of lipid peroxidation and glycoxidation reactions, which leads to the elevated endogenous production of reactive aldehydes and their derivatives such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal (MG), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) giving rise to advanced lipoxidation and glycation end products (ALEs and AGEs, respectively). Both ALEs and AGEs play key roles in cellular response to oxidative stress stimuli through the regulation of a variety of cell signaling pathways. However, elevated ALE and AGE production leads to protein cross-linking and aggregation resulting in an alteration in cell signaling and functioning which causes cell damage and death. This is implicated in aging and various age-related chronic pathologies such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, and vascular complications of diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we discuss experimental data evidencing the impairment in cellular functions caused by AGE/ALE accumulation under oxidative stress conditions. We focused on the implications of ALEs/AGEs in aging and age-related diseases to demonstrate that the identification of cellular dysfunctions involved in disease initiation and progression can serve as a basis for the discovery of relevant therapeutic agents.</AbstractText>"}

These results suggest that IBS can be useful to measure the effects of social-bonding facilitation activities for educational communication.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we report that light can also trigger sequence variations in abiotic information-containing polymers. Sequence-coded poly(phosphodiester)s were synthesized using four phosphoramidite monomers containing either photo-sensitive or photo-inert substituents. These monomers allow different sequence manipulations. For instance, using two light-cleavable monomers containing o-nitrobenzyl ether and o-nitroveratryl ether motifs, photo-erasable digital polymers were prepared. These polymers can be decoded by tandem mass spectrometry but become unreadable after UVA exposure. The opposite behavior, i.e. photo-revealable sequences, was obtained with polymers made of two isobaric monomers containing light-cleavable o-nitrobenzyl ether and light-inert p-nitrobenzyl ether substituents. Furthermore, when the latter two monomers were used in conjunction with a third monomer bearing a light-inert OH group, site-directed photo-mutations were induced in synthetic polymers. This was used herein to change the meaning of binary sequences.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we report evidence from mouse and human studies that this goal can be achieved by maintaining optimal hydration throughout life. We demonstrate that restricting the amount of drinking water shortens mouse lifespan with no major warning signs up to 14 months of life, followed by sharp deterioration. Mechanistically, water restriction yields stable metabolism remodeling toward metabolic water production with greater food intake and energy expenditure, an elevation of markers of inflammation and coagulation, accelerated decline of neuromuscular coordination, renal glomerular injury, and the development of cardiac fibrosis. In humans, analysis of data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study revealed that hydration level, assessed at middle age by serum sodium concentration, is associated with markers of coagulation and inflammation and predicts the development of many age-related degenerative diseases 24 years later. The analysis estimates that improving hydration throughout life may greatly decrease the prevalence of degenerative diseases, with the most profound effect on dementia, heart failure (HF), and chronic lung disease (CLD), translating to the development of these diseases in 3 million fewer people in the United States alone.</AbstractText>"}

Here, we determined whether EPO levels correlate with the incidence of different dementia subtypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and unspecified dementia (UnD), and whether such associations vary with annual cumulatively defined daily doses (DDDs) of EPO for ESRD patients receiving HD. This retrospective study included data from 43,906 adult ESRD patients who received HD between 1999 and 2010. Using hazard ratios and Cox regression models, we found that patients receiving EPO had a 39% lower risk of general dementia than those in the non-EPO group. Similarly, the risks of VaD and UnD was lower for patients in the EPO cohort. The risk of dementia was further reduced in HD patients treated with EPO in combination with iron.

Proteolytic degradation of cartilage glycoproteins can contribute to the loss of matrix integrity. Human inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), which stabilizes the extracellular matrix, is composed of the light-chain serine proteinase inhibitor bikunin and two homologous heavy chains (HC1 and HC2) covalently linked through chondroitin 4-sulfate. Inflammation promotes the transfer of HCs from chondroitin 4-sulfate to hyaluronan by tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6). This reaction generates a covalent complex between the heavy chains and hyaluronan that can promote leukocyte invasion. This study demonstrates that both IαI and the HC-hyaluronan complex are substrates for the extracellular matrix proteases ADAMTS-5 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) -3, -7, and -13. The major cleavage sites for all four proteases are found in the C terminus of HC2. ADAMTS-5 and MMP-7 displayed the highest activity toward HC2. ADAMTS-5 degradation products were identified in mass spectrometric analysis of 29 of 33 arthropathic patients, indicating that ADAMTS-5 cleavage occurs in synovial fluid in arthritis. After cleavage, free HC2, together with TSG-6, is able to catalyze the transfer of heavy chains to hyaluronan. The release of extracellular matrix bound HC2 is likely to increase the mobility of the HC2/TSG-6 catalytic unit and consequently increase the rate of the HC transfer reaction. Ultimately, ADAMTS-5 cleavage of HC2 could alter the physiological and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix and contribute to the progression of arthritis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Scavenius et al.</CopyrightInformation>"}

In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> loss of PIWI-interacting RNA pathway components, including Vasa, causes Chk2-dependent oogenesis arrest. However, whether the arrest is due to Chk2 signaling at a specific stage and whether continuous Chk2 signaling is required for the arrest is unknown. Here, we show that absence of Vasa during the germarial stages causes Chk2-dependent oogenesis arrest. Additionally, we report the age-dependent decline of the ovariole number both in flies lacking Vasa expression only in the germarium and in loss-of-function <i><i>vas</i>a</i> mutant flies. We show that Chk2 activation exclusively in the germarium is sufficient to interrupt oogenesis and to reduce ovariole number in aging flies. Once induced in the germarium, Chk2-mediated arrest of germ cell development cannot be overcome by restoration of Vasa or by downregulation of Chk2 in the arrested egg chambers. These findings, together with the identity of Vasa-associated proteins identified in this study, demonstrate an essential role of the helicase in the germ cell lineage maintenance and indicate a function of Vasa in germline stem cell homeostasis.</AbstractText>   <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Durdevic and Ephrussi.</CopyrightInformation>"}

Results showed that HMB supplementation in addition to physical exercise has no or fairly low impact in improving body composition, muscle strength, or physical performance in adults aged 50 to 80 years, compared to exercise alone. There is a gap of knowledge on the beneficial effects of HMB combined with exercise to preserve cognitive functions in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Future RCTs are needed to refine treatment choices combining HMB and exercises for older people in particular populations, ages, and health status. Specifically, interventions in older adults aged 80 years or older, with cognitive impairment, frailty, or limited mobility are required.</AbstractText>"}

The importance of circadian expression for structure, function and metabolism of skeletal muscle is clear when observing the muscle phenotype in models of molecular clock disruption. Presently, the maintenance of circadian rhythms is emerging as an important new factor in human health, with disruptions linked to ageing, as well as to the development of many chronic diseases, including sarcopenia. Therefore, the aim of this review is to present the latest findings demonstrating how circadian rhythms in skeletal muscle are important for maintenance of the cellular physiology, metabolism and function of skeletal muscle. Moreover, we will present the current knowledge about the tissue-specific functions of the molecular clock in skeletal muscle.</AbstractText>"}

The aim of this research is to develop a methodology to include non-contact vibration monitoring as part of structural health monitoring of concrete dams. We have performed in-situ structural vibration measurements on the run-of-the-river Brežice dam in Slovenia during the start-up tests and regular operation. In recent decades, the rapid development of laser measurement technology has provided powerful methods for a variety of measuring tasks. Despite these recent developments, the use of lasers for measuring has been limited to sites provided with stationary conditions. This paper explains the elimination of pseudo-vibration and measurement noise inherent in the non-stationary conditions of the site. Upon removal of the noise, fatigue of the different structural elements of the powerhouse could be identified if significant changes over time are observed in the eigenfrequencies. The use of laser technology is to complement the regular monitoring activities on large dams, since observation and analysis of integrity parameters provide indispensable information for decision making and maintaining good structural health of ageing dams.</AbstractText>"}

The majority of current successful ageing models, however, represent rather a prevailing construct in Western societies. Physical and psychosocial well-being and the ability to adjust to the ideals of successful ageing are often seen as an integral part of a good quality in life. Those who do not or cannot follow these lines are often regarded as morally irresponsible and seem to be doomed to have a lonely, unhealthy and unhappy later life. This paper questions the current discourses of successful ageing in terms of healthy and happy living and calls for a reconsideration of more global, integrated and holistic understandings of the process of growing old.</AbstractText>"}

Although they are frequently depicted as static bean-shaped structures, our view has markedly changed over the past few decades as many studies have revealed a remarkable dynamicity of mitochondrial shapes and sizes both at the cellular and intra-mitochondrial levels. Aberrant changes in mitochondrial dynamics and cristae structure are associated with ageing and numerous human diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, various neurodegenerative diseases, types of neuro- and myopathies). Another unique feature of mitochondria is that they harbor their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MtDNA exists in several hundreds to thousands of copies per cell and is arranged and packaged in the mitochondrial matrix in structures termed mt-nucleoids. Many human diseases are mechanistically linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and alteration of the number and/or the integrity of mtDNA. In particular, several recent studies identified remarkable and partly unexpected links between mitochondrial structure, fusion and fission dynamics, and mtDNA. In this review, we will provide an overview about these recent insights and aim to clarify how mitochondrial dynamics, cristae ultrastructure and mtDNA structure influence each other and determine mitochondrial functions.</AbstractText>"}

The development of such tools could enable therapeutic interventions earlier in the disease course and thus potentially reducing the debilitating effects of AD. Glycosylation is a common, and important, post translational modification of proteins implicated in a host of disease states resulting in a complex array of glycans being incorporated into biomolecules. Recent investigations of glycan profiles, in a wide range of conditions, has been made possible due to technological advances in the field enabling accurate glycoanalyses. Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, tau protein, and other important proteins involved in AD pathogenesis, have altered glycosylation profiles. Crucially, these abnormalities present early in the disease state, are present in the peripheral blood, and help to distinguish AD from other dementias. This review describes the aberrant glycome in AD, focusing on proteins implicated in development and progression, and elucidates the potential of glycome aberrations as early stage biomarkers of AD.</AbstractText>"}

Since experimental and smaller human studies suggest that diet, physical activity, and body weight may all affect coagulation, we evaluated associations between these lifestyle factors and hemostatic biomarkers in a population-based study. Cross-sectional baseline data from 2267 randomly selected participants of EPIC-Heidelberg (age range 35-65 years) was used. Fibrinogen, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, P-selectin, thrombomodulin (TM), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were measured in baseline plasma samples. A score reflecting adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) recommendations for cancer prevention was created. Associations between the WCRF/AICR score as well as its individual components and hemostatic biomarkers were analyzed by linear regression models. Multivariable-adjusted geometric means (95% confidence intervals) of TM and TPO were higher with greater adherence to the WCRF/AICR recommendations (TM, lowest vs. highest score category: 2.90 (2.7,3.1) vs. 3.10 (2.9,3.3) ng/mL, <i>p</i><sub>linear trend</sub> = 0.0001; TPO: 328 (302,356) vs. 348 (321,378) pg/mL, <i>p</i><sub>linear trend</sub> = 0.0007). These associations were driven by lower alcohol and meat consumption among persons with higher WCRF/AICR scores. Our results indicate that lifestyle factors favorably affect TM and TPO, two hemostatic factors implicated in chronic disease development.</AbstractText>"}

Notably, diet and lifestyle have a strong influence on BP. We investigated the association between dietary factors and BP in older adults. This cross-sectional study included 128 participants, aged 65-80 years. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine the associations between diet, including meats, vegetables, grains, fruits, dairy, fats, and added sugar, and BP. There was a significant association between intake of added sugar and systolic BP and diastolic BP in females after controlling for age, income, body mass index, physical activity levels, daily calorie intake, and BP medication use. The model predicted that a decrease of 2.3 teaspoons (0.5 standard deviation) of added sugar would result in a 8.4 mmHg drop in systolic BP and a 3.7 mmHg drop in diastolic BP. Whole fruit was associated with a reduction in diastolic BP in both males and females, and the model predicted that, for every 0.71 cup increase in whole fruit consumption, there would be a decrease in diastolic BP of 2.8 mmHg. Our findings support the dietary guidelines of limiting daily intake of added sugar and increasing fruit consumption to promote overall cardiovascular health in older adults.</AbstractText>"}

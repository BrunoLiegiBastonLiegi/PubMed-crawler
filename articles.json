The study was conducted with 90 physicians and 2602 of their patients on medications treating chronic illness. In this cluster randomized controlled trial, physicians were randomly assigned to an arm where the physician receives notification of patient nonadherence derived from real-time claims data, an arm where they receive this information and a pharmacist may contact patients either by default or by physician choice, and a control group. The primary outcome was resolving nonadherence within 30 days. We also considered physician engagement outcomes including viewing information about nonadherence and utilizing a pharmacist. Physician engagement was constructed from metadata from the study website; adherence outcomes were constructed from medication claims. We see no differences between the treatment arms and control for the primary adherence outcome. The pharmacist intervention was 42 percentage points (95% CI: 28 pp-56 pp) more likely when it was triggered by default. Access to a pharmacist and real-time nonadherence information did not improve patient adherence.

However, it remains unknown how nicotine induces podocyte injury. The present study tested whether nicotine induces NLRP3 inflammasomes activation and thereby contributes to podocyte injury. Nicotine treatment significantly increased the colocalization of NLRP3 with Asc, caspase-1 activity, IL-β production, cell permeability in podocytes compared to control cells. Pretreatment with caspase-1 inhibitor, WEHD significantly abolished the nicotine-induced colocalization of NLRP3 with Asc, caspase-1 activity, IL-1β production and cell permeability in podocytes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that nicotine treatment significantly decreased the podocin and nephrin expression compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with WEHD attenuated the nicotine-induced podocin and nephrin reduction. In addition, we found that nicotine treatment significantly increased the O2.- production compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with WEHD did not alter the nicotine-induced O2.- production. Furthermore, prior treatment with ROS scavenger, NAC significantly attenuated the nicotine-induced caspase-1 activity, IL-1β production, podocin and nephrin reduction in podocytes. Nicotine-induced the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in podocytes and thereby results in podocyte injury. Inflammasome formation and immunofluorescence expressions were quantified by confocal microscopy. Caspase-1 activity, IL-1β production and O2.- production were measured by ELISA and ESR. "}

{"PMID":31835241,"Title":"Do Older Adults With Reduced Bone Mineral Density Benefit From Strength Training? A Critically Appraised Topic.","Abstract":" Clinical Scenario: Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is a serious condition in older adults. The mild form, osteopenia, is often a precursor of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a pathological condition and a global health problem as it is one of the most common diseases in developed countries. Finding solutions for prevention and therapy should be prioritized. Therefore, the critically appraised topic focuses on strength training as a treatment to counteract a further decline in BMD in older adults. Clinical Question: Is strength training beneficial in increasing BMD in older people with osteopenia or osteoporosis? Summary of Key Findings: Four of the 5 reviewed studies with the highest evidence showed a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD after strength training interventions in comparison with control groups. The fifth study confirmed the maintenance of lumbar spine density due to conducted exercises. Moreover, 3 reviewed studies revealed increasing BMD at the femoral neck after strength training when compared with controls, which appeared significant in 2 of them. Clinical Bottom Line: The findings indicate that strength training has a significant positive influence on BMD in older women (ie, postmenopausal) with osteoporosis or osteopenia. However, it is not recommended to only rely on strength training as the increase of BMD may not appear fast enough to reach the minimal desired values. A combination of strength training and supplements/medication seems most adequate. Generalization of the findings to older men with reduced BMD should be done with caution due to the lack of studies. Strength of Recommendation: There is grade B of recommendation to support the validity of strength training for older women in postmenopausal phase with reduced BMD. "}

While some strategies, such as cognitive training, exercise or socio-intellectual engagement, appear beneficial, few studies have examined the association between personality and intervention efficacy. A systematic review was therefore conducted to summarise and synthesise the literature regarding the influence of personality traits on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive ageing. A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science was carried out. Of the 2100 papers identified by the search strategy, 10 studies were retained that met the relevant criteria (e.g., intervention studies with one or more cognitive outcomes and a measure of personality). Of these, two studies reported that higher levels of Openness to Experience were associated with greater improvement in memory performance after cognitive training interventions. Another found a positive association between Openness and improvement in divergent thinking following a novel group-based problem solving programme. One social intervention study reported positive moderating effects of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and mixed effects of Extraversion. Mixed evidence was also found regarding Need for Cognition, with one study reporting a positive association with memory improvement and another reporting less improvement in divergent thinking. Others found no evidence of personality influencing intervention outcomes. Due to the relatively small and heterogeneous sample of studies identified, any conclusions should currently be considered preliminary. These findings highlight the need for further research exploring the role of personality in intervention efficacy, so that interventions might be better tailored to individuals.

HIF-signaling is central to many human diseases and mediates longevity in the nematode. Despite the rapidly increasing knowledge on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), little is known about their contribution to hypoxia-induced cellular adaptation. We used RNA interactome capture (RIC) in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and vhl-1 loss-of-function mutants to fill this gap. This approach identifies more than 1,300 nematode RBPs, 270 of which can be considered novel RBPs. Interestingly, loss of vhl-1 modulates the RBPome. This difference is not primarily explained by protein abundance suggesting differential RNA-binding. Taken together, our study provides a global view on the nematode RBPome and proteome as well as their modulation by HIF-signaling.

{"PMID":31835162,"Title":"Structural correlates of commission errors in prospective memory.","Abstract":" Prospective memory refers to remembering to perform an intended future action, such as remembering to take medication with breakfast. Historically, the field has focused on failures to initially remember a prospective memory task (omission errors), but interestingly, individuals will occasionally repeat a prospective memory action after it has been completed (e.g., double dosing). These failures in prospective memory deactivation/forgetting are termed commission errors. The current registered study investigated structural neuroimaging correlates of a laboratory measure of commission errors in 47 healthy older adults. Extant theories differed in their predicted outcomes: commission error risk was predicted to be highest in individuals with smaller medial temporal lobe volume (output monitoring theory), larger lateral prefrontal cortex volume (residual activation theory), or a combination of larger medial temporal lobe volume and smaller lateral prefrontal cortex volume (dual mechanisms theory). In registered analyses, we found that a higher number of commission errors was associated with larger medial temporal lobe/hippocampal grey matter volume (supporting dual mechanisms theory), but not with grey or white matter volume in the lateral parietal lobe, frontal pole, or a composite of ventrolateral/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (not supporting dual mechanisms theory). In post hoc analyses, smaller volume in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was associated with a higher number of commission errors, possibly indicating that the dual mechanisms theory of PFC control was conceptually correct, but that a different PFC subregion than anticipated exerts control over commission errors. Collectively, the registered and post hoc analysis findings showed a functional dissociation across MTL/PFC regions that was more consistent with the dual mechanisms theory than the alternative theories.

With more elderly people in the future, the demand for hip replacements will increase and put additional constraints on hospital services. The objective was to explore the future need for hip replacements and related costs and to investigate if anticipated future efficiency gains might alleviate the strain of increased demand. Registry-based modelling study. Data were obtained from the Irish Central Statistics Office and the national Hospital Inpatient Enquiry system for 2011-2017. We estimated the future demand for hip replacements each year until 2051 and analysed changes in hip replacement rates and the average length of stay. These assumptions were used in our projections. Assuming no change in procedure rates, the annual cost of providing elective hip replacements is expected to increase by 1060 (30%) episodes in 2026 which implies a cost increment of €16M (33%) (vs 2017-level). If the historical increase in the procedure rate is assumed, the cost will increase by €33M (67%). If the observed reduction in length of stay can be maintained, costs will reduce by €14M (29.0%). Such a cost saving may alleviate the effect of the demographic changes and observed increases in procedure rates. Steady-state assumptions are unrealistic and efficiency gains can alleviate future pressure from population growth. However, this analysis has not addressed the present insufficient capacity of public hospitals to meet population needs, as judged by waiting lists and transfers to private hospitals.

The 2014 federal rescheduling regulation is associated with reduced opioid prescribing in the general US population; however, to date, no data have been published on this regulation's effect on persons with disabilities. We examined whether the 2014 hydrocodone rescheduling change was associated with reduced opioid prescribing among adult Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities. We identified 680 876 Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities aged 21-64 in 2013 and 657 687 in 2015 from a 20% national sample. We examined changes in the monthly opioid-prescribing rates from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015. We also compared opioid-prescribing rates in 2013 with rates in 2015. In 2014, the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities who received hydrocodone prescriptions decreased by 0.154% per month (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.186 to -0.121, P < .001). The percentage of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities who received hydrocodone prescriptions decreased from 32.2% in 2013 to 27.7% in 2015, whereas rates of any opioid prescribing, prolonged prescribing (≥90-day supply), and high-dose prescribing (≥100 morphine milligram equivalents per day for >30 days) decreased only modestly, from 50.2% to 49.0%, from 27.4% to 26.5%, and from 7.5% to 7.0%, respectively. The 2014 federal rescheduling of hydrocodone was associated with only minor changes in overall and potentially high-risk opioid-prescribing rates. Neither state variation in long-term prescribing nor beneficiary characteristics explained the changes in persistently high opioid-prescribing rates among adults with disabilities after the 2014 regulation.

The truncated lamin A protein produced  progerin  has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. We previously showed that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork (RF) stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. We also found that calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D, rescues RS and represses the cGAS/STING/IFN cascade. Here, we delve into mechanisms underlying RS in progerin-expressing cells and the rescue by calcitriol. We find that progerin elicits a marked downregulation of RAD51, concomitant with increased levels of phosphorylated-RPA (P-RPA), a marker of RS. Interestingly, calcitriol prevents RS and activation of the cGAS/STING/IFN response in part through maintenance of RAD51 levels in progerin-expressing cells. Thus, loss of RAD51 is one of the consequences of progerin expression that could contribute to replication stress and activation of the IFN response. Stabilization of RAD51 helps explain the beneficial effects of calcitriol in these processes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. This article is protected by copyright.

NCWS elicits a wide range of symptoms including diarrhoea, intestinal discomfort, and fatigue in analogy with other wheat/gluten-related disorders and celiac disease in particular. From the pathological standpoint, NCWS patients only have a slight increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes, while antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and villous atrophy, otherwise diagnostic features of celiac disease, are absent. To date, the diagnosis of NCWS relies on symptoms and exclusion of confounding diseases, since biomarkers are not yet available. Here, the expression levels of selected miRNAs were examined in duodenal biopsies and peripheral blood leukocytes collected from newly diagnosed patients with NCWS and, as controls, from patients with celiac disease and gluten-independent gastrointestinal problems. We identified a few miRNAs whose expression is higher in the intestinal mucosa of patients affected by NCWS in comparison to control patients affect by gluten-independent dyspeptic symptoms (Helicobacter pylori-negative) and celiac disease.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which resveratrol regulates postovulatory aging of oocytes are still insufficiently known. In this study, we found that resveratrol could delay postovulatory aging and improve developmental competence of oocytes through activating selective mitophagy in the mouse. Resveratrol could maintain spindle morphology but it disturbed cortical granule (CG) distribution during oocyte aging. This might be due to upregulated mitophagy, since blocking mitophagy by cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment affected oocyte quality by damaging mitochondrial function and it decreased embryonic development. In addition, we also observed an involvement of FoxO3a in regulating mitophagy in aging oocytes following resveratrol treatment. Taken together, our results provide evidence that mitophagy induced by resveratrol is a potential mechanism to protect against postovulatory oocyte aging. "}

Natural polymers, especially chitosan, are of particular interest due to their excellent biological properties, such as biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and antimicrobial properties. One way to produce chitosan coating is by covalent grafting with catechol molecules such as dopamine, caffeic acid, and tannic acid, resulting in an attachment ten times stronger than that of simple physisorption. Caffeic acid presents an advantage over dopamine because it allows direct chitosan grafting, due to its terminal carboxylic acid group, without the need of a linking arm, as employed in the dopamine approach. In this study, the grafting of chitosan using caffeic acid, over surfaces or in solution, is compared with dopamine grafting using poly(ethylene glycol) as a linking arm. The following coating properties are observed; covering and homogeneity are assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses, hydrophilicity with contact angle measurements, stability with aging tests, anticorrosion behavior, and coating non-toxicity. Results show that grafting using caffeic acid/chitosan in solution over a metallic surface may be advantageous, compared to traditional dopamine coating. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To cope with drought stress, plants have isohydric or anisohydric water use strategies. Ozone enters plant tissues through stomata. Therefore, stomatal closure can be interpreted as avoidance to O3 stress. Here we applied an optimization model of stomata involving water, CO2 and O3 flux to test whether isohydric and anisohydric strategies may affect avoidance of O3 stress by stomatal closure in four Mediterranean tree species during drought. The data suggest that stomatal closure represents a response to avoid damage to the photosynthetic mechanisms under elevated O3 depending on plant water use strategy. Under high O3 and well-watered conditions, isohydric species limited O3 fluxes by stomatal closure, while anisohydric species activated a tolerance response and did not actively close stomata. Under both O3 and drought stress, however, anisohydric species enhanced the capacity of avoidance by closing stomata to cope with the severe oxidative stress. In the late growing season, regardless of the water use strategy, the efficiency of O3 stress avoidance decreased with leaf ageing. As a result, carbon assimilation rate was decreased by O3 while stomata did not close enough to limit transpirational water losses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

However, reading prostatectomy histopathology slides, which is basically for staging, is usually time-consuming and differs from reading small biopsy specimens, which is mainly used for diagnosis. Generally, each prostatectomy specimen generates tens of large tissue sections and for each section, the malignant region needs to be delineated to assess the amount of tumor and its burden. With the aim of reducing the workload of pathologists, in this study, we focus on developing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on a densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) for whole-slide histopathology images to outline the malignant regions. We use an efficient color normalization process based on ranklet transformation to automatically correct the intensity of the images. Additionally, we use spatial probability to segment the tissue structure regions for different tissue recognition patterns. Based on the segmentation, we incorporate a multidimensional structure into DenseNet to determine if a particular prostatic region is benign or malignant. As demonstrated by the experimental results with a test set of 2,663 images from 32 whole-slide prostate histopathology images, our proposed system achieved 0.726, 0.6306, and 0.5209 in the average of the Dice coefficient, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and Boundary F1 score measures, respectively.

This prospective clinical study was conducted between January and April 2019 at a tertiary health facility. Nasal tip resistances were measured in four different age-groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-64, and > 65 years) with a digital Newton meter. A total of 159 patients with a minimum of 36 patients per group were included in the study. Nasal tip resistance measurements were compared among nasal tip displacement distances of 2, 3, and 4 mm, focusing on age and sex. The nasal tip resistance of the 20-29 age-group was significantly higher at 2, 3, and 4 mm nasal tip displacement distances, when compared with the 30-39 and 40-64 age-groups, whereas compared to the > 65 years group, it was significantly higher at 3 and 4 mm nasal tip displacement distances (p < 0.005). Nasal tip resistance of males was found to be significantly higher than that of females, at 3 and 4 mm nasal tip displacement distances (p < 0.001). Nasal tip resistance is higher in males and universally decreases significantly after 30 years of age while remaining constant at later ages. Therefore, surgeons should prefer nasal tip resistance increasing techniques in the rhinoplasty operations that are performed on patients even from early years of age, in order to maintain and strengthen the nasal tip resistance.

Cutoffs for CSF biomarkers were higher for Aβ1-42 in African American relative to white individuals (208 [95% CI, 126-321] vs 197 [95% CI, 183-245] pg/mL) and lower for tau (51 [95% CI, 31-59] vs 59 [95% CI, 56-92] pg/mL) and pTau181 (12 [95% CI, 12-19] vs 20 [95% CI, 12-27] pg/mL) levels. Cutoffs for the pTau181 to Aβ1-42 ratio were 0.05 (95% CI, 0.03-0.12) for African American participants and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.05-0.13) for white participants. This study found that African American individuals had lower levels of tau-based biomarkers that were not likely explained by the degree of disease stage or neurodegeneration reflected by hippocampal volumes. This study suggests that race is an important factor when interpreting CSF biomarkers, especially in the clinical diagnosis of prodromal AD. It appears that using the pTau181 to Aβ1-42 ratio may ameliorate these differences. "}

The modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era has resulted in PLWH living normal life spans with resulting increased comorbidities. CPs have long been a part of the multidisciplinary management of ART. However, with the changing demographics of PLWH and health-care system dynamics, CPs have had the opportunity to expand their role. This includes involvement in managing increasing comorbidities with expanding and more complicated medication regimens, drug interaction monitoring, and optimizing transitions of care, all while recognizing and addressing barriers to successful HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. In addition, with the expansion of HIV prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services, CPs have the opportunity to be involved in HIV prevention. This study summarizes the literature evaluating the impact of CPs in the management of PLWH in the era of modern ART. We conducted a literature search to identify studies that assessed the CP role in HIV clinical practice since 2006. The identified studies were grouped into two categories. The first was HIV related outcomes, including interventions on regimen selection, adherence, regimen optimization, and management of treatment failure. The second group of studies pertained to aging and vulnerable populations, including management of comorbidities, transitions of care, medication-assisted treatment, hepatitis C, and HIV screening and PrEP. We concluded that the evidence supports the expanding role of CPs to positively impact a variety of aspects related to the care of PLWH. Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer. "}

Causes of low libido in this age group are not well understood. We used qualitative methods to explore older women's perceptions of causes of low libido. We conducted 15 individual interviews and 3 focus groups (total N = 36) among sexually active women 60 and older who screened positive for low libido using a validated instrument. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using a codebook developed by two investigators. Codes were examined, and themes related to causes of low libido emerged. Women noted a number of different factors that contributed to low libido. The common factors that women discussed included postmenopausal vaginal symptoms, erectile dysfunction in male partners, fatigue and bodily pain, life stressors, and body image concerns. Women often found ways to adapt to these factors. These adaptations required open communication between partners regarding sex, and some women noted these conversations were difficult or not successful. A wide variety of factors contribute to low libido in women over 60, but many of these factors are addressable. Low libido in older women should not be automatically attributed to  normal  aging or to menopause; providers should take an approach to assessment and treatment that addresses biological, interpersonal and social, and psychological factors. : Video Summary: http://links.lww.com/MENO/A499.

We sought to determine whether patients with lower extremity osteoarthritis (OA) who underwent total joint arthroplasty (TJA) had a reduced risk of falling compared with those with OA who did not undergo TJA. The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database was queried from 2000 to 2015 to identify 499,094 cases with primary diagnosis of hip or knee OA. Patients were stratified into 4 cohorts: group 1 (hip OA with total hip arthroplasty [THA] [N = 168,234]), group 2 (hip OA without THA [N = 22,482]), group 3 (knee OA with total knee arthroplasty [TKA] [N = 275,651]), and group 4 (knee OA without TKA [N = 32,826]). Patients were followed up longitudinally to evaluate the long-term risks of subsequent traumatic falls. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to examine the relationship between patients' demographics and clinical characteristics and the risk of subsequent traumatic falls and reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Nineteen thousand seven hundred seventeen patients with hip OA underwent 168,234 primary THAs (88.2%), and 308,477 patients with knee OA underwent 275,651 primary TKAs (89.4%) during the period 2000 to 2015.

Chronic treated HIV-1 infection is associated with significant risk of end-organ impairment, non-AIDS-associated malignancies, and accelerated physiologic aging. Coupled with the chronologic aging of the HIV-1-positive population, the development of therapies that target these processes is of great clinical importance. Age-related diseases are partly the result of cellular senescence. Both immune and nonimmune cell subsets are thought to mediate this senescent phenotype, a state of stable cell cycle arrest characterized by sustained release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Recent research in the field of aging has identified a number of 'senotherapeutics' to combat aging-related diseases, pharmacologic agents that act either by selectively promoting the death of senescent cells ('senolytics') or modifying senescent phenotype ('senomorphics'). Senescence is a hallmark of aging-related diseases that is characterized by stable cell cycle arrest and chronic inflammation. Chronic HIV-1 infection predisposes patients to aging-related illnesses and is similarly marked by a senescence-like phenotype. A better understanding of the role of HIV-1 in aging will inform the development of therapeutics aimed at eliminating senescent cells that drive accelerated physiologic aging. "}

In addition, recent evidence shows that implementing certain strategies in planning for end of life, including advance care planning and palliative care involvement, can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and ensure care respects patient values and preferences. Shifting focus from prolonging life to enhancing quality of life in heart failure patients approaching the end of life can be achieved by recognizing and managing end-stage heart failure-related symptoms, advanced care planning, and a multidisciplinary care approach.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can enhance the restorative effects of Erbium fractional laser, but there are few studies on this combined treatment in the Asian population, and no study has examined the effects of adding platelet-poor plasma (PPP) to the combination. This study aims to investigate the effects and safety of Erbium fractional laser irradiation combined with autologous PRP and PPP therapy for facial rejuvenation. Between January 2010 and June 2016, 158 patients with facial skin aging were treated by Erbium fractional laser irradiation combined with autologous PRP and PPP. After three sessions, patients and experienced physicians evaluated the effectiveness of the treatment. The symptoms of skin aging, especially skin color, pore expansion, and skin texture, showed obvious improvement after the treatment, according to the evaluation of the patients and the physicians, who reported a total treatment effectiveness rate of 90.51% and 88.61%, respectively. The treatment was well-tolerated by all the participants, and no hyperpigmentation or depigmentation was observed in any of the cases. The reported side effects were edema (1-3 days), erythema (2-4 days), and crusting (3-10 days). Erbium fractional laser irradiation combined with PRP and PPP application is an effective and safe approach for improving facial skin aging and has minimal side effects.

Also, rodent models of circadian arrhythmia, such as the constitutive knockout of the clock gene Bmal1, leads to metabolic disturbances and early death. Although astrocyte clock regulates molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms, its involvement in the regulation of energy balance and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that astrocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1 is sufficient to alter energy balance, glucose homeostasis, and reduce lifespan. Mutant animals displayed impaired hypothalamic molecular clock, age-dependent astrogliosis, apoptosis of hypothalamic astrocytes, and increased glutamate and GABA levels. Importantly, modulation of GABAA-receptor signaling completely restored glutamate levels, delayed the reactive gliosis as well as the metabolic phenotypes and expanded the lifespan of the mutants. Our results demonstrate that the astrocytic clock can influence many aspects of brain function and neurological disease and suggest astrocytes and GABAA receptor as pharmacological targets to prevent the metabolic dysfunctions and shortened lifespan associated with alterations of circadian rhythms. © 2019 The Authors.

We used data from the nationally representative survey, including 2428 hypertensive participants free from depressive symptoms at baseline in 2011-2012.

We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the incidence of depressive symptoms in 2011-2015. In the total sample, all the models resulted in non-significant result and an estimated 8% reduction in risk (95% CI 0·76-1·12) in the model adjusted for all covariates for the antihypertensive treatment takers with blood pressure controlled. In the group of urban residents, the antihypertensive treatment takers with blood pressure controlled had lower odds (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0·49-0·96) of depressive disorders. The protective effect of the antihypertensive therapies might be relative to not only lowering blood pressure per se but also the management of hypertension.

Recent evidence suggests that hearing-impaired individuals have greater risks of developing cognitive impairment and dementia compared to people with intact auditory function, although the neurobiological bases underlying these associations are poorly understood. Here, a colony of aging macaques completed a battery of behavioral tests designed to probe frontal and temporal lobe-dependent cognition. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and visual evoked potentials were measured to assess auditory and visual system function. Structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging were then performed to evaluate the microstructural condition of multiple white matter tracts associated with cognition. Animals showing higher cognitive function had significantly better auditory processing capacities, and these associations were selectively observed with tasks that primarily depend on temporal lobe brain structures. Tractography analyses revealed that the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fimbria-fornix and hippocampal commissure were associated with temporal lobe-dependent visual discrimination performance and auditory sensory function. Conversely, FA of frontal cortex-associated white matter was not associated with auditory processing. Visual sensory function was not associated with frontal or temporal lobe FA, nor with behavior. This study demonstrates significant and selective relationships between ABRs, white matter connectivity, and higher-order cognitive ability. © The Author(s) 2019.

Disease progression is not consistent from person to person. Psychosocial factors are hypothesized to play a modifying role. Self-efficacy, the confidence in one's ability to perform well in a specific life domain or at a specific task, is associated with better health outcomes. Coping self-efficacy is confidence in one's ability to handle life's problems through emotional regulation, problem-solving, and social support. Little is known about associations between coping self-efficacy and inflammation. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine associations between coping self-efficacy and IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels. This was a cross-sectional study conducted over two visits. Sociodemographic variables, chronic disease count, body mass index (BMI), and coping self-efficacy were collected. Inflammatory markers were collected via sweat using the sweat patch, a noninvasive collection device. Higher TNF-α and IL-10 levels were significantly associated with low coping self-efficacy (β = -.03, p = .028; β = -.017, p = .007, respectively) after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, and chronic disease count. IL-6 trended toward significance after adjustment as well (β = -.22, p = .054). This pilot study showed that high coping self-efficacy was associated with lower IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels, indicating a potential buffering effect of high coping self-efficacy.

Individuals with higher educational attainment may develop greater brain pathology prior to the onset of cognitive decline. However, whether education moderates relations between central artery aging and cognitive performance is unknown. We hypothesized that years of formal education would moderate the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance in middle-aged/older (MA/O) adults (n = 113, age 67.3 ± 0.7 years). Significant interactions between education*central systolic BP (β = .21, p = .02) and education*central PP (β = .22, p = .01) demonstrated weaker associations between central BP and PP with processing speed performance in those with higher education. Similarly, education moderated the relation between aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, cfPWV) and executive function performance (β = .21, p = .02). To test if the relation between central arterial aging and cognitive performance was captured by a predetermined education threshold, MA/O adults were secondarily categorized as ≤high school (HS) (i.e., ≤12 years, n = 36) or >HS (≥13 years, n = 77). Higher central systolic BP was associated with slower processing speed (≤HS: r = -.59, p < .001 vs. >HS: r = -.25, p = .03) and weaker executive function (r = -.39, p = .03 vs. r = -.32, p = .006). Higher cfPWV was selectively correlated with weaker executive function performance (r = -.39, p = .03) in ≤HS only and this association significantly differed between education groups.

{"PMID":31833215,"Title":"Maf1-dependent transcriptional regulation of tRNAs prevents genomic instability and is associated with extended lifespan.","Abstract":" Maf1 is the master repressor of RNA polymerase III responsible for transcription of tRNAs and 5S rRNAs. Maf1 is negatively regulated via phosphorylation by the mTOR pathway, which governs protein synthesis, growth control, and lifespan regulation in response to nutrient availability. Inhibiting the mTOR pathway extends lifespan in various organisms. However, the downstream effectors for the regulation of cell homeostasis that are critical to lifespan extension remain elusive. Here we show that fission yeast Maf1 is required for lifespan extension. Maf1's function in tRNA repression is inhibited by mTOR-dependent phosphorylation, whereas Maf1 is activated via dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase complexes, PP4 and PP2A. Mutational analysis reveals that Maf1 phosphorylation status influences lifespan, which is correlated with elevated tRNA and protein synthesis levels in maf1∆ cells. However, mTOR downregulation, which negates protein synthesis, fails to rescue the short lifespan of maf1∆ cells, suggesting that elevated protein synthesis is not a cause of lifespan shortening in maf1∆ cells. Interestingly, maf1∆ cells accumulate DNA damage represented by formation of Rad52 DNA damage foci and Rad52 recruitment at tRNA genes. Loss of the Rad52 DNA repair protein further exacerbates the shortened lifespan of maf1∆ cells. Strikingly, PP4 deletion alleviates DNA damage and rescues the short lifespan of maf1∆ cells even though tRNA synthesis is increased in this condition, suggesting that elevated DNA damage is the major cause of lifespan shortening in maf1∆ cells. We propose that Maf1-dependent inhibition of tRNA synthesis controls fission yeast lifespan by preventing genomic instability that arises at tRNA genes. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we created a mouse model in which progerin, the lamin A mutant protein that causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), can be inducibly overexpressed. Muscle-specific overexpression of progerin was sufficient to induce muscular dystrophy and alter whole-body energy expenditure, leading to premature death. Intriguingly, sarcolipin (Sln), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein involved in heat production, is upregulated in progerin-expressing and Lmna knockout (Lmna-/- ) skeletal muscle. The depletion of Sln accelerated the early death of Lmna-/- mice. An examination at the molecular level revealed that progerin recruits Sln and Calnexin to the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, progerin-expressing myoblasts presented enhanced store-operated Ca2+ entry, as well as increased co-localization of STIM1 and ORAI1.

Most older individuals are affected by multiple chronic diseases, leading to complex drug treatments and increased risk of physical and cognitive disability. Improving or preserving the health and quality of life of these individuals is challenging due to a lack of well-established clinical guidelines. Physicians are often forced to engage in cycles of  trial and error  that are centered on palliative treatment of symptoms rather than the root cause, often resulting in dubious outcomes. Recently, geroscience challenged this view, proposing that the underlying biological mechanisms of aging are central to the global increase in susceptibility to disease and disability that occurs with aging. In fact, strong correlations have recently been revealed between health dimensions and phenotypes that are typical of aging, especially with autophagy, mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and DNA methylation. Current research focuses on measuring the pace of aging to identify individuals who are  aging faster  to test and develop interventions that could prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and disability with aging. Understanding how the underlying biological mechanisms of aging connect to and impact longitudinal changes in health trajectories offers a unique opportunity to identify resilience mechanisms, their dynamic changes, and their impact on stress responses. Harnessing how to evoke and control resilience mechanisms in individuals with successful aging could lead to writing a new chapter in human medicine. © 2019 The Authors.

Because activated platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells release proinflammatory and prothrombotic extracellular vesicles (EVs), we hypothesized that the release of EVs is more efficiently inhibited by ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. We compared EV concentrations and EV procoagulant activity in plasma of patients after AMI treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel. After percutaneous coronary intervention, 60 patients with first AMI were randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Flow cytometry was used to determine concentrations of EVs from activated platelets (CD61+ , CD62p+ ), fibrinogen+ , phosphatidylserine (PS+ ), from leukocytes (CD45+ ), endothelial cells (CD31+ ,146+ ) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ ) in plasma at randomisation, after 72 hours and 6 months of treatment. Fibrin generation test was used to determine EV procoagulant activity. Concentrations of platelet, fibrinogen+ , PS+ , leukocyte and erythrocyte EVs increased 6 months after AMI compared to the acute phase of AMI (p≤0.03).

Within this context, domiciliary services are increasingly failing to deliver care that respects the individuality and heterogeneity of older people. To date, there has been limited research in the U.K. that explores, from the older person's perspective, how care practices interact with self. Using biographical-narrative methodology, this study takes a constructionist approach to understand the individual's lived experience of care and how it interacts with sense of self. A three-stage model of data collection was used, beginning with a narrative biographic enquiry, exploring with participants (65 yrs +, n = 17) their journeys into care and any possible relationship to personal identity. Stage 2 involved a two-week period of diary completion, with participants recording daily reflections on their care experiences. In stage 3, a semi-structured interview explored the diary entries, linking back to the narrative biographic enquiry to reveal ways in which specific care practices interacted with the sense of self. The findings reveal that a strong relationship between older person and formal carer, forged through familiarity, regularity and consistency, plays a significant role in promoting feelings of autonomy. Furthermore, such relationship mediates against the loss of executional autonomy that often accompanies increasing disability. Maintaining autonomy and control was a recurring theme, including in relation to home, privacy and dignity. Feelings of autonomy are also promoted when formal carers understand the unique ways in which individuals experience ageing and being in the cared-for relationship. This paper suggests that a care approach should be based on two tenets. First, a knowledge and insight into the importance of understanding and respecting the older person's continuing development of self, and second applying this knowledge to care through a positive, stable and consistent relationship between the older person and the carer. © 2019 The Authors.

While it is generally agreed that physical activity (PA)/sport-based interventions promote cognitive and social development in the general population, little is known about their specific benefits in adults with ID. The aims of this systematic review were (a) to examine the effects of PA/sport-based interventions on intention, motivation and attitude regarding PA/sport participation in adults with ID and (b) to investigate the influence of these psychological factors on behavioural change (e.g. PA level) and quality of life. A systematic review has been conducted searching four electronic databases (i.e. SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed and Cochrane Library). Studies were included if written in English, peer reviewed, had primary research data, and measured intention, motivation, attitude, behavioural outcomes or quality of life. Thirteen articles met our inclusion criteria of which 10 explored the effects of PA/sport as part of a multi-component intervention. Most investigated outcomes were exercise self-efficacy and quality of life. Five studies measured exercise self-efficacy, and four of them found significant changes. One study found a significant improvement in quality of life and another study in life satisfaction. We observed lack of sport-based interventions, few data about people with severe ID and limited psychological measures. Personal and environmental factors are key components of behavioural change. Support of caregivers and individualised instructions may benefit exercise self-efficacy. There is lack of information about the effects of psychological factors on behavioural change and quality of life in adults with ID. © 2019 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Based on our previous studies, some recipient cows with a cloned fetus would present as engorged uterine vessels and enlarged umbilical vessels randomly. Abortion involves both maternal and fetal factors. Our aim was to explore this phenomenon by microRNAs expression profile analysis of maternal corpus luteum (CL), which was related to pregnancy maintenance. The present study provided the comparison of maternal CL miRNAs expression of abnormally and normally developed cloned bovine fetus at late gestation (~ 210 days) using RNA-Seq technology. We selected two abnormally pregnant cows (abnormal group, AG) and three normally pregnant cows (normal group, NG) and acquired valid reads of 9317,261-12,327,185 (~ 84.53-91.28%) from five libraries. In total, we identified 981 conserved miRNAs and 223 novel miRNAs. 1052 miRNAs were co-expressed, 124 miRNAs were uniquely expressed in AG, and 93 miRNAs were uniquely expressed in the NG. Compared with NG, 11 were significantly overexpressed, and 22 were downregulated (p < 0.05) at AG among 1052 co-expressed miRNAs. The differentially expressed miRNAs-targeted genes were further analyzed by Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis. Notably, the steroid biosynthesis pathway was a significantly enriched term (p < 0.01), which may affect the secretion of progesterone. Our research suggested that abnormal miRNAs expression of bovine maternal CL may affect the pregnant status at late gestation. "}

{"PMID":31833023,"Title":"Neurophysiological Markers of Alzheimer's Disease: Quantitative EEG Approach.","Abstract":" Currently established and employed biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominantly mirror AD-associated molecular and structural brain changes. While they are necessary for identifying disease-specific neuropathology, they lack a clear and robust relationship with the clinical presentation of dementia; they can be altered in healthy individuals, while they often inadequately mirror the degree of cognitive and functional deficits in affected subjects. There is growing evidence that synaptic loss and dysfunction are early events during the trajectory of AD pathogenesis that best correlate with the clinical symptoms, suggesting measures of brain functional deficits as candidate early markers of AD. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely available and noninvasive diagnostic method that provides direct insight into brain synaptic activity in real time. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis additionally provides information on physiologically meaningful frequency components, dynamic alterations and topography of EEG signal generators, i.e. neuronal signaling. Numerous studies have shown that qEEG measures can detect disruptions in activity, topographical distribution and synchronization of neuronal (synaptic) activity such as generalized EEG slowing, reduced global synchronization and anteriorization of neuronal generators of fast-frequency resting-state EEG activity in patients along the AD continuum. Moreover, qEEG measures appear to correlate well with surrogate markers of AD neuropathology and discriminate between different types of dementia, making them promising low-cost and noninvasive markers of AD. Future large-scale longitudinal clinical studies are needed to elucidate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of qEEG measures as early functional markers of AD on an individual subject level. "}

To delineate the personality profile distinctive for migraineurs and to explore the relationship between personality traits and depression in migraineurs compared to non-migraineurs. A systematic literature search was performed up to March 2019 using PsycInfo (PROQUEST), PubMed and Scopus. Sixteen primary studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis on the personality defined according to Psychobiological model revealed high Harm Avoidance (Hedges'g = 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01-0.60), Persistence (Hedges'g = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.01to - 0.72) and low self-directedness (Hedges'g = - 0.33; 95% CI = -0.57 to - 0.09) in migraineurs. The meta-analysis on the personality defined according to Three Factor Model revealed high neuroticism (Hedges'g = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.32-0.63) and low extraversion (Hedges'g = - 0.08; 95% CI = - 0.14 to - 0.03) in migraineurs. Meta-regression analysis revealed that neuroticism moderated the relationship between depression and migraine. The findings evidenced that migraine is characterized by specific personality traits. Among them, neuroticism influenced the severity of depression in migraineurs, and, therefore, an early evaluation of the personality traits could allow identifying patients susceptible to develop migraine-associated psychopathological symptoms.

To contain costs many welfare states rely on the family as care provider and, in addition, people in need of care often prefer being cared for at home. Thus, the number of people who provide care privately and without pay in the home environment (referred to as family care in this article) is likely to increase. So far, however, research on the impact of family care on the labor market situation of caregivers in general and their wages in particular remains scarce. This article examines whether and if so to what extent, family care affects the wages of women and men. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2001-2017), fixed effects regressions were estimated separately for women and men, while accounting for important confounders. Both women (2.4%) and men (3%) suffer wage losses as a result of family care activities. The results indicate that care-related wage losses, net of relevant controls, exist. "}

Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), in which action potentials recorded extracellularly from a single neuron are used to trigger stimulation at another cortical location (closed-loop), is an effective treatment for behavioral recovery after brain lesion, but the related neurophysiological changes are still not clear. Here, we investigated the ability of ADS and random stimulation (RS) to alter firing patterns of distant cortical locations. We recorded 591 neuronal units from 23 Long-Evan healthy anesthetized rats. Stimulation was delivered to either forelimb or barrel field somatosensory cortex, using either RS or ADS triggered from spikes recorded in the rostral forelimb area (RFA). Both RS and ADS stimulation protocols rapidly altered spike firing within RFA compared with no stimulation. We observed increase in firing rates and change of spike patterns. ADS was more effective than RS in increasing evoked spikes during the stimulation periods, by producing a reliable, progressive increase in stimulus-related activity over time and an increased coupling of the trigger channel with the network. These results are critical for understanding the efficacy of closed-loop electrical microstimulation protocols in altering activity patterns in interconnected brain networks, thus modulating cortical state and functional connectivity. © The Author(s) 2019.

The Korean Society for Bone and Mineral Research and the Korean Society of Exercise Physiology developed exercise guidelines to increase the peak bone mass (PBM) in adolescents based on evidence through a systematic review of previous research. Articles were selected using the systematic method, and the exercise guidelines were established by selecting key questions (KQs) and defining the effects of exercises based on evidence through a literature review for selecting the final exercise method. There were 9 KQs. An online search was conducted on articles published since 2000, and 93 articles were identified. An increase in PBM in adolescence was effective for preventing osteoporosis and fractures in older age. Exercise programs as part of vigorous physical activity (VPA) including resistance and impact exercise at least 5 to 6 months were effective for improving PBM in adolescents. It is recommended that resistance exercise is performed 10 to 12 rep·set-1 1-2 set·region-1 and 3 days·week-1 using the large muscles. For impact exercises such as jumping, it is recommended that the exercise is performed at least 50 jumps·min-1, 10 min·day-1 and 2 days·week-1. Exercise guidelines were successfully developed, and they recommend at least 5 to 6 months of VPA, which includes both resistance and impact exercises. With the development of exercise guidelines, the incidence of osteoporosis and fractures in the aging society can be reduced in the future, thus contributing to improved public health.

With the expectation of addressing this dilemma, human ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) has been reengineered as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-tridimensional-spheroid biologics (ETSB) using a dynamic EMT-3D-floating system along with 160 Gy X-ray-amelioration, which inoculates subcutaneously into aging rhesus and athymic Balb/c  nu/nu  mice. Herein, it is bioinformatically validated that ETSB can reset Clock/Arntl-Per3/Tim molecule rhythm dynamics to re-prime thymus residual (parathyroid or fatty-like invalid vesicles yet no thymic architecture) to evolutionary transcription with overall cortex-medulla endogenized by TECs undergoing MET/EMT reversion. Rhythm dynamics immediately resettles the bHLH-LTβR-NFκB-RelA/B loop as a cascade to provoke the core immune microenvironment for multifunctional innovation of dynamic TCR orchestration, with harmonious naïve T-subsets and TRECs renewals (P < 0.005). Subsequently, peripheral biological burden and tumor metastasis dynamics are addressed by innovative TCR-defense/attack dynamics quickly (P < 0.005 vs Control), yet without autoimmune indication to hosts. Moreover, a functional blockade of core-rhythm dynamics deeply impedes the endogenous innovation of invalid thymus residual. Thus this study may help pioneer a prospective strategy to innovate panoramic central-peripheral immune microenvironments and defense dynamics for immune-deficient/aging victims. © 2019 The Authors.

However, polyethylene wear can significantly reduce the lifespan of UKA. Different bearing designs and materials for UKA have been developed to change the rate of polyethylene wear. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of insert conformity and material on the predicted wear in mobile-bearing UKA using a previously developed computational wear method. Two different designs were tested with the same femoral component under identical kinematic input: anatomy mimetic design (AMD) and conforming design inserts with different conformity levels. The insert materials were standard or crosslinked ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). We evaluated the contact pressure, contact area, wear rate, wear depth, and volumetric wear under gait cycle loading conditions. Conforming design inserts had the lower contact pressure and larger contact area. However, they also had the higher wear rate and volumetric wear. The improved wear performance was found with AMD inserts. In addition, the computationally predicted volumetric wear of crosslinked UHMWPE inserts was less than half that of standard UHMWPE inserts. Our results showed that increasing conformity may not be the sole predictor of wear performance; highly crosslinked mobile-bearing polyethylene inserts can also provide improvement in wear performance. These results provide improvements in design and materials to reduce wear in mobile-bearing UKA.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2019;8:563-569. © 2019 Author(s) et al. "}

Prevalence will continue to rise and is estimated to reach 3% of the population in Western countries by 2025. It is the most important cause of hospitalisation in subjects aged 65 years or more, resulting in high costs and major social impact. The current  one-size-fits-all  approach in the treatment of HF does not result in best outcome for all patients. These facts are an imminent threat to good quality management of patients with HF.

Imaging roots of growing maize is a non-invasive, affordable and high throughput approach. However, it's difficult to get integral root images because of the block of the soil. The paper proposed an algorithm to repair incomplete root images for maize root fast non-invasive phenotyping detection. A two-layer transparent stress growth device with two concentric cylinders was developed as mesocosms and the maize seeds were planted in the annulus of it. The maize roots grow in soil against two acrylic plastic surfaces due to the press of the small growing area to acquire more root details during roots visualization and imaging. Even though, parts of the roots are occluded which means that it's tough to extract the information of root general physical construction. For recovering gaps from disconnected root segments, Progressive Corrosion Joining (PCJ) algorithm was proposed based on the physiological characteristics of hydrotropism, geostrophic and continuity with three steps which are root image thinning, progressive corrosion and joining processing respectively. The experiments indicate that maize phenotyping parameters are negative correlation with seed aging days. And specifically, Root Number (RTN), Root Length (RTL), Root Width (RTW) and Root Extension Length (REL) of unaged and 14-day-aged maize seeds are decreased from 15.40, 82.40 mm, 1.53 mm and 82.20 mm to 4.58, 38.6 mm, 1.35 mm and 55.20 mm, and the growing speed of them are changed from 1.68 per day, 8.80 mm/d, 0.06 mm/d, 9.0 mm/d to 0.70 per day, 4.3 mm/d, 0.05 mm/d and 5.70 mm/d respectively. Whereas Root Extension Angle (REA) is basically irrelevant with the level of maize seed aging. The developed double-layer Annular Root Phenotyping Container (ARPC) can satisfy the general physical construction of maize as well as push each root growing along the inner wall of the container which help to acquire more root information. The presented novel PCJ algorithm can recover the missing parts, even for big gaps, of maize roots effectively according to root morphological properties. The experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to evaluate the vigor of maize seeds which has vast application prospect in high throughput root phenotyping area. © The Author(s) 2019.

However, it is still unknown whether these two indices predict mortality independent of each other. Furthermore, their joint effect on all-cause mortality has not been well established, especially in oldest-old adults. Based on data from the 2012 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), we included 1447 oldest-old adults (mean age 84.7 years and 58.7% were female, weighted) with information on hs-CRP (stratified by a cutoff value of 3.0 mg/L) and cognition (quantified by Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scored according to the personal educational level) at baseline. Mortality was assessed in followed 2014 and 2017 waves. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, with adjustment for hs-CRP and cognition (mutually controlled) and several traditional mortality risk factors. During a median follow-up period of 32.8 months (Q1-Q3, 9.7-59.0 months), 826 participants died. Hs-CRP [HR > 3.0 mg/L vs ≤ 3.0 mg/L: 1.64 (95% CI, 1.17, 2.30)] and cognition [HR CI vs normal: 2.30 (95% CI, 1.64, 3.21)] each was independent predictor of all-cause mortality, even after accounting for each other and other covariates. Monotonic and positive associations were observed in combined analyses, in which the highest mortality risk was obtained in elders with both high hs-CRP> 3.0 mg/L and CI [HR: 3.56 (95% CI, 2.35, 5.38)].The combined effects were stronger in male and younger oldest-old (aged 80-89 years). High hs-CRP and CI, both individually and jointly, were associated with increased all-cause mortality risks in Chinese oldest-old.

Research has yielded mixed evidence about the influence of infant and child mortality in birth cohorts on adult health and mortality. Studies rarely consider the specific role of mortality within the family. We estimated how individuals' exposure to mortality as a child is related to their adult mortality risk between ages 18 and 85 in two historical populations, Utah (USA) 1874-2015 and Zeeland (The Netherlands) 1812-1957. We examined these associations for early community-level exposure to infant and early (before sixth birthday) and late (before eighteenth birthday) childhood mortality as well as exposure during these ages to sibling deaths. We find that that exposure in childhood to community mortality and sibling deaths increases adult mortality rates. Effects of sibling mortality on adult all-cause mortality risk were stronger in Utah, where sibling deaths were less common in relation to Zeeland. Exposure to sibling death due to infection was related to the surviving siblings' risk of adult mortality due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk: 1.06) and metabolic disease (relative risk: 1.42), primarily diabetes mellitus, a result consistent with an inflammatory immune response mechanism. We conclude that early-life conditions and exposure to mortality in early life, especially within families of origin, contribute to adult mortality. © The Author(s) 2018. "}

A cross-sectional study initially recruited 527 women, and a final analysis was carried out on 275 women aged 32-60 years. Nutrient intake was assessed using fourteen repetitions of 24-hour dietary recall. NPs were derived using principal component analysis. Associations between adherence to NPs and the SMI were evaluated using linear regression models. Three NPs were identified: 'Animal Protein-Vitamins', 'Fibre-Plant Protein-Minerals' and 'Fats'. In the adjusted model, the upper tertile compared to the bottom tertile of the 'Animal Protein-Vitamins' NP was related to a higher SMI (β = 0.123 95% CI: 0.019; 0.227; P for 1-SD increase of NP score = 0.009). No associations between the SMI and the 'Fibre-Plant Protein-Minerals' and 'Fats' NPs were observed. Our results indicate that high adherence to animal product-rich patterns might be related to higher muscle mass in adult women. Research on the influence of dietary and nutrient patterns on the quality of muscle tissue may contribute to the setting of guidelines for nutritional protection of skeletal muscle with ageing and, consequently, dietary recommendations that would improve the quality of women's lives at the later stage of life.

This is a Prospective, cross-sectional study. Thirty high myopia subjects and fifty healthy subjects were enrolled. Healthy and high myopia subjects were imaged with the SS-OCTA system (PLEX Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA, USA). For each eye, five 12 × 12-mm OCTA volume scans were acquired. The en face CC images were then exported to imageJ and a semi-automated algorithm was used for subsequent quantitative analysis. The main outcome was a quantitative analysis of the CC. This analysis was performed in three different regions: (i) peripapillary, (ii) macular, and (iii) periphery. In addition, CC variables were further investigated in distinct fields within these three different regions. Thirty myopic eyes (32 subjects; myopic group) and fifty eyes (50 subjects; control group) without elevated myopia were included in the analysis. Mean ± SD age was 26.9 ± 2.9 years [median: 27 years; range: 20.0-40.0 years]. Mean ± SD axial length was 26.6 ± 0.6 mm [median: 26.2 mm; range: 26.1 to 28.0 mm]. Mean ± SD axial length was 26.6 ± 0.6 mm [median: 26.2 mm; range: 26.1 to 28.0 mm] in the myopic group and 23.9 ± 1.1 mm [median: 23.9 mm; range: 21.8 to 25.9 mm] in the control group. The total signal void area was significantly greater in myopic eyes compared with control group. The peripapillary region exhibited the greatest total signal void area (p < 0.0001 vs macular region, p < 0.0001 vs peripheral region). Within the macular region, the foveal area exhibited a greater total signal void area in comparison with both the parafoveal area (p < 0.0001) and the perifoveal area (p < 0.0001). In conclusion we report quantitative mapping of the choriocapillaris in myopic eyes compared with an age-matched normal control group. The CC perfusion appears to have a wide topographical variation.

Here, we demonstrate that the human condensin II complex participates in senescence via gene regulation and reorganization of euchromatic A and heterochromatic B compartments. Both OIS and RS are accompanied by A-to-B and B-to-A compartmental transitions, the latter of which occur more frequently and are undergone by 14% (430 Mb) of the human genome. Mechanistically, condensin is enriched in A compartments and implicated in B-to-A transitions. The full activation of senescence genes (SASP genes and p53 targets) requires condensin; its depletion impairs senescence markers. This study describes that condensin reinforces euchromatic A compartments and promotes B-to-A transitions, both of which are coupled to optimal expression of senescence genes, thereby allowing condensin to contribute to senescent processes.

Increasing evidence indicates bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play an important role in adipogenesis and thermogenic balance in adipogenic progenitors and adipose tissue. However, the direct impact of BMPs on hepatic steatosis and possible association with NAFLD are poorly understood. Here, we found that BMP4 was up-regulated in oleic acid-induced steatosis and during the development of high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. Exogenous BMP4 reduced lipid accumulation and up-regulated the genes involved in lipid synthesis, storage and breakdown in hepatocytes. Exogenous BMP4 inhibited hepatic steatosis, reduced serum triglyceride levels and body weight, and alleviated progression of NAFLD in vivo. Mechanistically, BMP4 overexpression in hepatocytes down-regulated most components of the mTORC1 signaling axis. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that BMP4 may play an essential role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and the molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD. Manipulating BMP4 and/or mTORC1 signaling axis may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for obesity, metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD. "}

BQ increases oral cancer risk. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is responsible for matrix degradation, cancer invasion and metastasis. Whether areca nut extract (ANE), a BQ component, stimulates MMP-9 secretion, and the related signaling pathways awaits investigation. ANE (but not arecoline) stimulated MMP-9 production of gingival keratinocytes and SAS cancer epithelial cells. ANE stimulated TGF-β1, p-Smad2, and p-TAK1 protein expression. ANE-induced MMP-9 production/expression in SAS cells can be attenuated by SB431542 (ALK5/Smad2 inhibitor), 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol (TAK1 inhibitor), catalase, PD153035 (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), AG490 (JAK inhibitor), U0126 (MEK/ERK inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor), betel leaf (PBL) extract, and hydroxychavicol (HC, a PBL component), and melatonin, but not by aspirin. AN components contribute to oral carcinogenesis by stimulating MMP-9 secretion, thus enhancing tumor invasion/metastasis. These events are related to reactive oxygen species, TGF-β1, Smad2-dependent and -independent signaling, but not COX. These signaling molecules can be biomarkers of BQ carcinogenesis. PBL, HC and melatonin and other targeting therapy can be used for oral cancer treatment. ANE-induced MMP-9 expression/secretion of oral epithelial cells and related TGF-β1, Smad-dependent and -independent signaling were studied by MTT assay, RT-PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescent staining, and ELISA.

The current study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of DIgR2 expression by focusing on Nrf2 (nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2) signaling. We show that tHSCs co-culture induced significant Nrf2 signaling activation in mDCs. The latter was evidenced by Nrf2-Keap1 disassociation, Nrf2 protein stabilization, accumulation and nuclear translocation. Expression of Nrf2-dependent genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), were detected in tHSCs-co-cultured mDCs. Importantly tHSCs-induced DIgR2 expression was blocked by Nrf2 shRNA or knockout (KO, by CRISPR/Cas9 method). Conversely, forced activation of Nrf2, by Keap1 shRNA or the Nrf2 activators (3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione and MIND4-17), induced significant DIgR2 expression. tHSCs stimulation induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mDCs. Conversely, ROS scavengers inhibited tHSCs-induced ROS production, Nrf2 activation and DIgR2 expression in mDCs. Significantly, tHSCs inhibited production of multiple cytokines (CD80, CD86 and IL-12) in mDCs, reversed by Nrf2 depletion. Moreover, Nrf2 shRNA or KO attenuated splenic T cell inhibition by tHSCs-stimulated mDCs. Together, we conclude that Nrf2 activation mediates tHSCs-induced DIgR2 expression in mDCs. "}

Here, we investigated radiation-induced carcinogenesis using a model in which the mammary glands of 10-month-old BALB/c mice were transplanted with Trp53-null mammary tissue three days after exposure to low doses of sparsely ionizing γ-radiation or densely ionizing particle radiation. Mammary transplants in aged irradiated hosts gave rise to significantly more tumors that grew more rapidly than those in sham-irradiated mice, with the most pronounced effects seen in mice irradiated with densely ionizing particle radiation. Tumor transcriptomes identified a characteristic immune signature of these aggressive cancers. Consistent with this, fast-growing tumors exhibited an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with few infiltrating lymphocytes, abundant immunosuppressive myeloid cells, and high cyclooxgenase-2 and TGFβ. Only aged irradiated hosts gave rise to tumors lacking cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes (defined here as immune desert), which also occurred in younger mice. These data suggested that host irradiation may promote immunosuppression. To test this, young chimera mice were fed chow containing a honeybee-derived compound with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). CAPE prevented the detrimental effects of host irradiation on tumor growth rate, immune signature, and immunosuppression. These data indicated that low-dose radiation, particularly densely ionizing radiation, promoted more aggressive cancers by suppressing antitumor immunity. Dietary intervention with a non-toxic immunomodulatory agent could prevent systemic effects of radiation that fuel carcinogenesis, supporting the potential of this strategy for cancer prevention.

Serial salivary cortisol samples were collected multiple times within a 24-hour period at mean ages 61.2 and 65.9 years in Whitehall II and at age 60-64 years from NSHD participants. Cortisol profile is defined using cortisol awakening response and am:pm ratio. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination in Whitehall II and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, third version, in NSHD, harmonized into a 30-point score. Models were adjusted for age, sex, diagnoses of hypertension and diabetes, body mass index (BMI), educational attainment, and interval between HPAA and cognitive assessments. In fully adjusted models, increased am:pm cortisol ratio was prospectively associated with better later-life cognitive function years later (0.02 fewer errors per SD increase in am:pm cortisol ratio, p < 0.01) and verbal fluency (0.03 SD increase in verbal fluency per SD increase in am:pm ratio, p < 0.01). Increasing age, lower educational attainment, diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of diabetes, and increased BMI were associated with worse cognitive function and poorer verbal fluency. There were no associations between depression and later-life cognition or reverse associations between cognition and later-life cortisol profiles. Loss of diurnal HPAA variation is evident in individuals subsequently experiencing more cognitive impairment. It may serve as an early preclinical marker of cognitive decline.

This study aimed to investigate current trends in fall-related mortality in Japan using nationwide population-based data covering 1997-2016. We analysed fall-related deaths among older persons aged ≥65 years using the data provided by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The crude and age-standardised mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 persons by stratifying by age (65-74, 75-84 and ≥85 years) and sex. To identify trend changes, a joinpoint regression model was applied by estimating change points and annual percentage change (APC). The total number of fall-related deaths in Japan increased from 5872 in 1997 to 8030 in 2016, of which 78.8% involved persons aged ≥65 years. The younger population (65-74 years) showed continuous and faster-decreasing trends for both men and women. Average APC among men aged ≥75 years did not decrease. Among middle-aged and older women (75-84 and ≥85 years) decreasing trends were observed. Furthermore, the age-adjusted mortality rate of men was approximately twice that of women, and it showed a faster decrease for women. Although Japanese healthcare has shown improvement in preventing fall-related deaths over the last two decades, the crude mortality for those aged over 85 years remains high, indicating difficulty in reducing fall-related deaths in the super-aged population. Further investigations to uncover causal factors for falls in older populations are required. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

An iterative mixed-methods approach involving face-to-face user testing and semi-structured interviews was performed over three rounds with consumers and hospital health professionals. Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Thirty-seven consumers (or their carers) aged 65 years or older admitted to hospital in the previous 5 years and taking at least one regular medicine (not the medicine tested) completed user testing. Health professionals included a convenience sample of seven pharmacists and five doctors. The antipsychotic leaflet was tested in round 1 (consumers, n=10) and revised and retested in round 2 (consumers, n=9; health professionals, n=5). Findings from rounds 1 and 2 informed the design of the benzodiazepine/Z-drug and PPI leaflets tested in round 3 (benzodiazepine/Z-drug consumers, n=9; health professionals, n=7; PPI consumers, n=9). Findings from round 3 informed the final design of all leaflets. Consumer user testing involved 12-13 questions to evaluate consumers' ability to locate and understand information in the leaflet. Usability by health professionals was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). At least 80% of consumers correctly found and understood the deprescribing information in the leaflets (9 of 12 information points in round 1 (antipsychotic); 10 of 12 in round 2; 12 of 13 (benzodiazepine/Z-drug) and 11 of 12 (PPI) in round 3). Consumers perceived the leaflets to be informative, well-designed and useful aids for ongoing medication management. The SUS scores obtained from health professionals were 91.0±3.8 for the antipsychotic leaflet and 86.4±6.6 for the benzodiazepine/Z-drug leaflet, indicating excellent usability. Understandable and easy-to-use consumer information leaflets were developed and tested by consumers and health professionals. The feasibility and utility of these leaflets to support deprescribing at transitions of care should be explored in clinical practice. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In addition to physical frailty (PF), we explored mental (MF) and social (SF) frailty and studied the associations between multidimensional frailty and various adverse health outcomes. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted using data from a population-based cohort (SLAS-1) of 2387 community-dwelling Singaporean Chinese older adults. Outcomes examined were functional and severe disability, nursing home referral and mortality. PF was defined by shrinking, weakness, slowness, exhaustion and physical inactivity, 1-2 = pre-frail, 3-5 = frail; MF was defined by ≥1 of cognitive impairment, low mood and poor self-reported health; SF was defined by ≥2 of living alone, no education, no confidant, infrequent social contact or help, infrequent social activities, financial difficulty and living in low-end public housing. The prevalence of any frailty dimension was 63.0%, dominated by PF (26.2%) and multidimensional frailty (24.2%); 7.0% had all three frailty dimensions. With a few exceptions, frailty dimensions share similar associations with many socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and behavioral factors. Each frailty dimension varied in showing independent associations with functional (Odds Ratios [ORs] = 1.3-1.8) and severe disability prevalence at baseline (ORs = 2.2-7.3), incident functional disability (ORs = 1.1-1.5), nursing home referral (ORs = 1.5-3.4) and mortality (Hazard Ratios = 1.3-1.5) after adjusting for age, gender, medical comorbidity and the two other frailty dimensions. The addition of MF and SF to PF incrementally increased risk estimates by more than 2 folds. This study highlights the relevance and utility of PF, MF and SF individually and together. Multidimensional frailty can better inform policies and promote the use of targeted multi-domain interventions tailored to older adults' frailty statuses. "}

{"PMID":31830894,"Title":"Applicability of Low-Intensity Vibrations as a Regulatory Factor on Stem and Progenitor Cell Populations.","Abstract":" Persistent and transient mechanical loads can act as biological signals on all levels of an organism. It is therefore not surprising that most cell types can sense and respond to mechanical loads, similar to their interaction with biochemical and electrical signals. Presence or absence of mechanical forces can be an important determinant of form, function and health of many tissue types. Along with naturally occurring mechanical loads, it is possible to manipulate and apply external physical loads on tissues in biomedical sciences, either for prevention or treatment of catabolism related to many factors, including aging, paralysis, sedentary lifestyles and spaceflight. Mechanical loads consist of many components in their applied signal form such as magnitude, frequency, duration and intervals. Even though high magnitude mechanical loads with low frequencies (e.g. running or weight lifting) induce anabolism in musculoskeletal tissues, their applicability as anabolic agents is limited because of the required compliance and physical health of the target population. On the other hand, it is possible to use low magnitude and high frequency (e.g. in a vibratory form) mechanical loads for anabolism as well. Cells, including stem cells of the musculoskeletal tissue, are sensitive to high frequency, low-intensity mechanical signals. This sensitivity can be utilized not only for the targeted treatment of tissues, but also for stem cell expansion, differentiation and biomaterial interaction in tissue engineering applications. In this review, we reported recent advances in the application of low-intensity vibrations on stem and progenitor cell populations. Modulation of cellular behavior with low-intensity vibrations as an alternative or complementary factor to biochemical and scaffold induced signals may represent an increase of capabilities in studies related to tissue engineering.

After systematic screening and quality appraisal, 19 studies were included for review. Analysis was guided by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's existential philosophy of embodiment. Findings were organized using Max van Manen's reflective lifeworld existentials. Four ontological dimensions emerged, namely, being in a body (corporeality), being in time (temporality), being in place (spatiality), and being with others (relationality). Each dimension captures a distinct experiential dimension of this stage of the life course. The results suggest vast heterogeneity in the ontological experience of aging, supporting the view that diversity grows with age.

We investigated whether low-load blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFRRE) or remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) could improve functional capacity and quality of life in patients with CHF and stimulate skeletal muscle myofibrillar and mitochondrial adaptations. We randomized 36 patients with CHF to BFRRE, RIC, or nontreatment control. BFRRE and RIC were performed 3× per week for 6 weeks. Before and after intervention, muscle biopsies, tests of functional capacity, and quality of life assessments were performed. Deuterium oxide was administered throughout the intervention to measure cumulative RNA and subfraction protein synthesis. Changes in muscle fiber morphology and mitochondrial respiratory function were also assessed. BFRRE improved 6-minute walk test by 39.0 m (CI, 7.0-71.1, P=0.019) compared with control. BFRRE increased maximum isometric strength by 29.7 Nm (CI, 10.8-48.6, P=0.003) compared with control. BFRRE improved quality of life by 5.4 points (CI, -0.04 to 10.9; P=0.052) compared with control. BFRRE increased mitochondrial function by 19.1 pmol/s per milligram (CI, 7.3-30.8; P=0.002) compared with control. RIC did not produce similar changes.

We examined whether specific subtypes or characteristics of late-life depression predict mortality.Methods: A cohort study including 378 depressed older patients according to DSM-IV criteria and 132 never depressed comparisons. The predictive value of depression subtypes and characteristics on the six-year mortality rate, as well as their interaction with somatic disease burden and antidepressant drug use, were studied by Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for demographic and lifestyle characteristics.Results: Depressed persons had a higher mortality risk than non-depressed comparisons (HR = 2.95 [95% CI: 1.41-6.16], p = .004), which lost significance after adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, number of prescribed medications and somatic comorbidity. Regarding depression subtypes and characteristics, only minor depression was associated with a higher mortality risk when adjusted for confounders (HR = 6.59 [95% CI: 1.79-24.2], p = .005).Conclusions: Increased mortality rates of depressed older persons seem best explained by unhealthy lifestyle characteristics and multiple drug prescriptions. The high mortality rate in minor depression, independent of these factors, might point to another, yet unknown, pathway towards mortality for this depression subtype. An explanation might be that minor depression in later life reflects depressive symptoms due to underlying aging-related processes, such as inflammation-based sickness behavior, frailty, and mild cognitive impairment, which have all been associated with increased mortality.

This evidence-based research incorporates knowledge mobilization approaches that directly involve the three types of stakeholders in using the guidelines in the real world. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the knowledge translation of three guidelines on wander-management strategies, and to further deploy these guidelines to organizations across Canada.Methods: Steering committees across Canada were established for consultation. Guidelines were then shared among these organizations via Google slides. Health professionals, caregivers, community organizations and persons living with dementia completed an online survey (via Google) or paper-based survey to provide feedback on the guidelines. The guidelines were then translated from English to French using a forward-translation method.Results: The guidelines were adopted across ten organizations in four Canadian provinces. Adoption included introduction and formal training to staff. It took 22 months from the development of the guidelines to the dissemination and launch of the guidelines to the organizations. Participants (n = 73) were very satisfied with the developed guidelines and agreed they were easy to navigate, easy to understand, and the information provided was useful.Conclusions: A stakeholder-driven approach used for guideline development and dissemination were successful methods for minimizing the time for this work to become practice. This in addition to the use of online platforms can replace conventional methods which take longer and become quickly outdated. "}

We advanced the redox scanning technique by measuring the nominal concentrations (in reference to the frozen solution standards) of the endogenous fluorescent analytes, i.e., [NADH] and [Fp] to quantify the redox ratios in various biological tissues. The advancement has enabled us to identify an array of the redox indices as quantitative imaging biomarkers (including [NADH], [Fp], [Fp]/([NADH] + [Fp]), [NADH]/[Fp], and their standard deviations) for studying some important biological questions on cancer and normal tissue metabolism. We found that the redox indices were associated or changed with (1) tumorigenesis (cancer versus non-cancer of human breast tissue biopsies); (2) tumor metastatic potential; (3) tumor glucose uptake; (4) tumor p53 status; (5) PI3K pathway activation in premalignant tissue; (6) therapeutic effects on tumors; (7) embryonic stem cell differentiation; (8) the heart under fasting. Together, our work demonstrated that the tissue redox indices obtained from the redox scanning technique may provide useful information about tissue metabolism and physiology status in normal and diseased tissues. The Chance redox scanner and other redox imaging techniques may have wide-ranging potential applications in many fields, such as cancer, diabetes, developmental process, mitochondrial diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging.

{"PMID":31824989,"Title":"Navigating the landscape of non-health administrative data in Scotland: A researcher's narrative.","Abstract":" Background: There is growing interest in using routinely collected administrative data for research purposes. Following the success of research using routinely collected healthcare data, attention has turned to leveraging routinely-collected non-health data derived from systems providing other services to the population (e.g., education, social security) to conduct research on important social problems. In Scotland, specialised organisations have been set up to support researchers in their pursuit of using and linking administrative data. The landscape of administrative data in Scotland, however, is complex and changeable, and is often difficult for researchers to navigate. Purpose: This paper provides a researcher's narrative of the steps required to gain the various approvals necessary to access and link non-health administrative data for research in social and cognitive epidemiology. Findings: This paper highlights the problems, particularly regarding the length and complexity of the process, which researchers typically face, and which result in a challenging research environment. The causes of these problems are discussed, as are potential solutions. Conclusions: Whereas the potential of non-health administrative data is great, more work and investment are needed on the part of all those concerned - from researchers to data controllers - in order to realise this potential.

Unfortunately, the situation has not received much attention in the African region. The aim of this study was to investigate whether current personal ambient NO2 and benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylenes (ortho (o)-, meta (m)- and para (p)-xylene (BTEX) exposure is associated with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a marker of molecular ageing, in apparently healthy women (mean ± SD age: 42.5 ± 13.4 years) residing in the Cape Town region of South Africa. The repeated measures study collected data from 61 women. Seven-day median (interquartile range (IQR)) personal NO2 and BTEX exposure levels were determined via compact passive diffusion samplers carried on the person prior to baseline (NO2: 14.2 (9.4-17.2) μg/m³; Benzene: 3.1 (2.1-5.3) μg/m³) and 6-month follow-up (NO2: 10.6 (6.6-13.6) μg/m³; Benzene: 2.2 (1.3-4.9) μg/m³) visits. LTL was measured at baseline and follow-up using a real-time PCR method. Multiple linear mixed model analyses (adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking, employment status, level of education and assessment visit) showed that each IQR increment increase in NO2 (7.0 μg/m³) and benzene (3.3 μg/m³) was associated with -7.30% (95% CI: -10.98 to -3.46%; p < 0.001) and -6.78% (95% CI: -11.88 to -1.39%; p = 0.015) difference in LTL, respectively. The magnitude of these effects of NO2 and benzene corresponds to the effect of an increase of 10.3- and 6.0-year in chronological age on LTL. Our study shows that personal exposures to NO2 and benzene are associated with molecular ageing as indicated by LTL in healthy women residing in the Cape Town region. Copyright © 2019.

Presence of depression, anxiety or stress in pregnancy may increase the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of neonatal outcomes and its association among mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus with and without the presence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in Malaysia. This was a cross-sectional study. Tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. Mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 418) who deliver their neonates at two major tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. Neonatal outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, macrosomia, metabolic and electrolyte disorders, neonatal respiratory distress and congenital anomalies were determined. Prevalence of low birth weight in neonates born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus was 14.6%, followed by metabolic and electrolyte disorders 10.5%, preterm birth 9.1%, macrosomia 4.8%, neonatal respiratory distress 5.8% and congenital anomalies (2.4%). Among the adverse neonatal outcomes, neonatal respiratory distress was significantly associated with the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus using univariate analysis (p = 0.010). After controlling for confounding factors, predictors for neonatal respiratory distress at delivery were the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (Adjusted OR = 3.87, 95% CI = 1.32-11.35), living without a husband (Adjusted OR = 9.74, 95% CI = 2.04-46.51), preterm delivery (Adjusted OR = 7.20, 95% CI = 2.23-23.30), caesarean section (Adjusted OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.09-10.15), being nulliparous and primiparous (Adjusted OR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.17-11.17) and having family history of diabetes (Adjusted OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.11-9.21). The findings of this study demonstrate the positive association of neonatal respiratory distress with the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus. It is therefore important to identify depression symptoms after a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant mothers is made to enable early referral and interventions. Copyright © 2019.

We have developed a new system (ALZENTIA) that helps detect early MCI, mainly caused by AD. The system is based on a hidden goal task (HGT) in which the human subject has to find a target that is not visible; as such, the navigation is based on a previously memorized target position, in relation to the starting position (egocentric variant) and/or other navigational landmarks (allocentric variant of the task). We present our preliminary results obtained in 33 patients with MCI and 91 healthy controls (HC). Between-group differences in the average error measured in allocentric, egocentric, and combined allocentric-egocentric subtests were statistically significant in MCI compared to HC. The high negative predictive values suggested high discriminative capacity and diagnostic potential for the HGT test as a tool to detect subjects in healthy population who will progress to MCI. Considering the low sensitivity of the Mini-Mental Status Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment tests, we believe that HGT can improve early identification of MCI patients who will progress to AD. The HGT carried out with the ALZENTIA system proved to be a reliable screening test to identify individuals with MCI from an aging cohort. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V. "}

We used data from 2223 patients with acute stroke consecutively admitted to an Italian Stroke Unit (SU) between 2010 and 2015. Information from medical records and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured on admission was retrospectively used to screen for diabetes and prediabetes defined according to standard criteria. Overall rate of diabetes undiagnosed at admission and diabetes still undiagnosed at SU discharge were 9.7% and 6.7% but age-specific prevalence peaked up to 12.0% and 9.0% after age 80. At admission, the proportion of all undiagnosed diabetes on total diabetes cases was one out of every two cases before age 60 and three out of every four cases after age 80. In these same age intervals, one out of every three diabetes cases was still undiagnosed at SU discharge. Regardless of age, about three out of ten patients with acute stroke had prediabetes. Less than 2% of these patients had a prediabetes diagnosis before or after SU admission. In patients with acute stroke, diabetes is substantially underdiagnosed before age 60 and after age 80. Prediabetes is highly prevalent but mostly undiagnosed at all ages. (199 words). Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V. "}

However, the relevant mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of ANGII and/or candesartan, a ANGII-Type-1 Receptor (AT1R) antagonist, and PD123319, a ANGII-Type-2 Receptor (AT2R) antagonist on expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), ferroportin 1 (Fpn1)and ferritin as well as iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), hepcidin and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in Neuro-2a cells. We demonstrated that ANGII induces a significant reduction in expression of TfR1, Fpn1, IRP2 proteins and Nrf2 mRNA and an increase in ferritin protein and hepcidin mRNA, while candesartan, but not PD123319, significantly attenuated or reversed all these ANGII-induced changes in Neuro-2a cells. These findings imply that ANGII down-regulates TfR1 expression likely via the AT1R/IRP2 pathway, and Fpn1 expression via ATR1/hepcidin and AT1R/ Nrf2 pathways. Copyright © 2019.

After the experiment period (at 18 months of age), animals were euthanized and the prostate and other organs were harvested, dissected, weighed, and processed for morphological, ultrastructural and molecular analyses. We demonstrated that male rats of Wistar strain nicely recapitulate the carcinogenesis process taking place in the aging prostate through the arising of benign, precancerous and malignant lesions, and above all yields a modest incidence of spontaneous PCa (~36%). Moreover, our results highlight that 100% incidence of PCa and precancerous lesions such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and proliferative inflammatory atrophy were achieved in this rat strain after T + E2 treatment, without changing the broad spectrum of changes that naturally emerge in the prostate at advanced ages. Such enhancement of precancerous lesions and tumors was linked to a decreased expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in parallel with an increase in Vimentin and N-cadherin, hallmark modifications of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our findings provide solid evidence that aged Wistar rats may be an excellent model for studies regarding human prostate biology and related disorders including cancer. Copyright © 2019.

EPA:DHA 6:1 has been identified as a potent omega 3 PUFA formulation to induce endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). This study examined whether intake of EPA:DHA 6:1 (500 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks improves an established endothelial dysfunction in old rats (20 months old), and, if so, the underlying mechanism was subsequently determined. In the main mesenteric artery rings, an endothelial dysfunction characterized by a blunted NO component, an abolished endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization component, and increased endothelium-dependent contractile responses (EDCFs) are observed in old rats compared to young rats. Age-related endothelial dysfunction was associated with increased vascular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of eNOS, components of the local angiotensin system, senescence markers, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the downregulation of COX-1. The EPA:DHA 6:1 treatment improved the NO-mediated relaxation, reduced the EDCF-dependent contractile response and the vascular formation of ROS, and normalized the expression level of all target proteins in the old arterial wall. Thus, the present findings indicate that a 2-week intake of EPA:DHA 6:1 by old rats restored endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations, most likely, by preventing the upregulation of the local angiotensin system and the subsequent formation of ROS.

{"PMID":31830387,"Title":"[The challenge of the peripheral Nephrological Center: an Italian story].","Abstract":" In small peripheral nephrological hospitals it can sometimes be difficult to obtain an early diagnosis and to ensure a state-of-the-art treatment. In the most complex cases, in fact, patients must be transferred to the closest Nephrological Referral Center in order to recover kidney function or improve the chance of survival. Other challenges are represented by the progressive ageing of the population and by the management of oncological patients developing kidney complications, for which it would be desirable to create dedicated clinics. However, small hospitals also offer many advantages, such as better work management, the opportunity to attend many training initiatives and congresses, and the ability to better balance career with family needs. Cooperating in smaller teams and the harmony that develops with the other physicians and nurses allows us to offer the best healthcare to nephropathic patients who live far away from the major Referral Centers. Each peripheral Center can also represent an essential resource for the major Center because it acts as the first point of contact with patients, taking care of identifying the situations that need the attention of the Referral Center and, subsequently, taking charge of the follow-up in conservative or replacement therapy.

Large, simple, cardiovascular trials have successfully discovered treatments with moderate but worthwhile effects to prevent heart attack and stroke. The design of these trials may hold lessons for the dementia prevention. Here we outline suitable populations, interventions and outcomes for large simple trials in dementia prevention. We consider what features are needed to maximise efficiency. Populations could be selected by age, clinical or genetic risk factors or clinical presentation. Patients and their families prioritise functional and clinical outcomes over cognitive scores and levels of biomarkers. Loss of particular functions or dementia diagnoses therefore are most meaningful to participants and potential patients and can be measured in large trials. The size of the population and duration of follow-up needed for dementia prevention trials will be a major challenge and will need collaboration between many clinical investigators, funders and patient organisations. © The Author(s) 2019.

{"PMID":31830255,"Title":"Plasticity in the growth habit prolongs survival at no physiological cost in a monocarpic perennial at high altitudes.","Abstract":" Monocarpic plants are those that flower, produce seeds and then die. Although most monocarpic plants are annual or biennial, some of them are perennial. However, relatively little is known of the biology of monocarpic perennials. Pyrenean saxifrage (Saxifraga longifolia Lapeyr.) is a monocarpic perennial that is well adapted to high-mountain ecosystems. Here, we evaluate altitudinal changes in clonality in various populations growing in their natural habitat with particular emphasis on the physiological costs of clonal growth. We assessed the percentage of clonal plants in nine populations growing in their natural habitat, as well as the plant stress response of clonal and non-clonal plants, in terms of photoprotection and accumulation of stress-related phytohormones, in a three-year study at Las Blancas (2,100 m a.s.l.). We also evaluated the influence of plant size on the activation of defensive responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. We found that 12% of Pyrenean saxifrage plants growing at the highest altitudes (2,100 m a.s.l.) produced lateral rosettes which survived the flowering of the main rosette and shared the same axonomorphic root, thus escaping monocarpic senescence. This clonal growth did not worsen the physiological performance of plants growing at this altitude. Furthermore, increased plant size did not negatively affect the physiology of plants, despite adjustments in endogenous stress-related phytohormones. In contrast, maturity led to rapid physiological deterioration of the rosette, which was associated with monocarpic senescence. This study shows that the evolution of clonality has allowed Pyrenean saxifrage to survive harsh environmental conditions and it provides evidence that harsh environments push plant species to their limits in terms of life form and longevity. © The Author(s) 2019.

Specifically, we assessed patterns of overlap between diffusion measures of normal appearing white matter by covarying for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load, as WMHs are thought to increase with age and impact diffusion measures. 79 healthy adults aged between 18 and 75 took part in the study. DTI data were based on 61 directions acquired with a b-value of 2000. We found 5 main patterns of overlap: FA alone (15.95%); FA and RD (31.90%); FA and AD (12.99%); FA, RD and AD (27.93%); FA RD, and MD (8.79%). We showed that cognitively healthy aging adults had low WMH load, which subsequently had minimal effect on diffusion measures. We discuss how patterns of overlap may reflect underlying biological changes observed with aging such as loss of myelination, axonal damage, as well as mild microstructural and chronic white matter impairments. This study contributes to understanding the underlying causes of degeneration in specific regions of the brain and highlights the importance of considering the impact of WMHs in aging studies of white matter. © The Author(s) 2019.
